Jay H.,/user_details?userid=vomeBb0d4JuSCxxnef1lYg,"New York, NY",4/29/2022,4.0,The ramen here is decent. I had the spicy volcano tonkatsu ramen and my friend had the non spicy version. It was quite typical. The items I liked most was actually the karage and takoyaki. Those were the best out of all the things I've tried there. I also order the Thai iced tea but that was meh since it was mostly ice. Overall it was good and clean place with nicely decorated interior. Apparently there's an outdoor space.

Peggy C.,/user_details?userid=QSZMGUOTGdVHCgVABjo2BA,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",5/27/2022,4.0,More like 3.5. We didn't try many things so I am giving the benefit of the doubt and rounding up. Spicy volcano tonkatsu ramen and the spicy miso ramen were both decent-- not the best you can have but satisfyingly average. I did not feel the broth was overly salty but I did think it lacked some depth. Portions and toppings were good for the price. Our server was very pleasant and the decor was cute.

The vegetarian ramen noodle soup, veggie gyozas, and salad were really good.. I must have been really hungry because I ate it so quickly. The waiter we had was so good with our 2.5 year old son, in fact they were cracking jokes all night and he even humored him when he started asking for tacos and wanted to take home the mushroom statues. So I would definitely say that this place is very kid friendly. There was another table there that also had a kid around the same age as my son and they were able to play together for a bit. We were even offered a boze Bluetooth speaker to play our own music outdoors. All in all great experience and a beautiful summer night to eat outdoors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/menya-and-izakaya-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Inside this low lit parlor level restaurant you'll find a pretty decent bar area in the middle of two designated dining spaces in the back and in the front. The service here is amazing. I love being walked through the menu and getting descriptions down to the flavor profiles extra points on wine pairings and you will definitely experience all of that here. All of the plates are pretty different from one another so it's hard to pin down exactly what the cuisine is. But they focus on seasonality and freshness at the forefront. The muscles in an octopus ink sauce we're not only striking an appearance, but flavor as well- very refreshing. I also really enjoy the beef tongue. It was so tender and remind me a pastrami in the best way. And even though I've had it so many times the fried mushrooms were amazing. The batter was so light and crispy. It was unlike any fried mushrooms I've had before. The most lackluster thing I had was the steak and at that price point skip it and grab some other interesting small plates, instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/place-des-f%C3%AAtes-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friend walked in to put our name on the list for a table, and another party who also walked in was seated before us. It was a bit disorganized. We were seated at the 'drink bar' and the bar stools were uncomfortable. We ordered drinks, and my wine glass was warm. There were no silverware or place settings until after they brought our first course. We ordered all four courses and dessert, and by the end my back was hurting from sitting on the stool and leaning over the bar by the end.

If you buy the bass, the steak, or whatever protein, it will be soaked in butter which is how unskilled chefs at Great American Restaurants make things ""taste good.""  I have never eaten here and not had diarrhea for 2 days because of the butter. Tonight, I got the Southwestern Salad which turned out not to be a salad at all but a  rich salty, buttery, pile of what I would consider, more like salad dressing, that one could possibly scatter sparingly over actual greens to make something palatable and not waste it. I just go there because my kids like the place for sentimental reasons, despite that they get diarrhea every time from the butter food too. It makes no sense to me! The beer was good, but I am convinced that Sweetwater fans are in denial of the correlation between eating at SweetWater and 2-day diarrhea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I gave the tacos a chance and they are by far one of the best tacos I've had in my life. The steak was perfectly cooked, the guac was fresh with the perfect amount of lemon, the green salsa left me wanting more, the queso fresco - amazing, and finally the corn tortillas tasted homemade but can't confirm that.

Ofelia E.,/user_details?userid=pFvJD_u68-FSvXKnluTDqA,"New York, NY",3/5/2021,5.0,"So glad I checked this place out last night, everything was delicious! There were no reservation slots for 7pm available but we decided to stop by anyway. They didn't have anything indoors available so we were seated outside in the front. They have individual compartments for each table with a heater in each, so even though it was cold we were comfortable. Still, make sure to dress warmly. We started off with the fried calamari and the French onion soup. The calamari was crispy and tasted fresh, paired perfectly with a side of arugula. The French onion soup was served piping hot which is exactly what we needed, it was so tasty. Lots of flavor and a good portion to be split amongst 2. Then we got the hanger steak and the Sweetwater burger. My boyfriend said the burger was good but nothing amazing. The fries however, he loved. I really liked my hanger steak. It was juicy and tasted really great for a cheap price. It was served with lightly battered onion rings which were fried perfectly and not stringy. Everything was beautifully presented and the staff were super friendly and fast! Everything came out quickly and they were attentive without being too intrusive. Make sure you also get their bread basket too with the olive oil with balsamic, so so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Our waitress took it back but then another women came back out with the steak asking us to check it again because she thought it was medium rare.

I was across the street when it started raining really heavy and I quickly ran to this place because the other restaurant did not want to serve us due to my allergy. This place was so accommodating, especially since we came right as they were closing, they gave us multiple tables because it kept raining on us, and made sure our night wasn't ruined. My friends and I all ordered the chickpea curry dish with shrimp, it was delicious. Somewhat spicy, and it was similar to a broth or soup that we dipped the sourdough bread in, such a great dinner option. The backyard seating was very cute, and so photo worthy. Overall, 10/10 experience and it definitely made my day way less horrible than it was.

We ordered the lentil burger (made it vegan) which came with sweet potato fries, sea bass with mashed potatoes and string beans (fish was so good but the string beans /mashed potatoes were OK), we also got Parmesan truffle fries, so good!

Kristiana M.,/user_details?userid=i6PMW5hjUTe-s9RikyTL3Q,"Northport, NY",4/19/2019,5.0,My boyfriend and I have been here twice now and loved it both times. Highly recommend the octopus art art with its unique pesto fennel.  If they have the white fish special also get it! My boyfriends mother got it and I really regretted not getting it over my lentils curry which was good but not nearly as good as the fish she got. Lastly the mussels were fabulous and we were all fighting over the broth in the end. Friendly service easy to reserve a table especially at 5:30pm on a Sunday. The building ambiance's def impressed my boy friends parents too.

Gato J.,/user_details?userid=kYbOwxYGzAOrzQvWV7g5Cg,"Dallas, TX",7/3/2019,1.0,"Let me tell you what happened yesterday around 5 PM at Sweetwater. I was sitting on the patio and the resturant was almost completely empty. I had two friends with me and my dogs and we were eating and drinking when I became over heated and excused myself to go sit inside in the air conditioning. I sat a table near the bar and started to get worse and the room was spinning and I started sweating profusely. I was fighting to keep my eyes open and stay in a seated position. I waved for my friends when the door was opened to the patio becuase I felt at that point that I couldn't walk but they didn't notice me. The waitstaff of the restaurant were rude and I guess they didn't recognize me from the patio and kept trying to get my order and offer me a menu. How crazy is that?! At one point I politely asked for a cold wet towel one girl made a face and went over to a sink and got a paper towel that she ran under the tap. She brought it over and it was room temperature. I was very quiet and polite through the whole event though the staff acted like I was this huge inconvenience. The bartender acted angry the entire time and when she finally realised I wasn't going to order anything she asked if I was feeling OK. I told her that I thought I might be having a heatstroke and she made a face and walked to the other end of the bar. I guess they thought I was a drunk or something. I was having margaritas (watered down, very weak margaritas) on the patio earlier. But not enough to make me intoxicated and I was eating and drinking a lot of water at the same time. My friends finally saw me and came to help. I haven't felt right since then, even after drinking glass after glass of ice water. So I have just called and told a very young sounding supervisor what happened to me at her restaurant. She reacted in glib manner and seemed not to take me seriously. The entire event was very odd to say the least and I'm still not sure what to think about it. Was the waitstaff just young and inexperienced and unfamiliar with what being overheated looked like? I think its probably more to do with the waitstaff looking at customers as how they make money and not as people. I was very respectful and polite through the whole event and I have been going to Sweetwater for years and always tip well and have been a great customer. But I feel that Sweetwater is just trying to make a buck and if a customer is having trouble then that customer becomes an annoyance. My advice is go spend your money at someplace that looks at its customers as human.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sylvia M.,/user_details?userid=rspL1jUYami4uuWsmdiRvA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/16/2017,4.0,"I was referred to this place by a friend who is a chef so I wanted to try it for awhile. My favorite part is the back garden. When we arrived it was occupied but very soon we got a table in the garden, so i was happy about that. Food was very good, well prepared, and there is thought into it. They are allergy sensitive and vegan friendly. No vegan desert though. Servers where polite and accommodating but definitely needs a bit more attention, water on the table before we ask, we waited for about ten minutes for water and then we had to ask for the bread. No salt and pepper on our table. They seem to be slow and tired, which i get, i worked in a restaurant for years. Just certain things should be no brainer, that is why we dine out versus staying home. Food gets 10 out of ten, if you add a gluten & dairy free dessert, you have me. But because i love the garden chances are, i am going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Paul T.,/user_details?userid=A8IU9FxUx_2e1lzgOzAsjA,"Houston, TX",3/11/2012,4.0,"We had dinner at Sweetwater last night and our first clue that it was going to be good was that there was a pretty good crowd in there when we looking for a spot around 6:30, unlike most of the other well-rated eateries in Williamsburg that were all mostly empty. The place just filled up and got busier as the night wore on. The food amply justified all this patronage and the wait staff was helpful, friendly and attentive. Nice neighborhood bistro ambience, albeit busy. Not really the call for a quiet romantic evening, but a warm and friendly feeling and a charming atmosphere. Waiters working hard to make it work, floaters pitching in to keep it going. Our table sampled the fried calamari, which was pretty darn good and we're picky about that; light, fresh and tender; the surest clue that a restaurant has a high quality bar. We also had the onion soup with gruyere which won a strong nod, the sausage and bean soup was terrific, and the rib eye steak was outstanding. My wife and I shared the pork tenderloin and the beet and feta salad, both excellent.

The only thing that may freak you out is the dried shrimp, which has tiny black eyes that you can see. Definitely a place that you should try.

The flavors work and I couldn't stop eating the taro balls and red bean toppings. I think the herbal jelly was just okay, maybe because mine felt like they were scraps from whats left of the batch.

However when it came time to pay the bill we noticed they had charged us for one more item that we were told was included. NBD, we thought, right? Just remove the $5 extra charge on our $300+ bill and move on? Instead, our waiter decided to fervently argue with us over such a small charge, and refuted us, even raising his voice instead of removing the charge we all agreed hadn't been correct. I'm sorry but is it really worth it to argue with your table over $5 on a large check? It left such a bad taste in my mouth, I wouldn't return.

Alexis B.,/user_details?userid=h7p-GuaHFGsiKCF4g6Bjqg,"Baltimore, MD",6/25/2022,3.0,"We had dinner at Sofreh a few weeks ago, and it was good but not great. We ate: a baby red gem lettuce salad with Mejdool dates, radish, tahini and honey dressing, and toasted sesame seeds; maitake mushrooms with sunchokes and whey; kofteh made with beef, tarragon, rice, and split peas and served in tomato saffron broth and topped with yogurt; half duck Fesenjan: braised leg of duck in pomegranate walnut sauce served with pan roasted duck breast; a side of saffron rice; and a side of tahdig. We also had some drinks: a Tehran dirty martini (TIto's and pickled almond brine), wine, and Persian black tea. The food was good overall. I did think the duck breast was overcooked, but the braised leg was good. The service was a little confusing, too. I'm not even sure who our server was, because several different people stopped by our table but no one ever really introduced themselves as our server. We had to try to get staff's attention a few times to order food and to order more drinks, and we weren't really sure who we were supposed to ask. They were definitely busy, but service was not attentive. Overall, the meal was a little bit of a letdown. I had made sure to get a reservation during the long holiday weekend we were going to be in New York, and I had really been looking forward to the meal. Maybe because of how much I had been looking forward to it, the experience was a little bit of a letdown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sofreh-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I can't recall everything we ate, see photos. The apps and ice cream were all of our faves. We took the advice of the waiter about what to order and weren't at all disappointed.

However you don't wanna miss the opportunity to eat here. The food is really high quality and flavor profile is unique. The lamb was my favorite dish. So tender it fell off the bone. It also still had a ton of flavor. The tahini and date salad has a nice and spicy tahini dressing. The stew was a lot lighter of a meal than it looks. The rice is a classic and very tasty.

Elica S.,/user_details?userid=pQDD98xT8CoRCsyqjc1vRw,"Coral Gables, FL",7/1/2022,1.0,"I will say that the food was incredibly delicious. However, the reason for my low rating is due to the customer service and hospitality. The waitress (who was incredibly nice, warm and respectful) accidentally forgot a few of our dishes during our order. When we notified her, she of course put in the order. However this meant that a bulk of our dishes arrived late. We didn't have a chance to order dessert yet, when one of the managers (it was a man) came over and in an incredibly rude tone said we were nearing the 2 hour mark on our table and that we would need to pay and leave. We of course were behind because the main dishes came out much later than expected. This manager took our plates and we didn't even get a chance to order any dessert. I completely understand a 2 hour limit, however, when the delay is due to the mistake of the restaurant, you should not take that out on your customers and secondly, do not express it in a rude way. This completely changed my view of the restaurant. One of the main aspects of Persian culture that is well known in the whole world is for its incredible warmth and hospitality and the leadership at Sofreh are in exact opposition of that quality of Persian culture. Its incredibly unfortunate since the food was delicious. However, the way you treat people is important aspect of the food industry and unfortunately they did not treat us with kindness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sofreh-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The service is good although definitely on the pushy side as other reviews had noted. The eggplant appetizer was good but not outstanding. The bread that came with it was original and great. But if you wanted more it was $8 for one little piece of bread which is absurd. $8 for a plate of rice. Again nothing was terrible but for the price the portions were tiny and the taste underwhelming. I had the braised beef as the main dish and it was just ok. In hindsight I would not have minded skipping the main dish and ordering more appetizers. Good ambience and clean restaurant.

I forgot her name but she knew the menu from start to finish and her recommendations were on point. The runners and manager that supported her were attentive as well. The bartender made my 2 year this cute lil non alcoholic apple cocktail which I wanted myself. LOVED! The cocktails virgin and non virgin were all tasty and flavorful and mixed well. Please try the mint/cucumber cooler!! The food was just delicious. now please be reminded, Persian food is not for the faint and the flavors and sauces are a bit heavy but I guess coming from a Caribbean background I can roll with it. The cauliflower was perfectly done and the accompanying pickled vegetables were so good. Meatball delish.. the side bread was fresh and warm and lightly crisped.. So I knew I wasn't going to be a fan of the rice because Im not a fan of seasoned rice (hella picky) but everyone else enjoyed. The lamb was super tender and perfect. I would've preferred the butter beans to be cooked a bit more as they were a bit on the hard side. still a great dish. We also had the ribeye which my daughter enjoyed.. a bit fatty but I'm sure it added to the flavor. For dessert, the saffron cake wasn't really a hot for me me but it wasn't bad.

R W.,/user_details?userid=JmPvxrp09cVIT0CIvPFlAg,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",5/12/2022,2.0,"This was a disappointing experience. The food good, the service bad. The waitress was intensely pushy about taking our order. She asked us what we wanted three seconds after we sat down and came back another two times. We asked her about the menu, asked her about the portions of the starters and how many we should get because my friend and I like to share and get a variety. She told us the portions were very small and showed us with her hand the sizes of the various starters (looked tiny) so we ordered based on that and she said it wouldn't be enough, and we could not order more later if we wanted (why I don't know) so she advised us to get in addition to what we ordered a rice dish and a main course which we did, based on her suggestion. The whole time she was very impatient with us and rushed us. All of a sudden everything came out en masse- piled up on our table one after the other- and the dishes were not that small- in fact the portions were generous enough. We clearly over ordered! It was way too much food so we quickly told her to cancel the main and she came back and said it was too late. So we were shoving this food down our throats, feeling rushed and couldn't really enjoy what would have been good food and a nice culinary experience. We had to ask the waitress to box everything to go because we couldn't eat it fast enough and we needed more space on the table as things came out. Then two minutes after the last dish came out (the main course we could barely eat), a man came over gave us our bill and told us we had to leave the table because there was someone else with a reservation waiting for the table (they didn't even ask if we wanted dessert). We were finishing our food and glasses of wine, and he came over to us again, telling us to pay and finish our wine at the bar. Ok, I get it but we weren't there that long (maybe a little over an hour) but in the meantime, two guys who sat down next to us at the same time were not kicked out of their table. We went to the bar to finish our wine, and noticed those guys were sitting leisurely, finishing their food, and never left their table, nor were told to leave their table. All in all, this was a bad experience. The food was good- and the type of unusual and nuanced spices and variety of food on the menu should be savored and enjoyed- not thrown in front of you and rushed like McDonald's.

I was very excited to try this place as I am Iranian and want to support an Iranian business. I left an email to postpone my reservation because my friend was not feeling well (later I found out she had COVID) and a woman called me back saying that she will cancel my reservation without charging me $20 per person. I ended up still getting charged $40 and no matter how much I explained my situation via email, they would not accept a refund. They also replied back in the rudest way and then proceeded to stop replying all together. They are a money hungry institution ( also proven in the other reviews I am reading below mine) and coming from an Iranian foundation, I am shocked because the culture values generosity and hospitality.

Friday and Saturday night reservations are harder to get but Sunday night reservations were relatively open. We reserved through Yelp online, which has you confirm the reservation the day before. The space inside is pretty intimate, great for a date night or nice dinner with friends. I saw they have one high chair so they are baby friendly. I loved the decor inside: white, crisp, clean lines. We got the eggplant appetizer, the traditional herb noodle soup, the chicken with plum sauce, crispy rice and herb rice. The soup was my favorite. The flavors were amazing and the crispiness of the fried onions was great. The crispy rice was a little bit too hard and crunchy for me but the herb rice was great. I also tried their bourbon, beet reduction with egg white cocktail and it was fantastic. For dessert we tried the rose custard and the persian ice cream. The ice cream was better as I felt the custard texture was a little bit pasty, although the flavor was great. I would definitely come back and try the lamb shank, fish of the day and the vermicelli noodle dessert.  Those looked great on neighboring tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sofreh-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The decor is a bit chilly, I would almost call it anti-ethnic, as in, wanting to really signal that this is a cut above your ethnic food joint. But it somehow leaves you cold.

For the entree, got the stew of butter beans and dill ($18) which came with basmati rice. It was good and not too heavy.

Lorrie M.,/user_details?userid=k7jpc5lJp7_ZhQf9xYysjA,"Brooklyn, NY",7/14/2019,1.0,At first Sofreh seemed to be a warm place to dine and the hostess was very welcoming. We sat on the outside and were already eating when we were approached by a woman who said that we had to leave in 30min because she had a reservation that was coming. We definitely felt racially profiled because we were the only ones of color sitting outside and on the property. We were told outside seating was for walk-ins and we were taken aback by how we were approached and treated.  She made it clear she was the owner; assuming that was her tactic to push us out of our seats.

One difficulty: if you have nut allergies, you're out of luck with quite a few apps and some mains - but there are great options for vegetarians! I, being not a vegetarian like my friends, had the lamb; it was amazing. Pairs well with the herb rice.

I also want to say that as a Persian American growing up with Persian food I've been to many Persian restaurants and this is probably the most over priced and weird restaurant that I have been to. The yogurt and shallots were subpar which was disappointing because it's my favorite Persian app when I go out, and this particular restaurant charges so much so I figured it'd be good. The thing that really set me off is the fact that I had to ask for sumac (which every Persian restaurant usually has in a salt shaker on the table) which they gave me a pinch of. When I asked for more the poor waitress said ""I'm not sure if I can they got mad when I gave you some in the first place"". What kind of authentic Persian restaurant is this? I know that this is something very petty to be upset about but when my family is about to spend almost $200 on our dinner I'd like to at least have a spice I always put on my rice and not feel like I'm robbing the kitchen.

The cauliflower is so flavorful that I actually remembered how good it was even weeks later, which I feel is hard to do when cauliflower dishes are on so many menus. We got the lamb shank and the half chicken, both of which were delicious. I expected the chicken to have similar flavors to the traditional fesenjoon dish, and in a way it did, but it was so much better. The chicken was so juicy and tender and flavorful, and the saffron sauce on it was truly out of this world, but the lamb shank was the real standout. I think we were all fighting to get more and more of this dish before it finished. We also had a side of rice and the feta flatbread, so I'd say we maybe over ordered on savory food. Everything was delicious, but it was a lot of food. Despite this, I insisted on ordering dessert and got the ice cream sandwich. It was truly spectacular.

The entire evening we had to raise our voices to the loud clamoring of utensils, dishes, and the dishwashers. It was constant. They only thing they could offer was a tiny table to switch to which one of us would be sitting in the main entrance area. Point is, you should not make a table next to a ""dish pit"" and I think its particularly unacceptable at the price point to do so. When I mentioned this TWICE to the manager, she then said ""well no one else has never complained about it"", the equivalent of ""it must be your problem."" CUSTOMER SERVICE 101.

Definitely an added bonus. While I could tell there was a staffing shortage, the service was still good and very fast. I got a Bee Knees, which was particularly delicious. The cocktails weren't overly sweet and really refreshing. I went with the sausage and orrechiette. Absolute YUM. The portion was plentiful and the ratio of cheese to pasta to sausage was really delicious. That slight bit of spice was quite a kick that wrapped the dish together.

We came here for a late lunch and it was pretty empty, which we thought meant would be more attentive service and less wait times.. it was quite the opposite. We ordered all our drinks and food in the first 5 minutes and the drinks slowly started coming out within 15 minutes. But we waited nearly 45 minutes for the food, which I thought was ridiculous, considering we were the only ones there at this point. Now, I know that the servers have nothing to do w kitchen wait times, I'm very patient usually but what disappointed me was that nobody seemed to do anything about it. He didn't really care nor did he even pretend to check w the kitchen LOL. Things like that lower the experience for me and overall lower the quality of the food.

She suggested the pulled pork Benedict so i ordered that and my mom ordered the spring bowl with salmon. Both dishes came out quickly and were so incredible.

Our food arrived before our coffees, which we had to remind them to retrieve, and the food took ages. The food was basically cold, but we'd been waiting for so long by then that I scarfed it down. My wife ordered a hot chocolate; whoever prepared it needs to be advised that there is no such thing as ""unsweetened hot chocolate""; i.e. a mug of hot water with cocoa powder is not a hot chocolate, it's a hot gross drink. At no point did our server ever acknowledge any of this. No apology when we had to order our drinks again after receiving our food first. Never asked how anything was. Never thanked us. I have no idea why i even gave him a lousy tip, he deserved no tip. I got the sense that they were understaffed but come on, at least acknowledge that, be nice to your customers, ask for their patience...any of those things and i absolutely don't mind.

Made reservations for two on a Saturday night through Yelp same day which was awesome. Their outdoor seating arrangement is actually very nice and almost feels enclosed. I hate being cold while I'm eating and I was definitely fearing this but luckily they had their heating lamps on full gear and made it feel nice and toasty. I will say their menu seems a bit limited and would love more options, nonetheless the food was delicious. I had the Vietnamese fried chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had the shrimp pappardelle which he loved so much! He couldn't stop talking about how good it was. Their portion sizes are also perfect! My only complaint which really had nothing to do with the restaurant was about the front desk staff at the hotel that it's connected to. When we left, we walked in through the hotel to use the restroom and told the woman that we had just came from the restaurant and she said that next time we need to go through the restaurant inside so that it doesn't look like we're random people just trying to use a bathroom.

Farah G.,/user_details?userid=7KmDkQr1-HN6Ua-olZKWwA,"Centereach, NY",8/7/2021,1.0,"I was really excited to try this restaurant because I had read pretty great reviews and I loved the decor! I'm giving them one star because the drink I had was incredible-- I highly recommend the Brazilian Sunrise, it's light, not too sweet, and just delicious! I also suppose they tried to impose a gesture of hospitality when everything went awry with dinner. I came here with a friend and we ordered the roasted cauliflower to start which tasted amazing, but took a relatively decent amount of time to come (perhaps 20 min) and was lukewarm. After waiting another 30 min for our entrees (2 hanger steaks medium rare with steak frites) we had to stop the waiter and ask where our food was. He said he'd check with the kitchen and then came back to report that there had been a ""miscommunication and our orders would be out soon"". We had waited about an hour for our food at that point, so he was kind enough to comp the entrees. We continued to drink and 15 minutes passed, then 20, then 30, then 45.. and still no steaks in sight. We stopped him AGAIN to ask where our food was since it had now been 2 hours since we ordered, and he said he'd check with the kitchen and then in about 5 more minutes, our entrees come out. My friend and I immediately looked at our brownish grey steaks, and not only could we tell that they were WELL DONE but they were essentially cold. The fries were also cold and tasteless. We asked our waiter why it took 2 hours to get the wrong steaks and by this time since it was 10pm, we were starving so we just wanted to send our steaks back and get them cooked the way we ordered them--medium rare. His reply to us was that they "" just ran out of steaks for the night"". As a New York City restaurant on a Friday night, I couldn't believe that this was true and I have never heard something so absurd in my life. The restaurant was barely at half capacity! We immediately asked for the check and we left. The service was abominable Our initial waitress checked on us once after giving us our appetizer snd drinks, clearly never put in our entree order and then she just left without notice and our new waiter only spoke to us when we flagged him down which was once every HOUR that we waited for the wrong food. I'm happy that they comped us for our entrees (again, probably the only reason they're getting even 1 star) but we still had a nearly $120 bill for drinks and our lukewarm cauliflower appetizer. I take choosing restaurants very seriously and as a native New Yorker, I was so disappointed and embarrassed to bring a friend to this establishment. I'm writing this review to warn others that maybe they were having a bad night, or maybe this restaurant simply isn't worth going to. I sincerely hope someone from management sees this review and works diligently for this mistake to never happen again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/hole-in-the-wall-new-york-13?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Brian R.,/user_details?userid=dn7jf28qOUa_UFZT9EOsQQ,"Webster, NY",7/2/2021,2.0,"Almost an hour for just my latte, still waiting on the food.  They forgot our order, blamed their ticketing system in the back, but supposedly that had nothing to do with the delayed latte.  They brought someone else's food to the table, then brought my latte to someone else. The food finally came, the toast was burnt on the pulled pork Benedict, they only provided a dull butter knife to cut it. The poached eggs were hard boiled. Over all the taste was good, but was an unpleasant experience.  The wait staff kept saying they would check on the latte, wAs told it was being made, but that apparently was someone else's. They were apologetic, but I'm just not sure I believe them.  Will need to buy coffee elsewhere.

From pictures and recent reviews, I expected an outdoor deck with plexi glass and socially distanced tables, but that was not the case. The tables were about 1-2 feet at max from each other, and there were no opened windows, except for the open entrance, which was insufficient. There was plexi glass installed to the tables left and right of you, but not behind you. There was a group of 6 people dining 2 feet behind me with no plexi glass divider. Given how tight and uncomfortably close the tables are, I felt extremely unsafe with the underwhelming COVID-19 precautions taken here and would not recommend anyone coming if they're not comfortable catching COVID. I'm not sure why they didn't have outdoor dining today but would not return until the pandemic eases up.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/hole-in-the-wall-new-york-13?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's in a hotel, but with the lack of tourists in the city, it feels like a local hang.

Everyone should try their truffle fries, OG burger, and shrimp pappardelle. I was blown away with the quality of service I had tonight. After my friend and I signed our checks, I was ready to leave the restaurant when my phone slipped and fell through the crack of the patio. While I was flabbergasted, the staff of the restaurant remained calm and tried everything to get my phone out. They first used a hammer drill and other tools to get my phone out through the crack of the wooden patio. The waitress brought us frozen margaritas as we anxiously waited. It seemed like it was an impossible task without breaking the patio. However, Lisa saved the night. She used cake knives with mastery just like how you would play the Operations game and was able to get my phone out. I was really touched by the amount of care and dedication from every staff-- while it was a stressful situation, they mediated the tension with a sense of humor and kindness.

Lauren H.,/user_details?userid=0tI0qaFmac-76BPviQ3PaQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2/16/2023,4.0,"Went there with a big group for and had a great night. One of the only downsides is they do not sell liquor only wine and Champaign so limited cocktails. We tried a lot of appetizers and  even a couple of mains to start. We tried the Tarte Tatin D'endives, Burrata, grilled Octopus, and then the Mussles and Gnocchi from the mains. Everything was really delicious my favorites were the Gnocchi and Octopus. The Gnocchi was in a delicious creamy sauce and the Gnocchi must of been pan fried as well because it was a little crispy as well which i loved. Octopus is one if my favorite things and this came with a yummy pure, the octopus itself was a little tough but veryy flavorful. For the Main I got the Filet De Boeuf Rossini and it was great! It has a really beautiful presentation and the foie gras was a great compliment to beef when you ate them together. For dessert we tried the apple tart and creme brulee both were delicious. Definitely will be adding this to my go again list.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mino-brasserie-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Mino Brasserie was a perfect dinner spot for a meet up with friends from out of town. The candle-lit dining room and menu of french staples were fitting for the chilly night. We ordered a bottle of Cloudline Pinot Noir, Burrata Des Pouilles, Gnocchi Aux Truffes, Boeuf Bourguignon, Potage de Saison (Potato and Leek Soup), and a side of frites. The highlight was the Boeuf Bourguignon with tender, generous pieces of beef and deep, complex flavors. To finish, we ordered the Mousse Au Chocolat.

Jemima M.,/user_details?userid=qXnYqoNDR3DQ-hcloZ1vrA,"Clarksburg, MD",3/25/2022,5.0,"I've been to multiple French restaurants in the U.S, and I specialize in reviewing them. Mino is not your typical French restaurant. They are not here to just sell the idea of French cuisine to you. They are here to immerse you into it. Their menu is very diverse from the red meat to the white meat. They are excellent at both. They do scallops like you have never seen before. I hate giving 10/10 because a dish is never perfect, but I cannot think of another way it could have been better. So I give their scallops a 10/10. Their poulet suprême (chicken) is not your typical chicken dish. It's an fusion of art and cuisine. By the time you are done with your meal you feel as if your palette has increased. Their lemon tart feels like a childhood memory. You will wonder if they stole your grandma recipe. It's a must every time you go there a 10/10. Presentation is excellent and the interior is splendid. The staff is very welcoming and the chef make sure every plate that goes out is a work of art. Mino is authentic French cuisine it's for the lovers of culinary cuisine that are there for the authenticity of the food and not just the French experience. It's the best French restaurant is NYC right now. I've been to over 30 French restaurant in the U.S, and Mino is my number 1 right now.

Giulio E.,/user_details?userid=NlFGbrXsnVTk_Tam2zJA_g,"Miami, FL",4/23/2022,1.0,"We were really excited to dine here. We made reservations on OpenTable 7 hours in advance. When I called to check in, the person on the phone said it didn't exist. She apologized but reassured me that the reservation was safe when we got there. When we arrived, they assured us the table would be ready in 5-10 minutes. After a couple minutes, the table was clean and ready for us to sit. When we check with them, they said it would take 2 minutes to sit. We waited for at least 5-7 minutes more and during this time we see at least two groups of people who get sat immediately. We check a third time and again, we received the ""it'll take 2 minutes"" response. While we were staring at this people-less, clean table, not one time did they apologize or even look at us. So, after the ""2 minutes"" of no acknowledgement - we took off and ate a fabulous dinner at Cafe Cluny, right around the corner. We got sat in less 3 minutes, no reservations. If you got this far into the review, don't waste your money at Mino, go get some Cafe Cluny - the salmon is wonderful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mino-brasserie-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My bf later told me while we were eating here he chose this place because the guy on Parks and Recs are here. I like this place a lot because their menu changes frequently. We came at 2:30pm and there was no wait. There's a set lunch menu. We also ordered a cheese plate that had the best cheese I've ever tasted, very flavorful and kinda salty but not too cheesy. It came with Branson pickles....SO GOOD. I was irked because a waitress (not ours) insisted on clearing this plate from the table a hurried me to put the rest of the pickles on my last piece of cheese and toast. The baked bean flavor was amazing, sweet and salty, good enough that I ate it and I usually don't like baked beans. The cabbage was okay. I didn't like the cheese that came with it, but I don't normally like cheese. The crunchy red things on top were good. The cabbage tasted very raw and fresh and crunchy. Okay I did not know that ""Nashville hot"" meant spicy. I thought it meant it was popular in Nashville. So disclosure: THE SANDWICH IS REALLY SPICY! I took one bite and was dying but my normal spice tolerance is like a medium spicy. I ended performing microsurgery on the chicken and took off all the skin and then it was a tolerable sandwich. There was no stars or peppers on the menu to indicate that it was spicy. All that being said, I would come back again because a lot of people like this place and the menu changes very often.

The best thing about this place was the $7 bread, and it was only worth $5. I've never seen yuzu tuna be so butchered to the point that it tastes like tea leaves rather than yuzu, or tuna. My date just turned 25 and it triggered a quarter life crisis. And I paid for the privilege with the standard 50% Williamsburg markup, followed by an additional 'this place is owned by a famous person' 50% markup. The only redeeming part of this was the waiter, who had a penchant for calling us ""gang"" and ""friend"" (which was at least mildly entertaining)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-four-horsemen-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The dining room and bar have an intimate feeling with dim lighting and upscale decor but still relaxed. Our server was really kind and accessible but really let us enjoy a long meal by bringing out our dishes with nice timing. I particularly love wine bars and small plates to share, so the menu was up my alley. We opted for the bread which was so delicious with homemade butter. We shared the yellow fin tuna, beef ribs, and rigatoni bolognese. Every dish had great attention to detail and were ""melt in your mouth"" good. We opted on a bottle of white wine from their short menu, but they have an extensive menu if you are well versed in wines. We even saved the bottle as a momento because it was such a memorable meal.

Luis C.,/user_details?userid=5A6gFWXGEvVpmCupKXlBNA,"Queens, NY",8/10/2016,2.0,"So, I heard a lot of good things about this place so I decided to check it out with a friend. Saw the menu on Yelp and got excited. So we get there, the place is very nice and cozy. The staff there was on point, our server was great, friendly and offered us a few suggestions. When I saw the menu I was disappointed to see only 2 main entrees which were a pork chop and I think some fish dish that started with a t. So much for that steak I saw in the Yelp pics and wanted to try. We ordered a few starters, the beef tartare, clams, and the yellow fish crudo, and we decided to share the pork chop dish for our entree. I gotta say I eat out a lot and love places like the Spotted Pig, Lartusi, and the Breslin in the city. This unfortunately was not the same experience as my faves. The tartare was on the dry side, and only came with minimal sesame crackers to scoop it up, halfway through we just scooped it up with a fork. The yellowfin crudo was tasty but nothing really special to make it terrific. The clams had some type of sausage in it, but I really didn't care for the smokiness flavor of the whole dish. The biggest disappointment was the main pork chop dish. You figure for $36 the portion would be pretty significant for a pork dish. It wasn't at all! We had about 5 slices of pork garnished with a very tasty kale (best part). We came in not that hungry, but we didn't leave this place satisfied. For $180 and 4 beverages between the 2 of us this was very pricey and unfilling. I never mind spending good money on food but when you leave a place disappointed with taste and not even close to full it's just not worth it. Again the service was terrific, everything else though was just mediocre.

Malissa M.,/user_details?userid=9-MwNkW45BocB179LPO8gg,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",8/17/2016,3.0,"First let me say that I really liked this restaurant the first couple of months it was open. The wine and the portion size was perfect. Everything was good. The last couple of times I went hasn't been so good. We waited about 15 min for a waitress to come to our table and almost an hour and a half food to come out. I honestly felt bad for the staff (I've been in their shoes) they were very understaffed which was probably the reason the wait was so long. Only two cooks and what seemed like one waitress (possibly two) for a full restaurant. There are some great dishes that are worth the money and some that aren't. For example the tuna tartar and the cheeses are some of my favorite things and the price is right. Having said that its kind of ridiculous  the amount of money they charge for a side dish portion of the pasta entree. 20 dollars is a little too much for such a small portion. The only other entree option is $35. Second avoid the $6 bread and butter. Just because the butter is ""cultured"" doesn't take away from the fact that it's literally bread and butter which you usually get for free. Other then that this is a nice restaurant to take a nice date and to sip on some nice wine while you talk about how much you hate republicans and tell your friend that you've decided become ""gluten free"".",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-four-horsemen-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We went back to check about 25 minutes after that and another hostess had said that they had given our table away and that they wanted to call us but couldn't.. You know why? BECAUSE THEY NEVER ASKED US FOR A CONTACT NUMBER TO CALL US. The second hostess was definitely worse than the first one. Her attitude was horrible. I will never go back to this place.

He took us on a journey through France and helped us discover some great wine regions of France. One of highlights was a Gamay from Loire Valley (Vin Rouge) which blew us away. The meal was just as good. We shared some cheese (robiola bosina with a great tomato jam and bianco sardo) both different and tasty. You have to get the bread! It might have been the highlight of the meal, and not because everything else was not great but because the bread was that amazing! We also shared the snap pea salad and beef tartare.

I quickly removed my plate and told the server and had them take back the salad to the kitchen. I waited expecting a manager and or the chef to quickly rectify the situation but instead was ignored. 5 mins later they asked us would you like to order anything else assuming they would offer something on the house - with that assumption I didn't want to take a chance on ordering another meal, instead ordered another bottle of Sancerre. I didn't want to dampen my experience so I carried on with dinner hoping to enjoy the rest. When we got the bill - they only took out the salad and the cake cutting fee from the check! (cake was for friends birthday). My friends and I were shocked! We assumed something would have been on the house and a apology should have been warranted. I complained to the manager and she wasn't being understanding and sympathetic to the situation. She said - it looks like you were enjoying yourselves.

I left off one star only because I think it's a bit pricey for what you get, and they brought all the food out at once. I went for their prix fixe, weekend lunch. Actually, it's just a set menu for one price - $28. I got 3 courses and a tiny piece of bread. It was just enough food for me! If you have a bigger appetite, and most ppl do, compared to me, it might not be enough. But it was perfect for me and every dish was delicious! The little roll was rock hard, though...but the butter was great and it was only the bread! I honestly can't recall everything about each course (a few days ago), but there was a lovely polenta, a super fresh tomato salad and the main dish was fish (I can't recall anything about the fish, but I know it was delicious!). The wines - all natural - are why I came. It's hard to fine natural wines outside of Williamsburg. They had a small, but impressive selection. I couldn't decide between 2 of their sparklings, so my server kindly let me order 2, half glasses of each. She was knowledgeable of the wines and helped me choose a glass with my lunch. I don't mind paying a little more for nice wine, but I felt that for the pours I received, the prices were just too steep. They have a selection of prices, from $13-$18 (probably higher, but that was as high as I would consider), but I wish they had a few that were more affordable, as most are going to want to dry more than one! And while the lunch was a good price, there were no other happy hour specials or anything. And, again, they brought all the food out at once, so it got cold and wasn't as tasty. There are at least 2 other, natural wine bars in the area that I will try & compare. I know at least one has a happy hour that we will try.

Stephan P.,/user_details?userid=EKttejDnVX9vrJlNBBSWpg,"Brooklyn, NY",9/24/2015,3.0,"It's amazing how easy it is for the new breed of ""Williamsburgers"" to accept this sort of restaurant. Our party of five had quite a few items from the menu and the consensus was that for the prices and portions, this is a rip-off. The bread that every review is raving about is $6 to start with (aka two loaves of amazing seeded rye bread at the Polish bakery on N 8th). We got two (yes, two) end pieces. Yes, it was warm and pretty good, but two crusty pieces for $6? We bought it up with the waitress a couple of times, and she kept saying she'll check with the kitchen, or go ""smile"" at the chef to get more, but we never received another proper slice. How easy would it have been for the restaurant to satisfy their ""difficult"" customers who are asking for another slice of bread to go with two small, crusty pieces for $6?!!! The rock shrimp pasta was overcooked and watery; the sunchokes were rubbery; the $10 patatas bravas were bland; the overpriced tuna dish tasted like day-old goulash--sush an unfair treatment for a delicate fish. On the bright side, the bacalao toast was yummy and the beet salad was fresh and well-seasoned. The wine selection is impressive and not as ridiculously priced as the food. My advice: if you want to check this place out, go to the bar, enjoy a glass or a bottle of delicious natural wine and maybe have one snack before heading somewhere nearby (St. Mazie, Bozu, Dokebi, Caracas, etc etc) for dinner that won't leave a bad taste in your mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-four-horsemen-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

ada b.,/user_details?userid=tkcqu5zC5lFXBRxLfm0wWQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/30/2017,2.0,"Skip it! Not a lovely place or vibe at all. Came for a glass of wine with a girlfriend, around 10 pm week night. The bar was not crowded, nor was the restaurant, rest of space. The woman behind the bar was not at all gracious, no hello, greeting, smile, or a nod of acknowledgement, just a stink face. The decor and vibe of the place immediately strikes one as cold and minimal, and foreshadowed our experience- slick and icy. First thing that happens is that the bartender is half-yelling at the one waitress, and is clearly annoyed about a bottle of wine that was mistakenly opened. Uncomfortable to be privy to this, and you would think she would be embarrassed or apologize for her vibe kill to customers, but no. She says out loud to no one in particular, ""does anyone want to order this wine now that was just opened?!"" My friend offers sheepishly, ""Well, maybe I'll taste it?"", as she starts to pour, my friend offers, ""Just a taste please"", The bartender snaps back, ""I think I know what I'm doing."" Well then. The wine was not to her taste, and she asks then if they serve coffee or tea. First the bartender, jaw dropped, rudely exclaims ""you're not drinking!?"" I add quickly that I'd be having wine but my friend wants to switch to something non-alcoholic if possible. Bartender is clearly annoyed, and then says, ""we could do a tea"", ""great"", my friend says, ""do you have mint?"" The bartender then says she can't find mint but she has another tea. OK, my friend says, as long as it's herbal. I order a white wine. My wine was quite nice, but for $15 I should hope it would be, however her grumpy, verging on nasty demeanor were so off putting, it was frankly hard to enjoy. We tried to shrug it off, and chalk it to a tired, slightly unkempt bartender lady who was having a bad night. Of note, the place had plenty of empty seats, so it's not like we were coming at dinner time or into a packed bar and taking up two bar seats, as one (shocker!) non alcohol consuming customer. We did not feel welcome or enchanted by the place, and especially not by the frazzled bartender woman, so we soon asked for our check. My wine, though lovely tasting, I left unfinished. Got the check, and we thought there was a mistake- one item for 15, the other for 11. I said, ""Pardon me, I'm not sure if this is our bill, she just had a tea."" ""That's your bill! With the tea!"", snappy said. We paid up, tipped. End of story. Eleven dollars for tea folks! This is not the Waldorf Astoria! It's grubby yuppie Williamsburg. And the bartender woman has clearly been in the bar business too long and resents what she does. Hospitality , nope. Also of note, though the place has a long by the bottle wine list, they offer very few wines by the glass, and the prices are high end by the glass prices. I find so few wines offered by the glass hardly make it a wine bar (which they advertise themselves to be). Takeaway- Did we take this personally? No. She wasn't nice to anyone really.  If you go- Don't order tea or sit at the bar ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-four-horsemen-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The waitress came over and told us there were two special dishes tonight, one is lamb shoulder, the other one is whole Branzino fish. Sounds great. So we took the advice and ordered both (we have 3 ladies in total) without asking the price. We also ordered a mushroom dish which tasted fantastic.

From the food to the cocktails to the decor to the service to the atmosphere, you leave the streets of Manhattan and are on the Mediterranean coast. Chef Andres has created a menu that relies primarily on Greek and Lebanese flavors, but is quintessentially Mediterranean. The Santorini Octopus might be the best octopus dish in New York (sorry Milos). On the ground floor of the new Ritz Carlton Nomad, Zaytinya is already a huge success. The dishes are all mezze-style and good to share so you can taste a lot.

The restaurant is gorgeous. It's dim lit and beautiful. The bar and walls are stunning. Their seating arrangement is packed tho. It's not fat people friendly. The seating is so tight that when we were served flatbread, a lady taking her seat at the table next to me accidentally brushed her purse over it. Service people didn't come by frequently enough to replace it. As for the food food... I don't know. I have paid way less for a fuller meal made from fresh ingredients at other Turkish places. The portions are tiny here and not even executed great. Everything tasted over cooked. The Adana kebab, what ever rice dish I got, and eggplant appetizer was just eh. If you want to feel special about going to an upscale looking place, this might be worth checking out? Cocktails were expensive (about $20) and my date was muslim so we did not drink. I've paid a lot for fancy cocktails so I wonder if the experience would have been worth it if I had a bit of alcohol in my system. I really really wanted to like this place but I paid for food and was not happy. Oh.

The rice with fried shallots hearty & tasty. The meatballs tomato sauce is herb infused and cut with feta. The lamb shank was filling, but the portion was the right size.

Anyway, let's begin.  We ordered a soujouk pide and the soujouk was nonexistent; okay maybe a couple paper thin truffle like slices of sausage.  Our artisanal cheese pikilia/assortment was basically 3 or four bite sized pieces of cheese. The cauliflower was bland and uncooked.  Everything else we had: falafel, octopus, lamb baharat, shrimp and soutzoukakia were generally pretty good but tiny.  Look, I'm basically listing off the entire menu and my party of two relatively thin people left this place hungry. Lastly, I totally understand that they want to elevate the galaktobouriko but it should still have some semblance of a galaktobouriko; and btw mastiha should be served freezing cold ideally in a frozen glass.  It is not raki to be diluted/cooled with ice (no need for three glasses).  To end on a high note, the Mediterranean G&Ts were definitely on point.  I really very much wanna like this place, and I may be back for a G&T, but it could be so much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/zaytinya-new-york-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

When the server finally came, he attempted to take our water order. I guess they don't talk? When we ordered, the server forgot my soup. When I got it, it was cold and I had to wait for a spoon.

Max M.,/user_details?userid=TpYlEdya1FlT5LG5nfASlQ,"Boston, MA",9/8/2022,1.0,"After much fanfare, I decided to take my girlfriend here for her birthday. The hostess was gracious and accommodating, as we showed up a few minutes late. Once we were seated, it took a very long time for anyone to come for water or drink orders. This theme permeated throughout the rest of the night, even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The food was slow and uninspiring. At the end of the meal, the waiter did not ask if we wanted another drink or dessert. I had indicated when I made the reservation through their portal that we were celebrating a birthday, and nothing was done to acknowledge that. No one refilled our water the entire meal. No one checked to see how the food was. No one said thanks when we paid or left. Price aside, I would not recommend this restaurant at all. Very disappointed and will never return. I expect a lot more from a Jose Andres establishment and hope they fix these issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/zaytinya-new-york-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Loved that we stayed at the ritz and they had this option however we quickly learned this is just highly unfortunate to be a ritz restaurant. Food was ok/decent. But definitely not what expected for this restaurant. Waitress was gone over 15-20 minutes before we even made a drink order. Our party of four was ready to order at least 2-4 bottles of wine and she couldn't make any recommendations and said she would ""go ask the bartender for recommendations"" then was gone another 15 minutes. She proceed to come back with options for us to try but were not available for bottle purchase- therefore why are we trying them? It ended up being such an awkward experience. She also could not give food recommendations. While this place has good potential it was terrible for our anniversary and one time we had in NYC and chose to spend it here. Go else where. I am generous with this rating as food was simply ok.

Angela W.,/user_details?userid=gS2ApQ039FJx-Yd-F5nw9A,"Livingston, NJ",2/27/2023,4.0,"After trying to get a reservation at Shukette for months, my sister and I finally managed to snag a reservation for 4. We ordered Frena, Labneh, and Roasted Cauliflower to start, and the Steak Shish Kebab and Fish in a Cage as entrees. The Frena was amazing - I highly recommend this dish. It was soaked in olive oil and a little crispy on the bottom. There were also roasted garlic cloves on top that were great. The Frena was very small for $8, so we decided to order a Lafa as well which was also very good. The Lafa is more of a flatbread type of bread. The Labneh was good as well, but a little cream cheese-like. The Roasted Cauliflower dish was also very good, but overpriced at $16 for around 6-7 pieces of cauliflower. For the entrees, the Steak Shish Kebab was really juicy and tender, but there were only 5 pieces of steak on it. For $26, I didn't think that was worth it. The Fish in a Cage ($36) was very good. It was a whole crispy fish with two delicious sauces. The fish was probably the most worth it. To end the meal, we shared the Tahini Soft Serve. It was great with the halva floss and hazelnut, but I didn't like the tart syrup they used on top - I believe it was pomegranate. Overall, Shukette has some amazing dishes, but the portions are way too small for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shukette-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However, our experience at Shukette was clouded by the slow, inconsistent and unprofessional service. We were a group of four, we had a reservation for 9:45. The restaurant had other customers but did not seem to be overly busy. Once placing our order we didn't receive 3 of the dishes that we ordered. For the dips that we received, the breads that we ordered with them did not come out at the same time, making it hard to eat. When we mentioned to our waitress that we hadn't received many of our dishes still, she seemed surprised and sent a man over ( can only assume was a manager) who just said "" I hear we didn't get our lentils here, I will send over an extra pita bread."" After all this, we still did not end up receiving 3 dishes that we ordered. At the end of the night when we were ready for our check, we told the waitress that we never received these dishes despite a manager already trying to reconcile this. She told us "" I'm going to go crush some skulls "" and made her way to the kitchen. A lady who we assume was another manager came over and profusely apologized, offered her business card and ended up comping less than a quarter of our bill of the items we did receive. Overall really poor service and unprofessional. We will probably not be returning with all the wonderful other options in nyc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shukette-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sophia L.,/user_details?userid=tslpUxqWKwk6dKvNNZ4hTw,"University City, Philadelphia, PA",2/21/2023,5.0,"I've been wanting to try this place for so long and it surely does not disappoint - so good that I secured my next reservation right after. First of all, the bread, oh the famous Frena bread, it tastes like a buttery fluffy cloud. Words can't describe how good it is. The hummus, as the name goes, is surely ""not your average"", and it compliments the bread so well.  Next we got the grilled shrimp because the lady sitting next to us had it and it smelled way too tempting. Obviously no regrets, it was a little spicy, which was unexpected but wasn't overpowering. The portion was a little small though but it was shrimp so understandable. I think next time I'll try the fish in a cage. We also got a citrus salad, was pretty good but personally it felt more like a dessert rather than a salad. Overall the portions were not big, kind of like tapas, which is great since you can try a variety although it may end up a little expensive. The bread was definitely fairly priced though and I would come back a hundred times just for that. The ambience was pretty cool, open kitchen concept and you can see the magic happening right in front of you, but it did get a little smoky, which I personally didn't mind. Overall, this place was worth the hype and I can't wait to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shukette-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

First visit, we came with a group of three and got the labneh, hummus, zaalouk (eggplant), jobneh (essentially string cheese), frena, lafa, gozleme, kibbeh, feta-toush, jeweled rice, fish in a cage, and the tahini soft serve for dessert. We loved just about everything. The labneh came with amazingly crispy fried squash blossoms, and I couldn't come and not get that. I loved all of the other mezzes and breads as well (the zaalouk and frena were probably my other favorites from those groups), although my wife didn't love the herbiness in the gozleme.

If you like Mediterranean flavors then this is your new favorite restaurant. My wife was able to book a last-minute reservation here for our wedding anniversary. The menu is intense, so don't fret - just ask the waitstaff and they will guide you through with their recommendations. Our waitress recommended Labneh from the dip section and the Frena from the bread section. They paired brilliantly well together and we will make an effort to try the rest of their dips and breads during subsequent visits. The Labneh was a beautifully put together yogurt based dip, and we learned that Chef Ayesha Nurdjaja prepares the yogurt fresh in-house from scratch. The Frena was similar to the Focaccia from Ci Siamo, wonderfully rich with a great depth of flavor. The Roasted Delicata Squash was a great appetizer and went beautifully with the tahini. Unfortunately, after this point in the meal I was regrettably full from overdoing it with the Frena and Labneh and was reaching the end of my capacity. The Tuna Meatballs was delicious; however, the Jeweled Rice was the star of the show and will stun your senses, the aroma is incredible. The Kebab plates are filling, but definitely a must-get item.

And that's not even mentioning the outstanding food. We visited with reservations on a recent Saturday night, and the buzzy atmosphere, beautiful interior, and kitschy, playful decor were immediately infectious. After being seated at perfect, romantically-lit sidewalk table, we dug into their equally as playful and diverse menu, featuring far beyond the usual hummus and pita (although they do that exquisitely, too). After starting with wine, we made some painstaking decisions given the many, tempting options. We started fresh with the hummus, pickles, and fattoush, and followed that up with the crispy fried squash blossoms and shawarma fries. However, the standout at Shukette is the bread. While the khachapuri is delicious, the puffy and garlicky frena is outstanding and the best thing on the menu (or any menu). We ended with their eccentric but absolutely tasty tehina ice cream sundae, a subtle and nutty end to our meal.

Marisa L.,/user_details?userid=mJbSn-Av4gnux0QkvE5uVg,"Brooklyn, NY",8/26/2021,5.0,I am a regular at Shuka so I was really excited to finally check this place out. It is such a cool spin off with a totally different vibe similarly inspired menus but definitely new fun and different things. I sat at the bar and was able to see all of the delicious dishes being brought out and that help me decide what to get. Some of my favorites were the tuna meatballs. I don't even love tuna and I really didn't think they could be good in this form but they were so tasty and delicious with some cilantro type of flavor going on very small and really satisfying. I also liked the lamb kibbeh which I don't usually like but it wasn't greasy at all.  The heirloom salad had a slightly different spin from the one I have had before and had such an amazing light dressing on it that matched perfectly with the sesame seeds. Overall I really liked the use of sesame seeds in a lot of these dishes. I also tried the cheese that was like mozzarella and it was amazing and I learned that it was made in house. Not surprisingly everything was super fresh and service was right on point. I really enjoyed my cucumber spritz and they had some delicious cava on the menu as well. I had to end my meal with the tahini soft serve and it was totally worth it. I can't believe how delicious something could taste that doesn't even have dairy. I will definitely be back!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shukette-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The NY steak was also bland and had to rely on the garlic dip for flavor which was also ordered separately.

The eggplant too was marvelous, sweet yet spicy and crispy so so good. For a main we got the fish in the cage which is always good and great to share.

The fried squash blossoms on the labneh and the flavors of the fattoush were great, the flavor profiles of the rest was just okay. The garden gazoz was refreshing but unmemorable.

The decor and vibe are upbeat and fun.  The staff is welcoming and warm. The service is friendly, prompt and efficient without being overwhelming.  The food is so colorful and flavorful and keeps you wanting more.  The dishes are unique and each dish is its own masterpiece.   I love a good cocktail and Gazoz are fun wine spritzers with fresh fruits and herbs. It's like getting a bouquet of flowers!  Everything is fresh!  All the dips are delicious, the hummus is as smooth as silk, the play on baba ghanoush using zucchini is brilliant. The labneh is my favorite served with squash blossoms.  The saltcod is something I wouldn't normally order but everything was so delicious I had to try it and it is probably one of my favorite things on the menu. The squid kebab is amazing.  The lamb gyro is authentic and the fries are cooked to perfection. The fish in a cage is last meal level, perfectly cooked and boneless served with fresh grilled veggies.  You could make a meal alone of the different kinds of house made breads.  The frena is absolute perfection!  And last but certainly not least, as named on the menu as the mic drop and it really is, is the tahini soft serve with halva floss.

Jay V.,/user_details?userid=QEkqOMa5iSAguiyhj7WsHA,"Jersey City, NJ",2/11/2023,3.0,"Recette came highly recommended on Yelp and I expected better. This is a French cafe with very basic fare. What really threw me off was their ""brunch menu"" which essentially picked up items from their regular lunch menu and added $3-$5 per item. So strange and so quintessentially Williamsburg. Fundamentally they are marking up a regular menu for a weekend. I wouldn't spend money here when there are several much more impressive dine-in options around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/recette-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My gfs had shared a wine bottle.  The octopus was great, however, I didn't like how they cut up the tentacles in small pieces, making it a little chewy, flavor was there, but they should keep that octopus whole, keeping it tender.  The escargot was good, not chewy at all, buttery.  I didn't try the French onion soup but my friend really liked it. For our entrees we had the wild mushroom truffle, that was absolutely divine! Creamy, truffle, goodness.  My favorite thing on the menu.  Beef bourginon was tender, and oh so flavorful, that meat was so super soft.  The mashed potatoes it came with, was extra creamy and absolutely delicious, I liked that they had the mashed on the side so you can be in control of how much sauce was going in there.  Steak frites was good, not the best, but nonetheless yummy. The French fries were super crispy and we loved it so much.  For dessert, we received panacotta on the house.  I've never had panacotta, but this was pretty damn good. The berries were fresh, and the panacotta so jiggly. *chefs kiss* Would definitely be back to try more on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/recette-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The crème brulee was a little off because mine didn't have the best brulee and didn't have that resounding cracking sound but the crème was good.

Music is eclectic and fun, not mainstream and sets a friendly vibe. just enough on the menu to give you options but not enough to overwhelm. It also gives me the impression that the menu choices they do have, they're impeccable at..It seems like it's a male dominated stuff, and they're all very friendly and good looking ;)  The food is fresh, I didn't have any residual icky feelings/lethargy even after eating the non-veggie options. Theyre not super gluten friendly, but most things can be modified to any gluten sensitivities. The vegetarian options look simple and satisfying. The burrata salad is addicting and even the omelette was great considering it was just a regular omelette, French styled of course. The DRINKS though, cocktails are simply perfect. I like to stick to neat drinks at this point but with their signature cocktail menu I just had to try. Also tried the branzino (on a dif occasion, no pics) and it was well worth it. Haven't gotten around to trying the dessert yet. Perfect for a solo time or group gathering for an upscale casual time.

They were a bit soggy and there wasn't much chorizo which was disappointing, but the flavor was still pretty good. The service was very quick and everyone was so kind so it was a pleasant experience on that front. Biggest turn off was that the place was packed and there wasn't enough seating.

If you like the batter where it's really thick, this is the place for you.  The shrimp and chicken was tender and not overcooked.  They make the items right in front of you, so they probably don't around sit around too long to get chewy. The dirty fries #2 had good flavor but was a bit too salty. The regular fries were seasoned perfectly.  If you're looking for a value meal, this isn't it, I spent around $48 for these 2 combos.

I ordered the Fish and Shrimp Combo which came with fries (aka chips). My husband ordered the Shrimp which came with fries (aka chips). We also shared the Sticky Toffee Shake and the Dirty Chips #1 which were the fries topped with Jalapeño, Chorizo, Cotija Cheese, Red Onion, Chives, Parsley. Between both of us for dips we tried the Gordon's Tartar, Curry & Mango, Southwest Ranch and Dijon Mayonnaise. We loved the food, the drink was super rich and thick. I loved all the decor in the place, and it was also super clean which is always good. It is a bit pricy but it's Times Square and Gordon Ramsey. All meals are made to order and are served super hot!

The shrimp combo has 5 large shrimps and fries. The dishes were deep fried and not very flavorful but they offer a good half dozens dipping sauces. Trying the dips were an adventure on its own. Aiello, tartar, Dijon, mango, to name a few.  The shop makes all the items when you order them. There is a wait for your food if the place is crowded.  My favorite thing was the shake!  Biscotti shake?   It was flavorful and hit the spot while waiting for your order. They is ample seating.

She said that her and her son enjoyed their meals, so before going to the movies, we decided to go. Apple Maps has the wrong address so I had to call--an employee told me the correct address but said that they were having technical issues and wouldn't be open for another 10 minutes (we were going to get there for 5pm). This worked out for us because there was no line and we were able to pick our seats. You just grab a table that's available. When you walk in, you place your order with the cashier and you are given your receipt with order number. Once the order is ready, they announce the order number. Since my friend ordered the fish and chips when she dined here before, she tried the shrimp and chips with sriracha aioli and tartar sauce. I got the fish and chips with the same dipping sauces. We definitely enjoyed our meals and we washed it down with lemonade. The meals are made to order and you can see they preparing the meals (flouring and everything). No heat lamps over here! You can get the fries loaded but I thought regular fries or should I say, chips, were good. We both could taste peach in the lemonade--it was really tasty.

Leslie O.,/user_details?userid=_SNubiaSBMb5dLb2hKk9mg,"New York, NY",1/29/2023,4.0,"Fish and Chips was a childhood favorite of mine--mainly Arthur Treacher's , so when Ramsay's shop opened I knew we had to try.  One night on the way to Town Hall we stepped in for a quick pre-show meal.  A small-ish fast casual restaurant space was very crowded with multiple people standing to wait for their orders.  Counter staff and fry staff were very efficient and quick and friendly.  Our meal took about 10 minutes during which time we finally found a seat.  The fish was very very hot and extremely crisply fried.  In other words a 9 out of 10.  It was a little greasy but that's somewhat to be expected. Chips were more American style fries rather than thicker Brit cuts.   2 sauces came with your order--I opted for standard tartar and a smoky ranch that was tasty.   Portions were generous. A small beverage selection and 2 shakes options (not sure they go with Fish and Chips but looked very tasty so I'll be back for one as dessert one day).  One slight negative--the garbage area kept getting filled up with the cardboard boxes the meals are served in and made for a sloppy view.  Staff was quick to clear that area but maybe a redesign is in order to not show so much trash toppling over.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gordon-ramsay-fish-and-chips-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

A bit surprising that it wasn't better given Ramsay's penchant for tearing apart restaurant operators. Fish and shrimp (we tried both) were crisp and well-battered on the outside in the classic English style, but the inside was a bit mushy (and who ever heard of mushy shrimp? -- I suspect a frozen product was used). The ""chips"" were basic American-style fries, more or less, and nothing special. Dipping sauces were excellent, however. The biggest issue? We had to wait more than 20 minutes for our order -- not exactly what you expect in a ""fast"" casual restaurant. And the place was a bit messy, though we arrived at a busy time and perhaps staff couldn't keep up with cleaning (still, it's the kind of detail that would drive Ramsay mad). It's a nice pre-theater option to have in Times Square, but I wouldn't rush back.

Joshua E.,/user_details?userid=dwlsG4RiIbgzb8xboXk0LA,"Queens, NY",12/3/2018,3.0,I REALLY wanted to love this place but there were a few glaring issues. First of all I ordered pickup and requested 5:30; they called to confirm and while I asked for a little earlier they said they could only do 5:30 so I agreed. Basically I didnt walk out of there until about 5:50 which was really annoying. They were somewhat apologetic but they weren't really rushing at all. In addition they could have thrown something in to show that they were apologetic but alas nothing. I also asked them to make sure the order was right and of course when I got home and opened it up they got an order wrong which should have been porkbelly but was another chicken. Regarding the food I don't know if the chicken wouldve been crispy if you order at the restaurant but when I got home the chickens was marginally crispy and the flavor wasn't anything special. I love their menu choices but none of it was really awesome. I doubt I would come back but hope they can fix up their dishes and service. Try out their online ordering for 20% off.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ichibantei-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The entree also comes with a bowl of miso soup (really good but was a bit too salty) and a salad (very fresh and the dressing was pretty good). The nanban itself was not bad, but for me it lacked a bit flavor and the chicken was a bit soggy. I think this place definitely has potential though. Maybe their ramen is better?

My friend orders something and then changes her mind shortly after to downsize it from large to medium. The guy comes out with the large AND a medium and then tells us then that it's too late. My friend tries to clarify that she said she downsized it. How you about to scam us by giving us TWO orders of a large AND medium when she clearly said she just wanted one order for herself?! The worker continues to give some attitude with a b***h face saying too bad it's too late it came out. We're like ok we get it.

Caleb B.,/user_details?userid=vxQGVo8SaDyu7QWBFH6rDQ,"San Antonio, TX",1/27/2021,1.0,"I LOVE Japanese food, and frequently cook it at home so I was excited to try this place since it's so close. Usually when my boyfriend and I go to an expensive NY restaurant for the first time we share a plate since they range from $15-$25 per plate and the check can go up to the $60s for a lunch. When we stopped in here we were going to try the wagyu, and when were about to be seated in the empty booth section, the waiter told us we had to order an entree for each of us if we wanted to eat there. I understand covid precautions, but I have never been to a restaurant that forces you to individually buy plates unless it was a buffet (understandably). I'm disappointed that during a pandemic when everyone is low on cash, and restaurants are already struggling, this restaurant forces you to have your own $15-$25 plate of food just to eat there. I won't be going there anytime soon, but may one day I'll check back to see if they changed their policy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ichibantei-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The breakfast menu offered eggs in many ways including in a breakfast burrito, wrapped just like a burrito at your fave Mex place. A robust slice of multigrain bread came with my classic breakfast special and the potatoes it came with/ they serve are bite size hashbrowns. A couple of unique side items: the matcha coffee cake is a must try, it was warm, rich green, just the right amount of sweet. The pickled cabbage is also available on the side and came on a nicely stacked chicken sandwich the Birthday girl enjoyed; notably that bread fit for the club sandwich, thin layers. Credit to the service; this place is busy and they work it assuring any allergy accommodations as well. It is a cozy place maybe 10 tables inside in a row. Make reservations! The outside, seating looked nice as the sun was shining on them, and also steadily full, albeit you might need ear plugs as this part of New York carries the sound burden from the transit bridges overhead. Since it is Chinatown, on nearby, Broadway, directly under the bridges, the local street, vendors, were selling a host of interesting items but I couldn't tell you what they were & could not hear the vendor's explanation.

It took a while, but the stars finally aligned and we finally made it to over to try Golden Diner. Let me just say that the honey butter pancakes with fruit compote are amazing and rank up there among my favorite pancakes of all time (along with Clinton St.; the crispy edge pancakes at Over Easy in Kailua, HI; and Norm's in Los Angeles... ). Golden Diner's honey butter pancakes are incredibly fluffy and tender. The honey butter was absolutely delicious and the fruit compote was wonderful--neither the honey butter nor the fruit compote were too sweet and the flavors of both worked really well together. Husband and I split the pancakes and a Chinatown egg sando with sausage. The eggs in the sandwich were cooked perfectly--light and tender. The sausage, hash browns, the scallion bun were all delicious. Husband even gave the standard drip coffee high marks. Struck up a conversation with the couple next to us who raved about their house made granola and were throughly enjoying some gorgeous avocado toast. The place is tiny and the tables are ""New York close,"" but they also had heated outdoor tables available for those who might feel more comfortable with a little more elbow room. As we were leaving we had a chance to meet the owner, Sam. Though he was busy during the morning rush, he took the time to say good morning and thank us for stopping in.

I mean honey butter pancakes? How can those not be divine? I got here at 9:55am on Sunday morning. They open at 10am and there were already 4 other parties waiting for it to open! By the time I left, there was about a 30 minute wait. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. I sat outside because it was a beautiful day. My waitress came over super quickly. I started with a black coffee. They are really good about coming over to pour you more as well throughout the meal, so I always had a full, hot cup! I obviously ordered the honey butter pancakes and a side of bacon. Oh ma goodness. My mouth is still watering from the deliciousness that was this meal. The pancakes were SO fluffy and so tasty. They were drenched in the perfect about of syrup and topped with berries compote (optional but highly suggest) and the most amazing honey butter. I want some of that honey butter just to bring home on it's own. The bacon was also so good. Not sure what they do to it but it just hit different. There were so many other things I wanted to try (the breakfast sandwich, the breakfast burrito)... but guess I'll just HAVE to come back! The wait staff was so kind and attentive.

You can also go more to the Korean end of the spectrum and get the current seasonal special bibimguksu, which is actually spicy on the Korean scale.

Sun-filled and welcoming, we had a delicious lunch on a Wednesday afternoon: vegan Caesar salad, Galangal avocado toast, and a special, the spring bibimbap. I usually roll my eyes at the mention of avocado toast. You're charging me how much to slice open a fruit and squash it on a piece of bread? But this was a thing of beauty, as well as super flavorful, with lots of layers bursting in your mouth: kaffir lime, galangal, fried onion, pickled radish, scallion. The Caesar was refreshing and I had to fight my dining partner over the decadent croutons. One of the standouts to me was the matcha green tea coffee cake: so subtle yet so complex.

(I passed by it when I was driving) The price point is reasonable and service is very good. I had the salmon poke and the king crab poke. It's good but not the best I had. The fish is fresh and they give a descent amount of fish and rice. They give a very small amount of avocado and you do not  pick out everything in your bowl.

Orange P.,/user_details?userid=SgEGkPBNTBJ2yVn8fBjDLA,"New York, NY",1/14/2017,4.0,The poke here taste very fresh. It's not an assembly line like most places. You order at the counter and wait about ten minutes and you get a fresh bowl of poke. I tried the octopus and the ahi tuna. Both are good and well seasoned. Prices are also reasonable. The ahi tuna does appear to be seared tho. And the bowl is filling.

We walked in around 2:15, and were treated to delectable Poke that makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  We tried both the ahi tuna and spicy tuna, one with fried wonton wrappers and the other with sesame seeds over a bed of warm brown rice.

Amanda L.,/user_details?userid=jgXnw_GJoVXT9eiP-_W1Qw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/10/2016,3.0,"With all the poke spots that have been popping up in NYC, I'm really glad one made it to the Lower East Side. Their bowls are very reasonably priced, around $10-14 for a filling meal. Service was quick and staff was friendly too. My boyfriend got the salmon bowl and I had the ahi tuna. We both enjoyed our bowls, but I do wish there were more than 3 slices of tuna in my bowl, especially compared to the mound of salmon cubes in his bowl. The tuna itself was seared well, but it was drowning in the aioli and I had to scrape it off in order to taste the fish. In addition, their bowls are preset and not customizable, so it was kind of frustrating because it came with ingredients I don't really like, such as beets, oshinko, and ginger. I think I would've liked my bowl a lot better if I could've customized it, like at other poke spots. Overall, you get value for your money here, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/simple-nyc-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The shop is small, but bright and clean. When I arrived the place was packed and there was hardly any room to move. But by the time my order was ready, it had cleared out a little and I was able to sit. I ordered the standard ahi poke on quinoa, because I liked that they had more than just your standard rice offering. Unfortunately I wasn't really a fan of the dish overall. The ahi tuna wasn't raw, it looked like it had maybe been seared first, and it was cut into big slices instead of the little chunks I typically prefer. But what killed it for me was the sauce. It was mayo-based and way too heavy/oily for what should be a light dish. I just wasn't really a fan. For what it's worth, the presentation was really nice though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/simple-nyc-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You can eat in (it's very small, maybe 10 seats) or take it to go (there are parks nearby). We brought ours all the way back to Brooklyn and they were still fresh and great tasting.

My boyfriend and I ate here as per the yelp reviews and were not disappointed. It's super close to the Bowery Ballroom so if you want to grab a bite before the show I would totally recommend Simple NYC. The restaurant is very quaint and small. Don't go there expecting to fit 50 of your closets friends. But a really sweet date idea for two or three. The staff was lovely and kept the restaurant pristine. The decorations on the walls were cute and colorful and added a happy, quirky aesthetic-for all the IG freaks it's very Instagrammable. Now, we both got bubble tea and pokébowls which were super tasty. The bubble tea is fairly inexpensive (about $3) and the taro bubble tea was definitely superior to the others. My Pokébowl was the lump crab meat ringing in at a solid $13.50. The price was appropriate for the quality food and the amount you received. The wanton ""cruncies"" were lovely as well all the fun veggies. The only downside to my experience there was that there are not a lot of veggie options. Maybe one or two if you don't want to order a bunch of sides as your meal. My boyfriend got the only vegan bowl they offered with quinoa, which was super tasty, but a bit disappointing that it was the singular option.

You can expect a little wait since each item is made to order, but it is well worth it.  Staff is friendly and willing to explain and/or provide recommendations depending on your diet. They are also looking to change some of the menu depending on the season and the best available ingredients they can find.  I'm looking forward to coming back again to try their other bowls and bento boxes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/simple-nyc-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I think I've set the bar pretty high for myself by trying out Poke for the first time in Spinfish Poke House in Pasadena, CA, which is supposedly the original poke place that started the trend there... regardless, point is- I've only had poke one other time and that's the only comparison I have. I got the jumbo lump crab meat tuna bowl without aoli and it was nothing to write home about - the crab meat was good but the other additions like the masago, seaweed and pickled ginger were sparse and did not give the rice enough flavor to complement the crab meat resulting in a fairly bland dish to our taste. My friend got the spicy tuna and it was also just okay with similar reasoning, nothing outstanding. The servers/cashiers are super nice and friendly and bubbly and even though it's a tiny place inside, it's a very nice atmosphere to sit and enjoy your bowl.

We opted to book a reservation in the lounge area as we weren't up for the full tasting menu and I'm honestly very glad we did. The ambiance in the lounge/bar area was much more laid back and relaxed than in the main dining area which was a bit noisy. We also received fantastic service throughout the meal. We started with the Oiji Mi version of an Old Fashioned, the name escapes me at the moment. But it was beautiful with an ice cube that had the restaurant logo on it. We also shared the Oysters and Pork Belly for 2 plate which was absolutely amazing. It was such an interesting combo but it worked SO well. Scrumptious. For dessert, I asked if they had an espresso martini on the menu and the waiter recommended the secret menu Exospresso Martini which was the best espresso martini I've ever had in the most beautiful hand blown glass coupes from Japan. Everyone around us commented on how beautiful the glasses were. They will set you back $45 each martini but well worth it in our opinion. A lavish experience that we thoroughly enjoyed on our first date night of 2023 and our last dinner in NYC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oiji-mi-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My partner took a couple spoonfuls of the soup and stopped eating. The waiter never bothered to ask if something was wrong. Instead he said "" you guys must be too full"" and took away the dish. I was beyond speechless to evens say anything. My wagyu kalbi came very thin and the outside layering tasted burnt. While all the photos on yelp depicted a thick cut of meat cooked medium/ medium rare. The waiter never bothered to ask how I liked my meat cooked to start.

Ellen C.,/user_details?userid=JxAkETuoaXiZAE9AzsJyoA,"Forest Hills, NY",8/5/2022,5.0,"You know this is popular not only when you see posts on social media influencers you follow but when you actually see your friends posting this place on social media. The price recently went up from $125 to $135 for a 5 course meal. The reservations were pretty easy to book on RESY but the place actually looked full. The interior looked very modern and the food was all beautifully presented. Service here was exceptional from beginning to end. For the first course, you get all three options: oyster, beef tartare and fois gras which they suggest you eat in that order starting with the oyster. For the second course, we picked bossam for 2. Very filling and the combination of all the ingredients oyster, sides and pork belly wrapped in the cabbage was delicious. For the third choice, we picked the Oiji bowl ($20 supplement)which was raw shrimp, sous vide egg yolk, uni over seasoned rice. Mix it together. This was very fresh and tasted like the sea. For the fourth course we picked the sea bass which was served with fried calamari, semi cooked squid and scallop, clams with a truffle seafood broth. The broth was delicious-everything was delicious but we found the squid a little off and not too fresh. We also picked the wagyu galbi served with carrots, cauliflower over a mash potato purée. This was very well prepared. For the final course we picked the bingsu, so refreshing. As suggested we had the ice part drenched in condensed milk first and added the strawberries to it afterward. So yummy. We also ordered the chocolate mousse with passion fruit ice cream.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oiji-mi-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My absolutely negative review has nothing to do with the food but everything to do with the terrible, rude, inflexible and condescending front of house staff at Oiji Mi. I arrived early for my reservation because my guest had to catch an earlier flight. That change was admittedly on us!  We were told they could accommodate the change only to be told 15 minutes later that we had to wait for our allotted time, which we could not do. We asked to sit in the front or bar but no can do. No big deal. We get it. Things changed. We will just go elsewhere!!  We were then asked to ""sit down and wait for our time"" at which time our table would be ready!  it was as if they were not hearing us. Fast forward this was all chalked up by them to a ""miscommunication"" but it was nothing of the sort. We left only to be charged $100 for a ""no show!""   I returned to clear up what I thought was a mistake only to discover it was very much their intent to charge me for what they interpreted as a ""no show and cancel"". It was sad to me to realize that this new restaurant in my neighborhood would not be another friendly place for me to visit frequently as the front of house had no interest in trying to be flexible and accommodate its customers (or just say ""sorry we can't tonight"" and move on) but instead are inflexible clock watchers standing ready to press the ""charge"" button on Resy (first time ever for me!) rather than create a welcoming NY dining experience. They Completely Missed the point, created a stressful experience that I will never risk repeating. Book it but don't dare be late! They will make you feel bad and will absolutely not be kind or accommodating. All if this was avoidable.

I decided to taste the burger and fries even though I knew most of it would be dinner for the next day. Well my belly was so happy I did. I ended up finish off the fries. That salmon burger was seasoned to perfection. My compliments to the chef. The vibe was just right. They played great music you can chair dance to or get up and dance. I'll definitely be back.

Overall it was just ok for me, some items we ordered were better than others. The mezcal cocktail, Scallop Risotto special were both good but the French fries i have to say were incredible, salty but perfectly cooked and actually were the best part of the meal. But what was really disappointing and left me feeling super bummed was my highly anticipated order of the Beef Bourguignon, classic French dish that any French restaurant should nail. The beef was astonishingly dry and the opposite of tender, the accompanying mushrooms and carrots were obviously cooked separately (sad face), the lardon was non existent and I now wonder if the Beef was even cooked in the deep and rich stew that is supposed to Beef Bourguignon. Will I try Bistro So again? Maybe for brunch, but if they serve Beef Bourguignon like that I don't know if I can trust them to prepare a delicious classic French meal...(sigh)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-so-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Josh H.,/user_details?userid=rvsBYUMIKg-QhH4qSKQExQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",5/14/2022,1.0,"My wife and I ate at Bistro So last night around 7pm. I will start this review with the positives. The ambience was wonderful, the service was great and the fries were delicious. We shared the beef tartare topped with a raw quail egg, and she had the oysters by herself. Unfortunately, around 10pm she started feeling sick and we rushed home. We couldn't get home fast enough and she became violently ill from food poisoning in the car on the drive home. Once home, she spent several hours sick in the bathroom and even chose to sleep in the kitchen to be close by. We've both had food poisoning before and it was the worst I have ever seen. I called the restaurant this evening to inform the manager of what happened so they could look into their food safety, and was clear we weren't trying to gain anything from this situation, we just didn't want anyone else getting sick. The manager (a woman whose name I didn't get) was not at all concerned and was adamant that my wife did not get food poisoning from their restaurant, claiming that you don't see symptoms until a day after exposure, which is untrue (you can become ill after as little as 30 minutes of exposure) and assured me that their food is incredibly fresh and wouldn't even consider the possibility that she got sick from one of the three raw dishes she consumed. We weren't going to leave a negative review as long as the restaurant agreed to simply look into the situation but their lack of concern and accountability deemed it necessary.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-so-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The way the tables are spaced or something makes the place feel kind of empty and not warm. Also the lack of a bar is a miss for me.

The restaurant is so pretty and charming. Even though it was packed, the acoustics were great and we could have a conversation. The food was absolutely delicious. The fried artichoke appetizer (carciofi fritti) with lemon cream dipping sauce which they aptly named ""magic sauce"" was the most delicious I have ever had. All three of us agreed we had never had better fried artichokes. The pasta was also scrumptious. I had the Radiatori with Arugula Pesto, Candied Tomatoes, Pine Nuts, Mozzarella Cream. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the combination of flavors was exquisite. I also had a spicy mezcal paloma served in a beautiful cocktail glass which makes such a difference. For dessert we had the bread pudding and the ricotta mousse. Highly recommend and can't wait to go back.

We decided to start with the bruschetta of the day - it was two pieces of bread (which was served almost cold) topped with tomatoes and some arugula.

When we asked where they got the olive oil (because it was that good!), our waitress brought us a bottle to take home! Such a sweet gesture. We shared two starters - the meatballs & the tris de mini - which were both excellent, and for our main we had the cavatelli.

Misirizzi reminds me of an old rail car apartment- high ceilings, white brick and a long rectangular body. They have a bar with a few tables in the front and a more ""formal"" dinning area in the back that will make you feel like you are sitting in a chic 1920s Williamsburg apartment. I'm not usually one to rave about interiors in my restaurants but there is something about Misirizzi that just feels special when you walk into it. It's Italian menu features a nice variety of pasta and protein based dishes- my friend had the salmon which he liked and I had the spaghetti pomodoro. One of the better versions of the dish that I've experience- perfectly aldente pasta in a flavorful sauce and not overdressed! Our server was great, and very patient with all of our questions.

The chili that came with it was delicious which they said they made in-house. When we received our ramen, we asked about our karage which they said would come in 5 min. My soyu truffle ramen had a subtle flavor but I couldn't detect the truffle flavor. The noodles were thin and absorbed the broth nicely. I tasted the shio broth which had a stronger truffle flavor and seemed more flavorful. The karage arrived towards the end of our ramen and we were told they would be removed from our bill.

Any additional things such as seaweed and eggs come at extra cost. We ordered an appetizer as well- sliced pork belly and it came over a small scoop of rice- I might be able to eat it in two bites.

With a couple of minutes until opening we waited and got seated right away. We ordered karaage, truffle shout soba, and spicy Mala tokatsu soba. The food came out pretty quickly. The karaage was fried well, and the chicken was not dry. The ramen portions were on the smaller side, get the large size if you are hungry I guess. Noodles were cooked well. The ramen is more similar to soba which is why they do label is as ramen I guess. The truffle flavor in the broth is subtle which is how I like it, if you're a big truffle fan then it might not be enough flavor. The mala one definitely had a spicy kick to it. Their pork is not dry like some others I've had. For the price, the portion is smaller than I would like. Worth trying? I think so. Would I line up? Probably not.

First, there's a few dings when it comes to operations. The official hours on Yelp, Google, and their front door notes that lunch is till 3:30pm. However, they start turning people away at 2:30pm so that they can close at 3:30pm. That's not how other restaurants operate. Second, the line is ridiculous. Third, messing up or missing your order is not uncommon. In terms of the ramen, it is ridiculously priced. The truffle is majorly skimped. The broth isn't that flavorful. The noodles, however, do have the right texture and chewiness.

So we decided to order the iberico chashu and ajitama ($4 egg) on the side. Most ramen places would have already included toppings into their ramen, but this place only gives you bamboo shoot and other unnecessary toppings (onions, leek) which they can definitely do without in my opinion.

The soba noodles are good & different than other ramen spots, and I like how some of the ramens were made in a chicken and shrimp broth, and not pork, but the ramen could use more vegetables and a heartier broth in my opinion (I got the original truffle shoyu soba w/out pork).

Heena J.,/user_details?userid=NbIu__Xi38FbR1Pp3gsT0Q,"New York, NY",4/29/2021,4.0,Came for dinner and drinks a couple of weeks ago to catch up with friends. The drinks are amazing - I had two spicy mezcal margaritas and they are strong! I ordered seitan tacos and didn't enjoy them. I asked for no cilantro and it came with a lot of cilantro. I should have stuck to the vegetarian enchiladas which looked great. We ordered queso to share and those were bombs plus they give chips and salsa to start for free. Absolutely love when places do that! Overall the vibes and the drinks were good so giving it a 4 star.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/de-mole-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ofelia E.,/user_details?userid=pFvJD_u68-FSvXKnluTDqA,"New York, NY",2/13/2021,3.0,"Went here for dinner after my friends and I saw all the good reviews it had. We started with the guacamole, then got the tampiquena steak, the pollo con mole, and one of their specials pollo con salsa roja. The guacamole was okay. It had too much onion, cilantro and tomato and not enough avocado (pic attached). It wasn't really flavorful and not spicy at all. The mole was good and my friend loved her steak. I got the pollo with salsa roja served over a plantain mash and bacon pieces. It was good but not great. The chicken was lightly breaded and fried, not grilled as they had stated. The mash was yummy and I could taste the bacon, plus the fried onions added a nice touch. The dish was good but my only real complaint was the quality of the chicken, it was stringy and some parts were tough even though it was supposed to be chicken breast. I had to keep looking for the softer parts to get a good bite. We got the tres leches cake for dessert which was okay, not too impressive. I do wonder which milks they used because it tasted a lot like lactose rather than a sweet almost vanilla like flavor. Both the banana and blackberries it was served with as garnish were not sweet or ripe. Although the staff was very friendly service was very slow and it was very cold even though we were seated inside. The agua de tamarindo was spot on and tasted very authentic, next time I just have to ask for less ice because it was definitely too much. Overall the experience was good but the food did not live up to the hype.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/de-mole-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I had the fish tacos for entree and it was just lacking in flavor. It was just bland fish batter. I soaked it with all the sauces they provided but it still was not quite right.

I ordered a mezcal drink with hibiscus and raspberry, but was delivered a frozen margarita. I was told this drink is ""interchangeable"" with their frozen margarita (which makes no sense, it is a completely different drink with different alcohol), but ok. On top of that, I was charged the wrong amount (they added an extra 5 drinks to the tab). It took at least 30 minutes for our waitress to get the manager to come over to our table to help get the check figured out. He told me I was refunded, and then charged me for the correct amount. They could not give me any kind of receipt for my refund, and when I checked my statement the next day I was never given a refund, so I was charged more than double what I should have been.

Well, prayers do get answered. And they hit it out of the park. I went there last night and had a blast. It started with the wonderful staff that greeted us upon arrival - 4 beautiful ladies all smiling and very welcoming. The setup is similar to Miami with the wonderful open kitchen. I was delighted to see so many of my favorites on the menu like the fabulous roasted cauliflower - a must have. We ordered the Tuna Crispy Rice and the Hamachi Crispy Rice which were my two favorite dishes of the night. The wagyu toast was yummy with just the right amount of truffle purée. The sliced Hamachi with white ponzu, mint, and basil was absolutely amazing. The Korean Fried chicken was really good, but not as good as I had remembered it being in Miami. While I also preferred the delicious red snapper in Miami, the halibut was a great runner up and enjoyed by everyone at our table. Pedro, our waiter, was charming and funny and totally on the ball. He had the food sent out to us at just the right pace. Bethany, the manager, was also very sweet and accommodating. Since we were doing more veggies and seafood last night, I cannot wait to go back for the stone pot Thai Fried Rice with Duck and the short ribs. Great job Kyu, New York.

The roasted cauliflower was so good that we could have licked the plate it was on. The tuna crispy rice was just okay (I say this because it wasn't special versus the other dishes and we've had this at other restaurants in the past.) The entrees were amazing -- wagu beef brisket in lettuce wraps and the duck breast burnt ends. We were huge fans of the king crab stone pot thai fried rice and the baby bok choy with toasted garlic.

Let's just say shishito peppers should be on every bar menu. Ordered pork bun and crispy rice app. Pork Buns were average. I could get the same thing in Chinatown for $4. The crispy rice came after I finished my $30 Martini . Asked for one olive and came with 2. It's a $30 Martini get it right . My friend ordered a Gin Martini. Came with too much vermouth . Told the bartender that . He said sorry.I guess no fixing drinks here .After the rice came the bill was $144. 2 small apps and 3 drinks. After a few weeks it didn't seem as packed and the Local NoHo didn't seem present. Hope they fix things quick. The atmosphere is great. The bar had an unimpressive selection of what is expected in the neighborhood.

While browsing in the city, I could've stopped at the Bowery location but I knew I wanted to see the store. Hence, I made the trek to Greenpoint & I'm so glad I did. Once I walked into the store, I knew I was walking into matcha heaven. The store/tea room looked pristine, with the sunlight naturally lighting up the room. Of course, I'll be returning for a tea tasting but for today, I needed to satisfy my need for more matcha chocolate. Rich, velvety & full of matcha filled each bite and I wanted to buy some to share.

It's certainly not for the spice-intolerant, but for those of you who appreciate some heat, it's an absolute must-try. Our waiter was incredibly kind and made some great recommendations, including the goat neck biryani (the highlight of the meal), the chicken pulao, and the beguni, all of which were a 10/10. We were also lucky enough to be seated indoors, and the ambience of the restaurant is great.

Neha D.,/user_details?userid=uOIg0vB46IJv2mypNd33kg,"Cupertino, CA",11/11/2022,4.0,3.5 stars - Dhamaka requires a reservation a few weeks (almost a month) in advance. I really wanted to try Dhamaka because of all the hype it's gotten in the media and press. There is indoor seating and outdoor seating within a covered tent on the street. I recommend trying as many of the appetizers as possible - I thought these were the yummiest things on the menu! The portions are fairly small but good for sharing if you want to try many things on the menu.

We waited to get a reservation here for a few months and it was worth the wait. The whole experience was top notch including the service and the food. While there are a number of more adventurous options on the menu, we stuck with the Tabak maaz (lamb ribs) , chicken pressure cooker pulao and panner methi.

I don't know why people say the food here is so spicy. I don't think it is. The eggplant appetizer was outstanding. I just loved licking my fingers with the spice seasoning, the lamb chops are phenomenal. But extremely fatty I had the garlic ghost dish which people rave about. I thought it was OK. Didn't have tremendous flavor, was not that spicy at all, had a lot of bone and not so much meat, and was very oily. The paratha was very disappointing. Very oily, and very flaky. Definitely over cooked. I would come back to try the fry pomfret and the goat testicles appetizer which is supposedly phenomenal. The bhel puri is phenomenal by the way.  I had that the first time I was here I thought the goat biryani was very good. Huge portion.

Their biryani is THE BEST in the city (my family's from Hyderabad, where the dish originated, so trust me when I say I know a good biryani). Right amount of spicy while still being so delicious. I'm so upset that I just realized I haven't reviewed this place cause I can't even remember all the dishes I tried. But off the top of my head, get the paneer (appetizer), okra, and the biryani!

For apps we got the prawn, paneer tikka, bharela marcha, and the beguni. For the main course we got the goat neck biryani. Service was friendly and all of the food was good, but I don't really think it was good enough to deserve the price point. Just seems like another ""trendy"" Instagram hyped up place that people go to just to say they went there. You can get just as tasty food at plenty of other spots in the city for a much more reasonable price.

The atmosphere was quite lively and service was very friendly and attentive. Our server helped us with a couple of suggestions to complete our order and we ended up ordering the right amount of food for the three of us. First were the Ajwani Paneer Tikka, Papdi Chaat, and Paplet Fry. For the main entrees we ordered the Lamb Shank, which was a special that night, the famous Goat Neck Dum Biryani and some Paratha on the side. It was all a great combination, very flavorful. The lamb was super tender. We were excited to try dishes other than the ones we would usually order at an Indian restaurant.

Lisa O.,/user_details?userid=wxI2NlEM-zeECCQ5px0L2w,"San Francisco, CA",12/19/2022,2.0,"The sole feature you need to know is that it's in demand. It's an awful experience. Guests are overbooked and then repeatedly told throughout the meal that they are on a tight schedule - 1 hour and 15 minutes per table. You are treated very rudely, over and over again, in the name of moving people through the dining process. It would be faster if the menu weren't bizarrely incomprehensible (e.g. the ""Grill"" section is actually what would be labeled appetizers or starters on any other menu, and the ""Snacks"" are not described with their ingredients, so the server says things like, ""This is the cold one!"" and has to go ask the kitchen to answer the question, ""what is the crunchy stuff this dish is made of?""). Main dishes take forever to come out, even though there are only a few options available that are mostly long braises. Food is served in the pots they are cooked in (like a crappy aluminum pressure cooker, not a charming bit of stoneware). The food is OK, but sloppy. Some of it is so spicy that the servers explain this is why they wear shirts that say ""Unapologetically Indian,"" but I like spice, and this was just lazy cooking. Our chicken biryani had two disgusting chunks of hacked-up dark meat on the bone, with little chards of small, sharp bones, large curry leaves, and clumps of gristle strewn throughout the dish. The paratha was greasy, chewy, and flavorless. The paneer app was ok. The raita was watery and bland. Mainly, though, it's a very poorly run business. You are constantly hounded about time from the moment you arrive. You are told you can't add anything to your order after you pick a main dish because they take 30-40 minutes to make, and then you are warned again before you finish eating your main that you need to order a dessert if you want one because they take a long time to prepare. We were asked to leave our table less than one minute after we paid our bill to allow another party to sit. The restaurant's overall rudeness and absurd inability to time out basic, rustic food make the prices ($40 mains, $20 ""snacks"") laughable. This place is a mess, and it's exploiting some popularity to generate a false sense of demand through rushing the reservations, cutting corners in the kitchen, and deliberately abusing diners with policies that keep you from enjoying the truly mediocre food. I gave it an extra star because the paneer appetizer was pretty good (not outstanding) and our waiter was sweet, if inept.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dhamaka-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Not pictured were gobi keema and murgh seekh, which were too tasty and fresh to pause for photos. The pao melts in your mouth with the gobi. Best way to describe food: high attention to detail and freshness, yet tastes home-cooked, authentic, and packed with flavor. All cocktails we tried were solid and each very unique, tasty in its own way. Our favorite was the cocktail with melon flavor and also the coconut water.

Nitin B.,/user_details?userid=JkpP4P-QeeXBmWw1Fm1t9g,"Dallas, TX",7/7/2022,2.0,"We made reservations here a month in advance. First the good, the place definitely has flair with the interior decor, the name itself (Dhamaka means explosion), blasting bollywood tunes, and the creative cocktail list. The grilled paneer arrived first and was our favorite. Beautifully soft and charred and spiced just right. Service was good. Now the not so great. The Eggplant fritters were tender on the inside but lacked flavor. Dishes had a healthy dusting of chaat masala which is great on chaat but not on everything. The fried pompfret looked appetizing with a crunchy coating but the fish inside was insipid and hadnt soaked any of the marinade. The lamb shank was in a beautiful rogan josh-esque red curry, succulent, and very tender, apparently slow cooked for 2 days. But alas it was so spicy that we could not really enjoy it. The veggie pulao was also inedibly spicy. Upon telling the waiter we couldnt eat the food because it was so spicy, he grinned and pointed to his tshirt (that all of the wait staff wear) that says ""Unapologetically Indian."" The waiter did bring us some free shots of mango lassi which was nice. Finally there was only 1 choice for dessert, a cottage cheese souffle. This place is obviously not kid friendly. Based on the positive reviews of this place, a lot of folks enjoy Dhamaka because they like the adventure and machismo of eating spicy food. However if you are looking for some Indian comfort food with a modern take, this is not it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dhamaka-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were seated outside (in the covered tent portion) on a rainy day and did have to desk with some rain leaking through the roof onto our table. My group also felt a tad rushed by service to get seated and get through our meal (hence the 4 not 5 stars).

It's at least unwanted 'suation', if not a light form of fraud. As for the food, some was ok, but for the most part it seemed the kitchen used the same spice mix on everything. Boring!

Definitely recommend making reservations especially for a weekend. I came here on a friday around 6pm and luckily snagged an outdoor dining table because indoor was fully booked. They do have bar seating too but only drinks and appetizers served there. Luckily the outdoor dining area has a fan so it wasn't too hot even though it was 90 degrees. For drinks we got the kharboozy drink and the passion mango lassi. Both super good. If you like a subtle taste of alcohol but refreshing, kharboozy is the drink for you. The passion mango lassi was mango-y and yummyyy. My bf got two of them! For food we got the ajwani paneer tikka which is kind of like a baked cheese with some onions on the side and a dipping sauce. The highlight of the meal though was the gurda kapoora aka goat testicles. SO. DELICIOUS. Spicy yes but the bread that it comes with goes so well. Light and crunchy bread with bits of goat testicle and kidney. And for main entree we got the goat neck biryani. It was $39 but it was a pretty big portion with a crispy bread coating on the top which they crack and you can dip into a yogurt pomegranate sauce.

Seby I.,/user_details?userid=MM-MlSJqR1VnaWr5kSqyxg,"Manhattan, NY",7/2/2021,5.0,"Two Lasooni Prawns (garlic prawns in Hindi)  were mouthwatering. On the menu, the ingredients listed were garlic and black pepper. When the chef came to talk to me, I inquired what other spices were in this dish. Yogurt was his answer. ""And?"" ""And if I told you what else you would take my job!"" Laughter ensued. Chef Chintan Pandya has won accolades for his adventurous Indian cuisine. Two years ago I ate at Adda Student Canteen in Long Island City. Then a delivery from Rahi so was excited to be here. Located at Essex Market, Dhamaka with its bright red and yellow exterior stands out among the more drab colors of Delancey Street. There is an outdoor covered patio with tables and chairs and the interior which one can access through the entrance of the market. Indian music emanates from the restaurant and it feels lively to be here. Dhamaka offers provincial Indian cuisine which is unusual from the usual offerings of chicken tikka masala at other Indian restaurants. Goat kidneys and testicles? How about Goat Belly? There are also more familiar dishes like Ajwani Paneer and Murgh Kofta for the faint of heart. On my visit, I ate Paplet Fry which is a fish similar to Pomfret in Mumbai and then I ate the two tiger prawns. Raita (yogurt) came with pomegranate seeds that created a colorful tableau. Two paos (rolls) glistened on the plate and just looking at it I felt instantly transported to India where it is ubiquitous, And the flavor? Heavenly and authentic. The severs couldn't get over my adulation of these ordinary rolls. Chef Pandya told me that they make the rolls in house as it was difficult to have other bakeries recreate it. By now I was stuffed but wanted to have the mango lassi. The server was kind to give me a sample in a tiny copper mug. Passion fruit and rosewater transformed the ordinary mango lassi into a spectacular concoction and if it had rum in it I would have been dancing on the tabletops with joy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dhamaka-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Alexa D.,/user_details?userid=MA_fEhdKLExgSsRurt1DSg,"New York, NY",2/22/2022,5.0,"Everything was delicious but the Champaran meat (mutton) definitely stole the show! It comes with a whole head of roasted garlic, which the server mixed with the meat upon serving. Highly recommend but if you are unable to tolerate spice or heat this may not be the place for you. The server I had was very knowledgeable and gave great suggestions based on our tastes, so if you're stumped be sure to ask questions! If I came here again, I'd skip the Doh Khleh. It tasted like pork belly in a cilantro salad. Not bad, and to be honest if I ordered this at any other restaurant it would probably be a star item. But here there are too many other delicious competing dishes on the menu! The Beguni had a really interesting flavor and came within a mustard dip. The Bharela Marcha should not be missed; such an interesting and delicious flavor combination: spicy, sweet and peanut-y.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dhamaka-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There are many other expensive Indian restaurants in the city if you want a different experience with Indian food. We were 50/50 on liking and really disliking what we ordered. Paneer tikka was by far the best. We couldn't eat the lamb chops or eggplant because the lamb was really fatty and gamely. The eggplant was mostly the deep fried breading, which wasn't clear from the menu that it would be prepared like that. The potato patties were also confusing - pretty much it was mashed potatoes with Chana dal and various other chaat fixings. The chicken kofta curry was good and I'd get it again along with the paneer.

Regan M.,/user_details?userid=jgXz_fim3kOFEiONh5vogw,"New York, NY",8/14/2021,5.0,"Of all the restaurants I've been to, Dhamaka is easily the one I get asked about the most. That's why, even though it's been 4 months since I visited, I feel I would be remiss not to feature it on this nascent account. The energy of Dhamaka is reminiscent of the college buddy we all had for whom a few sips of alcohol unlocked a fount of adoration for everyone around him. In saying that, I do not mean to suggest that Dhamaka is drunken and unfocused. It's emphatically not. The restauranteur behind the project, Roni Mazumdar, came to our table (likely alerted to our presence by the rapidity of our gurda kapoora, macher jhol, and champaran consumption) and told us about the multi-year research process that went into the restaurant's beautiful and bawdy Indian village food. But in Roni's attentiveness (and, of course, Chef Chintan Pandya's reverent cooking), you can get a sense of the mix of enthusiasm and joy and earnestness and empathy that Dhamaka channels into their singular menu and colorful space, and that I meant to evoke with my analogy. These are unabashed, assertively-spicy curries. The basis of each is a caramelized paste of ginger-forward, salty aromatics laden with green chiles that you find yourself scraping from the bottom of the vessel long after you've consumed all of the dish's featured protein. If you are looking for creamy tikka masala and its ilk, go elsewhere. At Dhamaka, the richness comes from an ample layer of chili-inflected oil that slicks eat bite as you lift it from the pan to your lips. Eating here is transportive. It's escapism at its most grounded and intentional. We may soon find our lives impinged again by Delta, but at least we will still have Dhamaka.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dhamaka-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The prawn grill only came with one and although it was tasty I'd try the peanut and pepper grill next time. The paneer methi main course is big ! And delicious. Recommended. I took some home with me. Rice doesn't come with the mains so order some on the side. My friend got the baby shark and this was also surprisingly good, different and had a lot of meat in it. As far as bread , I thought the Chapati was better than the paratha but I wish the Chapati was bigger ( wish they had naan actually! ) The drinks aren't too big but they were also flavorful and unique. My friend got two of the NRI which is a tasty coconut milk and scotch and Cointreau drink, tasty. I got the betel leaf and gin and ginger liqueur Paan e Bahar drink and that was nice and definitely different. I also got the mezcal and passion fruit Joshila drink and even for someone who doesn't like mezcal it was good because the fruit cuts a lot of the smokiness.

That said, for all the hype, there were other parts of our experience that were quite disappointing. Our cocktails were very watered down, and lacked taste-- yet were priced at $17-$18. And service was really off-- our waiter couldn't really answer our questions about the menu, forgot a drink order, and at the end of the meal, asked us kind of rudely why we only ordered appetizers (even though we ordered 4 appetizers between two people, which ended up costing as much as two entrees!)

Anuj P.,/user_details?userid=nbo23NVBdYgHl378w65PyA,"Park Ridge, NJ",12/23/2021,5.0,"The deeper dive into the cuisine of the subcontinent is what Dhamaka is doing. It's the thesis statement. Regional favorites done the right way. If you're expecting chicken tikka or malai kebab or chana masala or butter chicken... this is not the place. You will not find any of the typical Indian restaurant menu names on this menu. Not only is it regional but it's typical dabha / street food aggressive too. This is why you're seeing a lot of people saying its over spiced or too spicy. For some, the flavors come out of left field if you're too used to Punjabi Indian food, but for others, it's the level of Indian cuisine you simply cannot find at other indian restaurants. Be ready to treat each dish as it's own individual oasis. This isn't a put it all together, add some rice and eat it type place. This place requires your attention and determination. The raw spices are used to the fullest and rawest extent. The heat is coming more from the raw spices that actual extra chili powder on most dishes. The seekh kebab is divine. The biryani is almost as perfect as you could ask for from a restaurant. It's all good. It's all worth trying. This is a super fun and cool Environment as well to try this angle and take on Indian food as well. The cocktails are mos definitely unique and a must try. One of the most crucial things that Dhamaka does perfectly is the onion and chutney that comes with some of the dishes. The onion and chutney is the key part of Indian meals for a lot of people. You will not be disappointed by the onion and chutney! Also, the prawns. You've never tried prawns like this. I will bet you any amount of money. Next time I come here, I'm only ordering those prawns!  Wow! Amazing work team Dhamaka!

Next time I am in for the Chicken Masala Pulso made of bone-in chicken, cinnamon, and basmati rice.  The service was excellent.  The place itself is in a small area inside the Essex Market.  If you are waiting for a table, you can check out the market and drink citrus hops beer in the basement (just what I did!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dhamaka-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I initially suggested this spot because I liked the vibes of the restaurant. It was very nicely decorated and the dim lights gave it an intimate and cozy feeling. I was very excited to try their omurice but did not enjoy my experience. The egg omelet itself was cooked well and tasted good. However, I really disliked the sauce that the rice was placed on.  It tasted too ketchup-y and was sweet/sour/tangy in an unpleasant way. The Loco Moco (hamburger rice) we got had the same problem. The hamburger itself was cooked fine and wasn't anything special but they placed the rice once again on the same ketchup-y sauce that ruined the entire dish for me.

Ended up ordering just two sandwiches for takeout since they had no seats and didn't want to wait. It took a while probably around 20 minutes for 2 sandwiches but they were busy so figured the kitchen was pretty backed up.. They did have a little waiting area inside so you could sit down while you wait. Ebi sando was super delicious! Katsu sando was pretty good but definitely preferred the shrimp.

I went there in December of 2019 and fell in love with the quality and the presentation of food as well as their hip atmosphere. I was there yesterday with three of my friends, and we were all disappointed. First of all, they jacked up the price significantly, which I can understand given the situation with pandemic, but what I can't accept is the fact that the food quality is not what it used to be. Three of us got omurice and one of us loco moco. Egg tasted like plastic, and rice and sauce were too salty. We could not finish the meal...

Sereen G.,/user_details?userid=ZhlXmmpYNq6eyRVOBCnOxw,"West New York, NJ",1/27/2020,4.0,We went to Aoi Kitchen on Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. We probably waited for 5 mins to get seated. They have a nice waiting area with a comfortable couch. Overall restaurant is really nice and calming environment. We ordered omurice and loco moco. Food was delicious and side dishes that came with were also very delicious. Portion wise it's a bit small for the price. I am giving Aoi Kitchen 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a big pricey for what it is.

You can't go wrong with the classics like salmon and spicy tuna but the spicy chicken is really good. They're so fluffy and huge. Two of them would be more than enough for a meal. They are kept warm somehow and are just so satisfying to bite into. They're freshly made and ready to eat. No need to assemble like the ones you get in some markets/convenience stores.

The rice balls are massive compared the the smaller and flatter rice balls from other rice ball chains. I ordered the bomb rice ball (comes with tuna, salmon, and soy marinated kelp). Highly recommend this, great combination of flavors if you want a sampler all in one and can't choose between multiple fillings. The spicy tuna was equally delicious and very filling. Thought it would be mostly rice and very little filling, but there is actually a decent amount of filling inside. You can order from the counter and have them pack it for you or you can head further into the store and check out the deli section where there are more bento boxes, drinks, etc. They also have a prepacked lunch deal in the deli section during weekdays that comes with 2 rice balls and the karaage!

I've been generally satisfied with the proportion of filling to rice, just the right amount to get some filling with each bite of rice. The little stand isn't manned all day--towards the end of the day they leave the remaining rice balls individually wrapped in plastic wrap on the counter with clear price lists so people can just pick up and check out.

We got two drinks, and order of the curry puffs, which we totally had to get another order of. The best staff, amazing ambiance, and the music really impressed me. Me and my friend felt totally welcomed and comfortable the whole time and decided it's an absolute return. The staff also brought out an order of chive dumplings on the house. Love you guys so much. Truly a sweet staff",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mao-mao-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
