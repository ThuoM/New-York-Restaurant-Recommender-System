The fish had a nice crispy outer which is what I prefer in a fish taco (you can keep the grilled ones away from me). The green sauce made me sweat - i like spicy but that's what it does to me.

Leslie T.,/user_details?userid=1msVg_B-Ef6K814sQDOTPA,"New York, NY",1/23/2022,4.0,"Luchadores is a small no-frills stall on the outskirts of South Seaport - basically the kind of store you come across as you're heading home from a nice walk. The line was pretty long and moved quite slow, there were 2 parties in front of us and it took around 15 minutes. There were only 2 guys working back there in a small space, so I understood. Everyone in line was patient and seemed like a good time to talk on date night. The burrito was massive and the fish taco was good, but the ingredients didn't taste as fresh as Tacombi down the street or others in the area. You get what you pay for. They also ran out of lettuce when we got there so he put cabbage instead (which I actually prefer) but running out of lettuce at peak dinner time is a big no-no. I think that was part of the slow down too because one of them had to keep running back to the fridge to check for ingredients and refill stuff. I appreciate the large portion sizes, but did note that neither of the servers were wearing masks while making the food. At least they changed their gloves in between, but while ringing us up he touched the cash register with his gloved hand, then used the same hand to sprinkle cheese on our burrito, only to swipe our card with the same gloved hand O_O",https://www.yelp.com/biz/luchadores-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The tortillas seem like they came out of a bag and weren't even warmed. The tacos come with no unique or individualized ingredients specific to each type of taco. They just ask what toppings you want on your tacos. The choices were a basic pico, boring shredded lettuce, cold cheese, and super expensive guacamole. They have multiple types of sauces you can choose from, so that's ok. It's basically an expensive Taco Bell.

Excited to try this cute spot after walking past it for months, I dropped in around 2pm last Friday with a friend to grab a quick bite only to be greeted by an unhelpful staff and a confusing ordering system. My friend went for the fish taco (ringing up at nearly $6 for a single taco) and I opted for the cajun shrimp burrito, tempted by the potential for interesting flavor combinations. Now, as a Bay Area native maybe I've just been spoiled by mission-style burritos, but I'd easily have taken Chipotle, at half the price, over what I was served at Luchadores.

The rice was on point. The beans even more so. The Carne asada was seasoned just right. The chicharron taco was pulled pork that was just devine. It comes with cracklings on top. The crackling alone is good enough to eat on a slipper. This just puts the chicharron taco over the edge for me. Love at first bite. I enjoyed this dish so much, I went right back a half hour later.

Â The Yelp hours are inaccurate so call first before you pass on this place. Â This is one of those hidden gems in Chinatown. Â Classic Taiwanese street food eats. Â We always stop through to grab a meal or occasional dessert when passing through Chinatown. Â The place is a bit small but they do have two larger tables and can get crowded quickly but worth the visit.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Eterna T.,/user_details?userid=S0T7laoGM6lq02Dg4aP8rA,"New York, NY",3/7/2021,5.0,"Wow I'm so happy to find a really good Taiwanese restaurant in Manhattan ^^ As a Taiwanese American I'm happy to say that the dishes here are very authentic! I was pleasantly surprised by the pork chop and hong you chao shou (wonton in red oil). My friend ordered the fried oyster and the chicken leg over rice and honestly, every single dish was delicious and appropriately seasoned. The pork chop, which is part of their restaurant name, was very good and evenly seasoned/lightly roasted, plus because I got it a la carte it only cost me $3! It has a good amount of fatty vs lean meat and is cut into nice edible strips for you. The chicken leg and braised sauce over rice was also good, with a very thin fried film on the chicken so it's not too greasy or fried but still has a bit of smoky flavor. The real surprise to me was the wonton in chili oil. The first time I had it ten years ago, my friend took me to a local famous one in Taipei somewhere near Da An and I have been trying to find a comparable place in the US since, and I think I finally found one! The red chili oil is very fragrant and has plenty of minced garlic and cilantro so it is very flavorful.

Timothy L.,/user_details?userid=CDA9Yrh4fIxHZPFuI0sbTQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/2/2020,4.0,"Came back on this Sunday to try their pork chop. Ordered the pork chop rice and the pork chop noodle soup. The pork chop was nicely fried; not too dry. It was tasty with a hint of five spice seasoning which made this unique from the pork chop that I usually get from Vietnamese and Korean restaurants. The rice was also seasoned with five spice seasoning as well. Both dishes came with chopped pickled mustard green. I also decided to try the salt and pepper chicken. Crispy piece of dark meat chicken fried with a breading and also seasoned with five spice powder which made it very flavorful. Didn't taste the pepper; should have name it Five Spice Chicken instead. Overall, a nice dining experience for only less than $17.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The rice itself is mixed with regular cabbage as well as sweet and sour cabbage and when mixed well with the rice gives an amazing mix of salty, sweet, and sour burst of flavor. The reason I give it a 4 star, is because it wasn't exactly the nicest looking place, service was ok, and unless you get their popular dishes, they may or may not be good. For now, I would definitely come back when I crave my pork chop over rice and maybe next time I'll try their highly advertised shaved ice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The herbal jelly was homemade, tasted very different than the usual canned kind they serve- lighter flavor, and silkier.

Daniel S.,/user_details?userid=PoLCjBjppLUmG-rSpX3WNg,"Philadelphia, PA",8/18/2017,3.0,I had lots of different Taiwanese food and street food. This restaurant probably chooses to make food in an old fashion (traditional) way. That's why food tastes very different and homemade style. I would say it's not authentic but I'm not a huge fan of the vintage homestyle Taiwanese food. If you are into nostalgia dramatic flavor from your childhood in Taiwan you'll probably love this place a lot ( I'm assuming you're roughly 40 year old now :P). But in summary food is kinda oily but super cheap.

Vivian Y.,/user_details?userid=Mp-vjRBdI1JyvtzuE-Infw,"Brooklyn, NY",10/3/2015,4.0,"My usual at this place is the chicken leg over rice with a marinated egg (extra $.50). I always add the egg because it's only $.50 and it reminds me of childhood. During my most recent trip, I opted for the salt & pepper chicken over rice instead which seems like a new menu item since I hadn't seen it before (or maybe I didn't notice it?). I wasn't that impressed with it since it tasted like popcorn chicken and there wasn't much of a salt & pepper taste. I do like that they used dark meat which was juicy and wasn't really oily. I also like that it's less of a hassle to eat rather than the chicken leg. To me the best part of their rice dishes has to be the pickled mustard green and ground meat. It just works so well together with the whole dish. For around $6, this is definitely a cheap and good eat.

It was sticky and juicy, with generous bits of shredded pork and vegetables, including peas, which was a first for me. And finally, their shaved ice is SO GOOD!

Just point at the pictures. The food is satisfyingly good at a small price point. The pork chops are delicious. I'd like the oyster pancake but could do without the sweet Thai chili sauce that just didn't work it. The vegetable noodles are plenty to share. It was thick Udon like noodles in a light broth.

Jason T.,/user_details?userid=X8x9iXcPH1oo0qYXdnnoeg,"New York, NY",8/3/2017,3.0,"Tucked in the famous winding street of Doyers is where you'll find this restaurant. I am unfortunately a big fan of pork, live close by and decided to visit here with my niece for dinner yesterday. We got there around 6pm and found the place pretty full. We asked to sit and were directed to a large round table where 2 separate other guests were sitting. Alright. There was enough room for us though. I ALWAYS do my research before attending a restaurant and as you may have guessed, they have pork chops. We ordered one as well as the wonton with spicy oil and the salt and pepper chicken over white rice. The pork chop was okay. It was a descent size. The wontons were boiled and were surrounded by an oil that was just right in spice -- as I am a punk when it comes to anything spicy. I don't remember however the wontons having any meat in them. It was more noodle than anything and if there was any meat contained, it was at a bare minimal. The dish was garnished with a teaspoon of garlic and cilantro. The salt and pepper chicken was the most pleasurable for me. Just enough chicken (the size of popcorn chicken) for us. There was flavor there. Also served on a mountain of white rice and a ladle-filled portion of greens, which I could have done without. There was a fragrant note to them that was offsetting. There was also some cabbage in the mix and I was okay with that. A can of Coke and a Snapple Lemon IT to seal the deal. The ladies serving were stoic and will give you hot tea if you ask. All this for $15. Wow!!! They have take out here as well. I might visit again because they do have an extensive menu. Not a priority though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kimberly K.,/user_details?userid=_qYjW9xj6ndi1puZ6GxQkQ,"Plainview, NY",12/7/2017,2.0,"Wanted a quick bite- mainly to avoid the cold and was looking for something a little cheaper (as I've been spending way out of my budget). After scoping around on Yelp, I decided to put in a pick up order here. There seemed to be a lot of rave reviews about the fried chicken bento box so that's what I decided to order. This spot is small, snuggled in the middle of a lot of other Chinatown shops but easy to find. The cashier wasn't too attentive (maybe because the store was empty)? The bubble tea that I ordered was probably the worst one I've had and most definitely not something I would ever order here again. It was extremely watered down and quite expensive given the plethora of bubble tea establishments in its near proximity. The bento box was quite small-town a lot smaller than I expected it to be. The fried chicken however was delicious- packed with a lot of savory seasoning with each bite. Usually, when you order a bento box, you're expecting a pretty light on the stomach but satisfying meal.

The meat wontons here simply do not have any meat in it. If you are lucky, you may see minimally visible pieces of ground meat. The pork chops that it's known for were also lackluster. They did not marinate the meat at all and there is an unpleasant 'raw' taste to it. The seaweed cold dish was also undercooked, making it difficult to chew and swallow. The popcorn chicken was decent, but adding basil instead of cilantro would make it more authentic.

George K.,/user_details?userid=QP2zlxvclIUT9ODNrhWlUA,"Irvine, CA",11/22/2015,5.0,"You know that One Star Michelin dim sum place in Hong Kong? Well, my rating is done in the same respect: the food is so good, that no other considerations like decor, etc. matter. Â When you walk inside, you see an extremely humble restaurant reminiscent of a small family owned restaurant in Taiwan. The large round tables are shared so be prepared to say hi to some strangers (everyone's really friendly so no big deal). Â The place would probably get a ""B"" in cleanliness, but once the food arrives at the table none of that matters. I'm Taiwanese American and had not eaten Taiwanese food in 3 months. After ordering the shredded pork rice (a staple of Taiwanese cuisine) and taking a monstrous bite, I began to cry. The humble flavors reminded me of Taiwan and my childhood when my mom would cook this dish for me after a day at school. I had an ""Ego- Ratatoille"" moment (when he ate the Ratatouille, Ego thought of his childhood) and had I had a pen to write notes, I would have also dropped it. Â The food is extremely delicious, simple, full of umami, and happiness. The staff is extremely friendly and also, did I mention the food is UBER CHEAP? Basically, a must when you're in NYC and if you live nearby, a regular place to visit indeed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ucilia W.,/user_details?userid=EUT64zAfjzFqo3nC0elhXg,"Oakland, CA",6/2/2018,2.0,"I was disappointed with the four dishes and one dessert I ordered here. As a Taiwanese, I had hoped that this place would serve food that is at least minimally good. It's not. I wonder if the restaurant once had a Taiwanese chef but no more. I ordered well-known street food -- maybe that was a mistake. The pan fried oyster cake, a signature street food in Taiwan, was so unauthentic that they really should use another name for it. Their version is basically spring onion cake with bits of oysters; the sauce is the sweet and sour kind that's typically served with roast duck. If you've been to Taiwan, then you know the sauce should taste completely different. I also had Taiwanese marinated duck, salt+pepper chicken, Taiwanese kimchee and shaved ice (taro, red beans and condense milk). The duck and chicken are ok. The shaved ice was sad: globs of taro and red beans drenched in condense milk on top of fast-melting ice. I've never been served a worse-looking Taiwanese shaved ice. Perhaps the rice and noodle dishes are worth your time; I wouldn't know. I just wish I had a better experience eating there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
L. C.,/user_details?userid=U7ZyiQBC5__cxD2Jd5zqAQ,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",2/25/2018,1.0,"After reading all the good reviews, we decided to give this place a try. Yes, the food was cheap and the quality matched the prices. I grew up in Taiwan so I know what's good Taiwanese food. This restaurant is a cheap imposter. Nothing authentically Taiwanese. We ordered seafood stir fried noodles, pork chop rice, oyster pancake, fried oysters, and Taiwanese cabbage. The seafood was from frozen seafood packages so it's chewy and not tasty. The pork chops and minced pork sauce on the rice were not seasoned well and tasted stale. Instead of using tapioca starch in traditional Taiwanese oyster pancakes, they added wheat flour and that totally changed the texture. The sauce for oyster pancake wasn't made properly. The fried oysters were American style with thick flour coating instead of Taiwanese style with light coating. Even the cabbage was Napa cabbage instead of Taiwanese cabbage!

Rather than coming with bacon and egg, it's all a la carte. The problem is when you order the bacon, they literally bring you a side of bacon instead of adding thin strips of bacon to the burger. On top of that, the bacon was all fat and the fries did not come with the truffle aioli. Since it's all a la carte, what used to be $28 cost me over $40. The menu stated the price of the bacon was $5, but when the bill came, we got charged $12!!! If the burger had been good or better than the original, Â I wouldn't have minded the price increase given inflation. My mom's risotto came out cold.

For cocktails we went with an old fashioned made with an Elijah Craig Bourbon and the Oaxacan from the menu. The presentation on the Oaxacan was creative and helped keep it at the proper temperature. No spoiler - you'll have to go to see it! We split the cocktail shrimp - always a good test - and passed easily. The scallops were excellent although the corn spoon bread could have been warmer. Chicken with mashed and Brussell sprouts had a delicious crust. Coffee gelato was a nice finish and paired well with another old fashioned. Service was attentive, too! We'd have felt good about the value in NYC - but the live music totally put this place over the top. On Sunday night it was an excellent trio playing 1920s traditional jazz that evoked Coney Island.

However, the taste of almost every dish we had was extremely underwhelming. The trout was cooked beautifully. The skin was crispy, but it needed salt badly. Portions were small, too.

Farah G.,/user_details?userid=7KmDkQr1-HN6Ua-olZKWwA,"Centereach, NY",8/25/2021,5.0,"As someone who doesn't always take the time out to leave reviews when I have a good experience, I had to leave a rave review for this restaurant because my experience last night was UNBELIEVABLE. My waitress' name Â was Young and if I could leave a review for her alone, I would give her 10 stars! From start to finish, this restaurant exceeded my expectations. I went for a special birthday dinner and the ambiance was incredible. The live music was excellent (not too loud and we were sitting right in front of the stage), and the food/drinks were absolutely divine. We started with the combo meat/cheese/patÃ© board and octopus, then had the NY strip and the Chilean sea bass as entrees (the Chilean sea bass with cauliflower purÃ©e was OUTSTANDING, I swear I dreamt about it in my sleep), and because it was my boyfriend's birthday, they sent over a very cute complimentary chocolate cupcake with a candle, and we ordered the Sphere for dessert which was gorgeous and worth every penny. Their whiskey selection is out of this world (so many to choose from, almost overwhelmingly so) so we chose to do a whiskey flight. Young was so informative and really took the time out to explain each and every whiskey to us. She even gave him a little whiskey on the house while we were waiting for dinner just as a birthday gesture. I ordered two cocktails beforehand which were both also great. We never felt unattended because they checked on us frequently, and I can't stress enough, this was probably the best dining experience I've ever had BAR NONE. If you're thinking about going to this restaurant and bringing someone special, RUN don't walk. I'll certainly be back in the future!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sunday brunch at Fine and Fare is an absolute must if you're not a brute. Prices were fair, food great, decor was simply gorgeous, I just love this classy place. 5-Stars + 1. Of all the brunches in the City I've been to, this place was the most....pleasant. Chris our server was amazing, so attentive to us, offering unique menu items, making recommendations.

Kinza J.,/user_details?userid=rl_t_WBpGRhdnmbWr0bGzw,"Buckley, Manchester, CT",10/23/2019,4.0,"If you want an upscale dine-in experience, there is no better place than fine and rare. Food portions are incredible along with the taste so definitely worth every penny you spend. I hosted my fiancÃ©'s birthday party here but the reservation alone required a pre-order of food and a deposit which can be very frustrating to deal with if guests don't show up so you lose money. However, the service is just so exceptional and the management/chef are there to give you the best time you can have. Even going back and forth via email with the manager/director was prompt and easy. They do need to accommodate guests of larger than 6/7 parties with the ability to pay individually for what they order, that would've saved me a lot of trouble and money. The 28-layer cake was custom made for my fiancÃ© and was hands down the best cake I've ever had. I truly want to thank the chef for such an art piece. Every guest who tried the cake literally wanted to take a slice home with them. My only problem with the place is the ridiculously loud music that makes it impossible to have a normal conversation. If the jazz musicians are performing, please at least turn the regular music off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Well firstly a steak that is not drenched in sauce. The description of the Tamahauk steak states it comes with a chimichurri sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't doing the meat justice. The steak came drenched in some sort of sauce that overpowered the flavour of the meat. The said chimichurri sauce came on the side together with blue cheese sauce. When I ordered the same steak in other steak houses it was always seasoned and dry to showcase the meat. Also, a small order of asparagus that costs $14 seems odd since it wasn't anyhting special. Everything else was top notch. The scallops, the octopus, and crab cocktail. Will I be back? Yes, but not for the steak. I think most steak enthusiasts will agree that proper steak is served to showcase the meat, and if the meat is good then only salt and pepper are needed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Â We've been all over for steak but wanted to try a new place for a birthday. Â Lets start with the great ... the smokey drinks are absolutely delicious and will leave you craving for refills, the live jazz set the perfect mood, the waitstaff was extremely attentive, and the overall design with a large fireplace was perfect. Â Very few places are so beautiful and allow you to sit at a table right next to soothing jazz. Â The coat check was a nice option. Â The menu is very diverse so whether you're in the mood for meat, fish, or pasta, you wont leave hungry. Â There is also a great selection of whiskey, cognac and other ""flights"" so you get to try a drop of a handful of variations. Â If you end up buying a bottle of liquor, they offer the option of saving it for you whenever you come back. Â I truly enjoyed absolutely everything about this restaurant except for the steak because it was covered with some sort of a brown sauce. Â A $140.00 steak should not have any sort of spices, sauces or anything else on it besides perhaps a dash of salt & pepper. Â Adding anything on a steak is equally shameful as cooking it 'well done' as both options will kill it a 2nd time and you wont experience the mouth watering flavor that a good quality steak should deliver. Â Oddly enough, this is the 1st restaurant that has done such a thing and the menu description hasn't included it. Â While the menu did say that 2 sauces will come with the steak, they came on the side, so I'm not sure what the brown sauce was since it wasnt listed on the menu. Â I truly hope that such an amazing restaurant will drop the steak sauce.

c j.,/user_details?userid=or2cnvwtEFRivbEHp_fo5w,"New Haven, CT",2/4/2019,5.0,"I have been to Fine & Rare several times, which for me, is the greatest compliment I can pay an establishment. Why? Because with the ever changing gastroscape of NYC, the options at any given moment are nothing less than daunting. The food, mixology, staff, and atmosphere here are just that amazing. The live jazz every night is an awesome theme (as with their sister establishment Flat Iron Room) as well, although on a recent visit, the music was a little less inspiring than in the past. With so many venues in the city, the din is so overwhelming that conversation is difficult at best. Coupled with loud, obnoxious music, packed bodies, and, well we've all experienced that. At F&R, all things are civilized - not pretentious, constrained, nor stiff, just enjoyable. Â An environment where fine food and spirits can be appreciated while appreciating the company of others. If you have not had one of their smoke-infused cocktails, I highly recommend starting your evening off with one. They take it to a new level by offering several wood varietals. Not into peatiness? No problem as their breath of spirits and knowledge are jaw-dropping. They have something for every palate. Their Mezcal collection was another recent surprise: I always knew about their extensive American, Scotch, and Japanese whiskey holdings - but, like 10 Mezcals? I'm stayin! The food - well, it pairs perfectly with everything else. On our last visit, we were a party of 8. We opted for a varied pre-selected menu.

They helped me find a scotch I really enjoyed that I would not have otherwise ever planned to try. I would give the staff 5 stars. The atmosphere with the live music on a Saturday night in the middle of Covid was amazing... made you forget there is a pandemic going on. It was on the louder side so having a conversation with all 4 of us was difficult but it was nice to have live music. The reason I only give this place 3 stars is because the food was not very good. I went with 4 people and all of us were disappointed in our dishes. The steak I got had good seasoning but it was very tough. When I spend $40 plus on a steak I don't want to have to chew each bite 15 times or have to saw through it with the knife. My girlfriend has an allergy and we asked for the carrots to be served on a separate plate they put them on the same plate as the steak.

The servers are very attentive and always cleared used plates and cutlery quick. I definitely recommend the oysters and other items from the raw bar. They were very fresh. I had gotten the paella. It was filled with seafood and well seasoned, but the rice was a bit watery. I would recommend a different entree since there are better places for paella. I got the Fine and Rare Sphere. If you love desserts on the sweeter side, I would recommend it. The dessert was great and very good in the beginning, but it was a bit too sweet halfway through. I would have preferred the sphere to be made of dark chocolate and the liquid chocolate to the dark chocolate as well. This is my personal preference. It is a great take on a classic American dessert nonetheless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Patrice C.,/user_details?userid=CgOWFQYnmLkIDPqji0w0Xw,"Manhattan, NY",5/5/2018,3.0,I took a friend here for her birthday. I'd been before with a large group and quite liked the drinks. The live music is great and the songstress belted our some heartfelt tunes. My back was to the stage but my friend enjoyed it. We opted not to drink and just had dinner. I got the bolognese and she tried the fish (I think it was bass?). She liked it but didn't love it. I didn't try it as it was sitting on a bed of veggies which included bloody onions. My dish was fine. The pasta was a good consistency but the sauce left a lot to be desired. I actually put hot sauce in it to give it some flavour and that is blasphemy. Sigh. I really wanted to like it. We then had the creme brÃ»lÃ©e which was the winner of the night. There were flecks of vanilla bean which leant it some complexity and bits of fruit on top. All in all I'd rate the dessert a 6/10 and the food 3.5/10 so average-ish. One nice touch is I mentioned to the waiter when I ordered the creme brÃ»lÃ©e that it was my friends birthday and he brought out extra desert offerings with a candle. We really appreciated it (too bad the taste wasn't there). The two dishes and one dessert came out to 100 after tip. So meh. At least there's live music?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ali V.,/user_details?userid=FoeaygeTK_TLc_YT9oWcaQ,"New York, NY",2/15/2018,4.0,"This place was very full at 7:30pm on a Saturday. There would have been no room if we wanted a table for dinner without a reservation. We got seats at the bar, which gave us a nice view of the stage. There were two different jazz bands that came on that evening. Besides my friend and me, there was an older couple who seemed like regulars sitting at the bar, a young man having a drink alone, and a group of friends standing around and chatting. The tables seemed to be mostly filled with couples. The music was nice, and was quiet enough that people could still have conversations. They had a great selection of whiskeys, and the bartender had a lot of information about each of them. It looked like someone would climb up on a ladder when people ordered less-common drinks that weren't kept in the main bar area. I was served my 1792 Sweet Wheat Bourbon from the flask, and given a glass with water, a glass with ice, and an eyedropper to add water more carefully.

Â We had to get up out of our seats and move our chairs and ourselves out of the way each time the performers had to get on or off, take intermission, or move their instruments on or off the stage. Â This happened at least 6 times between the two bands performing. We weren't there long enough for the 2nd band's intermission; otherwise, we would've had to move at least 3-4 more times factoring in the intermission and the end of the 2nd set. Â To add insult to injury, two of us were pushed back into the alcove such that we could not see the stage or performers at all.

Â  Got there around 5:30 and they already had performers on the stage. The cocktails here are quite good. They don't come cheap but cocktails are made very well. We had the Ginger Brenner House, Highlander, a flight of Scotch Explorer, and the Smokey Old Fashioned. As for food, I would skip it. The pork chop we ordered was on the tough side but acceptable. However the sides, truffle fries and French lentils were subpar. We told the staff about the non truffle tasting truffle fries and they took it back to the kitchen. When they brought it back, I thought there would be some hint of truffle taste. There was NONE. So we didn't eat any fries. Onto the French lentils. One word. BLAND. We asked for the manager and brought this up with her. She apologized and made things right. Â I would prob stick with cocktails and music but nevertheless service was great and they did what they had to in order to smooth things over. I would def come back for the music and the cocktails. The two different groups playing were quite good. The first group was better but the second wasn't bad either. The cocktails were done right. Our Scotch flight was presented well. They brought six glasses and then a caddy with all the Scotch to be poured. The guy pouring was pretty knowledgeable and we had a good flight!

For our main course he had the paella which he said was ok, not great, and I had the Greek grain bowl which was 80% quinoa and had hardly any beans. They also ran out of tofu when I was there. So basically we paid $20 for a huge bowl of quinoa. The ambience is very weird. When the jazz band wasn't playing, they had songs that sounded like techno/electronic music blasting.

I loved the casual but intimate vibe of the restaurant and was amazed by the kindness of the staff. We ordered calamari, fries and karaage for the table, which were all pretty good! I ordered the pork Katsu curry and a shishito pepper skewer. The pork was a little dry and the curry needed a little more flavor but I still enjoyed my dish! And the skewer was well seasoned and pretty good. We brought a cake for my friend and the staff was kind to give us a candle and bring the cake out for us.

Michelle L.,/user_details?userid=rHsJwS_bumZz4lsCDzmVIw,"Manhattan, NY",5/27/2022,1.0,"I wanted to visit this place after seeing it on Instagram so many times, so I finally made the trip here and as soon as I got to the entrance I could not even tell if I was at the right location. Just from looking on the outside you can tell that this place is not authentic Japanese food -- it looked more like a Chinese restaurant with Japanese food. Upon walking in, the smell of bleach and dishwashing soap hit my face and I already wanted to leave but it was too late because my friend had already been waiting for me inside for 20 minutes and we felt bad for leaving. We ended up ordering 3 skewers and it came out to around $18 I believe....so not worth it. The skewers weren't bad but its overpriced and nothing special or authentic about it. The service here also is not the greatest, I called to ask if they accept reservations and the person who picked up the phone immediately went ""NO RESERVATION"" a millisecond after I finished my sentence. And when I asked if only walk-ins are available they quickly replied as if they were in a rush. Funny though because when I walked into the restaurant it was basically empty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ai-ki-ya-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Liuting Z.,/user_details?userid=izSbgCQy4fRBSPviy8MwRA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/24/2021,4.0,A new Japanese spot at Ktown. I have to say that sukiyaki is a little more expensive than I expected (59 for 2). It says that we have to place at least 2 orders (1 order for 1 person). BUT the beef inside the pot was so little.... I think I only got 3 bites.... It would be much better if they put enough ingredients into the pot. I added beef intestine which is pretty cool! I recommend this place because the flavor is good and I like how they use marshmallow to add sweetness to the sukiyaki pot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ai-ki-ya-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The best part was the drink I got the Tokyo night I think it's called that was so good. For food I got the pork gyoza that was okay but the problem was the Oyakodon. The chicken was a bit slimy but the rice was just mushy.

I waited there 20 minutes as I watched three (!) walk ins order and leave with their food. I wasn't particularly mad but wondering if my order fell thru the cracks so I nicely asked the counter person there (a tall, curly haired dude named Jonathan) if my order was coming up. He responds to check my phone of the pick up time, which turned out to be in a few minutes, to which he responds, ""Well that's when it will be ready."" Â How rude and unsympathetic! Finally when the order does arrive, three minutes before closing, I decide to have one rice ball before heading out. Seeing me opening the bento box inside the bag, Jonathan then goes on a rant about how rude I am by eating there when they are closing, then he goes to the back kitchen and passive-aggressively loudly tells whoever's there that I'm eating there because they took forever.

Perfect lunch stop. The bento box is such a good deal for the quality and how much food your get. You can pick a meat or do a tofu veg option, then you also get two sides and two rice balls of your choice. The sides range from seaweed salad, to curried cauliflower. I really enjoyed the green beans in a sesame sauce. Had a nice nutty flavor on top of the crisp beans. The rice balls were also really good! I liked how they were slightly warm and not like chilled like the rice balls you typically might find.

Hoji latte was lacking flavour and not very creamy - personally have made my own at home and had it at blue bottle which is much more rich and flavourful. The original rice ball was decent but once again did not command flavour to return for a second round.

Lana V.,/user_details?userid=h7GloVptK0mEgZo2VrPkxw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/6/2018,5.0,Well this turned out to be my favorite discovery of 2018 so far. The only places I've been able to find rice balls in so far have been in Dumbo under the archway (these guys!) and occasionally at places like Smorgasburg. Finally there's a brick and mortar rice ball restaurant! They have bento boxes with other stuff too. And it's a block from my kid's school so I'll definitely be coming by on the reg. Not only are their rice balls delicious (my fave was the tuna and mayo) but the soups are fantastic too. The simplicity and small size of the restaurant makes it even more appealing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rice-and-miso-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Stephanie P.,/user_details?userid=R8skIfMGcMRugWPUR0OBog,"Washington, DC",12/20/2022,5.0,"Glin was very good! Cute spot in Fort Greene that had a good amount of different options. To start we had the curry puffs, seafood salad, and their tom yum soup. All were great. The curry puff had great filling and was nice and flaky. The seafood salad I just loved! It had a nice subtle heat, which I really enjoyed. The tom yum had great flavor, a lot of mushrooms, and was served very hot. For our entrees we got the pad see ew with shrimp, and the massaman curry with chicken. The massaman was very good, although I do wish it was spicier. It was pretty mild in heat, which was a little bit of a disappointment. The pad see ew was alright, and leaned a little drier. I'd probably pass on ordering it when I come back.

Ariella G.,/user_details?userid=TwEwJi1_M9dQHkDK_gcNsQ,"Brooklyn, NY",6/20/2018,4.0,"I always recommend The Warren for drinks and bites in the West Village. It is perfect for meeting friends after work, a date, or a solo drink - the environment has an elevated casual feel, and while you'll see people dressed in after work clothes it manages to be fairly laid-back but also nice. I typically come during their great happy hour (which goes until 8pm) and stick to the small bites, though the larger entrees also look delicious. Get the brussels sprouts and some charcuterie to pair with one of the many wines they have available. There is also a daily punch that is worth looking in to. This is not a huge space so would not bring a large group here, but its perfect for groups of 1-4. The service is always friendly and timely, even though there are usually numerous people to attend to and only a couple of servers. I've enjoyed coming here year round: the space provides a nice reprieve from the harshness of winter while in the warmer months the windows open up allowing for you to bask in the city's full summer glory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-warren-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Flavors were all over the dishes and then i was treated to the flatbread which was crisp, fresh and full of life (could eat this all day) Loved it and will have to come back for more. The venue itself is warm and inviting and has a ""Cheers"" type feel about it. Even a Norm and Cliff at the end of the bar. The staff are friendly and attentive and also were on point.

The decor is homey and a great place to have an intimate date, drinks with your friends, and even rent it for private parties. The staff tends to your every need and are very attentive. The bartender (Sal I think) is so friendly and makes the best cocktails. The owner even came by our table several times to make sure we were content. The food was nothing but AMAZING! We had a lot of tapas and were able to try out many items from the menu. Everything on the menu has a bit of delicious twist that makes you want more of it. I personally am not an oyster eater because I have been let down so many times with the freshness and taste but I think I finished about the whole dozen. Their famous hamburger melts in your mouth as do the pork chops and the lamb chops. Everything was exceptionally fresh and you can tell that it was the highest quality of food that you were eating.

Really liked the atmosphere and the two female bartenders were very nice. The prices were more than fair. The one star review is due to what appeared to be the manager on duty. Fairly young, dark hair, bearded guy in a suit, looked the part. He single handily ruined our experience. No joke. It was slow, so he stood at the bar and talked to the two female bartenders the entire hour that we were there. The problem? He was so LOUD. A loud booming voice. And he's literally standing 5 feet from us, and 3 feet from the employees he was talking to. How did he have no sense of his own voice? I couldn't tell you. So loud it was hard for us to have a conversation. We literally looked at each other and were like, are you kidding me? On top of that he was dropping F bombs and swearing in his loud voice as well. As a manager myself, I was pretty taken aback by his unbelievable lack of common sense or professionalism. We literally cut our time there short solely because of this man. We will never be back.

Â Then our server came over to tell us that happy hour was going to end in about 40 minutes so if we wanted to order we should. Â So we ordered a frosita and a sangrita. Â We waited about 10-15 minutes and still no drinks and it seemed like our server was preoccupied with something else that they had forgotten about us. Â Another table had come in and sat down and somehow ordered drinks and got their drinks which led us to then get the attention of the host to ask where our drinks were. Â They finally brought our drinks over but I don't think the drinks were correct. Â She handed me my drink and said margarita and I was like no is this the sangrita and she was like yes. I took a sip of it and it was definitely a margarita. I couldn't be bothered with asking for another one after already waiting 15 minutes for our drink order that they just pour from a slushy like machine. Â Maybe it was an off day as they seemed to have something going on - just wished that they were a bit more attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/medusa-the-greek-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Their pita is also very good and fresh tasting. The saganaki was very tasty, though I do like when it's served very hot and soft, and that's not the case here. The octopus is good and it's a healthy serving size! Brandon and Nini were so friendly and pleasant.

We tried the dip sampler which comes with enough pita for two but enough dip for five! If you order just for two, be prepared to save the dips to slather all over your entree (which probably comes with more pita) or just get extra pita and have a dip feast! I was floored by the black truffle fish roe spread - I wish I had a huge jar of it at home to put on everything. Tzatziki was nice and thick, spicy feta was rich salty deliciousness, eggplant was fresh and smoky, and the beet hummus was light and sweet. For entrees we got the lamb platter and the salmon platter - I ordered my salmon rare and it came out perfectly. Sashimi quality in the middle! And it was a huge filet with a nice layer of skin. For sides, I preferred the spinach rice over the Brussels sprouts - it paired better with the meat and you get a delicious dill and feta salad on the side anyway so no need for more veg! Also shoutout to the pita which comes hot, soft, and doughy in the middle - could have made an entire meal off of it.

Flamur C.,/user_details?userid=rKXltExJs9eHH2TwAMxDLQ,"Brooklyn, NY",2/23/2023,3.0,"I'm giving this place 3 stars because it didn't put me over the top to justify at least 4 stars. For me to give 4 stars it would have to impress me. This review is a bit complicated because it didn't come across as a totally Greek restaurant. It had a little Spanish flair to it. If you look at the menu it has Carne Asada gyro and platter, Lamb Empanadas and Sangria. All Hispanic dishes or descriptions. The food was decent not impressive. If you're going to be a certain ethnic food restaurant then be that all the way. It's like you have an identity crisis with what you're serving. I don't know if it's because they're trying to please too many people but if I go to a certain ethnic type of restaurant then I want to experience that ethnicity's food and no side tracking. Come to find out that the owner is the same owner of two other Hispanic restaurants in the same area. So I see where they get the influence from. If you're a Greek restaurant then keep it Greek. If you're a Colombian or Mexican restaurant then keep it totally Colombian or Mexican because that's what I am there for. To experience their native cuisine. The service was good and attentive, but again, the food didn't put me over the top like the Greek restaurants in Astoria.

Chris B.,/user_details?userid=bTgP6RjnYa9lREzqpmSxYw,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",3/19/2022,4.0,"Came here for brunch with the family and had an amazing time. From the start our hostess was very friendly and accommodating. Let's us move our table outside since it was so nice out and was easier to get a proper seat for the baby joining us. Drinks were solid for a brunch spot everything you'd ordinarily expect and done well. The dip sampler is great for a group good with sharing. A lot larger portion than I had expected so plenty for everyone. Fresh crudite and pita to dip with, we ordered extra cause it was so good. Personal favorites was the spicy feta and was pleasantly surprised by the black truffle Tamara. I normally don't like truffle but this was subtle enough to not overpower the tastebuds. My only complaint is I wish they had just a regular hummus as not everyone is a fan of beets and the flavor can be a bit much. For a main I went with the brunch gyro and loved it. So much flavor, and was able to use some of the remaining spreads to create some delicious unique bites along the way. Sooooo much food though.

Jessica E.,/user_details?userid=KZXxN9-lXSp14sVL_4fqbw,"Manhattan, NY",2/3/2022,2.0,I placed an order through a food delivery app for pick up. Food was ready upon arrival. Ordered the moussaka and the squid ink truffle infused dip with a side of pita and crudite which came with a small side of greek salad in two separate containers. The moussaka was underwhelming. The layer of bechamel was thin and lacked a depth of flavor and heartiness I expected. The squid ink infused truffle dip was tasty and I would have appreciated a bit more texture. It was well infused with truffle and the pita was a good pairing to that. The reason for the rather low rating is due to finding mold on the tomato that came with the salad. It was a big turn off and I could not help but double check and wonder about the food quality for the rest of meal. Really hoping it was an off day. I will not return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/medusa-the-greek-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was passing by the other day and decided to come and eat some lamb chops. I was greeted by Juan and Lillian. (Both great people by the way.) Lillian was my waitress and was very attentive and nice. She was able to answer all my questions and trust me I had a lot. I ate the Lavraki which was so good. The one star was taken off for the wait time because I ended up waiting around 40 minutes for my food. When the waitress told me it would take longer for it to cook I didn't expect to be waiting there for 40 minutes. I then ate the chocolate mousse which was okay.

Melissa L.,/user_details?userid=I_hjjlwI9oPPKYr2oIh7gA,"Wadsworth, OH",4/4/2023,4.0,Beef and broccoli was very good. The pork soup dumplings I felt were underwhelming. They lacked flavor to me. Service wasn't great but they were fast. Forgot our rice with our meals and never checked on us. 18% added gratuity was on check for 2 people which was never stated to us.

Service was fine and they seemed like they were always in a rush, which was understandable given how busy it was. We would have to try to flag them down if we needed anything. We ordered soup dumplings, scallion pancake, and the Shanghai noodle soup. The soup dumplings were not that great to me. It was hard and doughy on the top while being dry. Other soup dumplings I had were with a clear broth on the inside but this was not. There was scum inside and it was a lot richer than others I have tried. The scallion pancake was okay but a little greasy. The Shanghai noodle soup had a lot of veggies, which I was craving for during my trip, however it was pretty bland.

Mike J.,/user_details?userid=74-j37VeRWBh7JHtfLTgCw,"Herndon, VA",4/8/2023,2.0,"So, you can say I'm one of those fools who wait an hour in line to eat great food, and Joe's is one of those few places where I will give up my precious hour to satisfy my soup dumpling craving. Â My wife and I have been coming here for 25+ years, and we have been trekking up from the WDC area a few times a year to drip our way to eat the famous soup dumplings. The dumplings have always been spot on and consistent, which is a primary key to a successful restaurant. Â  It has been over 3 years since our last visit due to the COVID pandemic, and we have final broke out of the shell to make it back to Joe's to devour the soup dumplings, and I must say, I am so heartbroken to find that the soup dumplings are NOT what it used to be. Â The dumpling skins have become thicker, the soup taste profile is a bit off, bit into more crab shells than usual, the side dish sliced ginger is not thin, and the most noticeable is the size of the dumplings is larger. Â Furthermore, the bamboo baskets are not lined with Napa cabbage, which makes the dumplings stick to the parchment paper. Â Why am I complaining about the larger sized dumplings? Â I did notice that there are considerable amounts of NEW restaurants that are serving the same style dumplings in the nearby blocks, and I can only assume that Joe's is feeling the competition. Â  With competition, Â one will always try to do bigger and better..... Â I have been in the restaurant business for over 40 years, and I can see that this is an initial sign of nervousness when they are met with fierce competition. Â I've always preached that quantity will never prevail over quality in the restaurant business. Â Quality will always create and increase repeat customers. Â I am so so sad to see the negative changes at Joe's. Â Unfortunately, last night at Joe's might have been the last.

Lisa A.,/user_details?userid=EDZKP6CGokUIoQfRmkLhdw,"Katonah, NY",2/3/2023,4.0,"Went on a Saturday night and had to wait for an hour and so we went next-door to the sushi place and had drinks. You give your name at the door and they give you what looks like a raffle ticket and they called us within the hour. The room is very brightly lit so don't expect any kind of ambience. I felt somewhat rushed, and we gave them our orders for appetizers and dinner all at once. The first dish that came out was their famous dumplings and they are just as delicious as everybody makes them out to be. They are hot and inside is a very rich broth that is a little thicker than a typical broth because of the pork fat in the dumpling. We then ordered the scallion pancakes, and they were very big and light and crispy but they did not have a lot of flavor, but the sauce that came with them made up for that. We then ordered our entrÃ©es which included crispy shredded beef, general taos shrimp, and I believe it was general tsaos chicken, as well as a spicy fish dish. The chicken was fresh and crispy and delicious and very flavorful and it came with broccoli. The crispy shredded beef was also very good but honestly, I think I can make it better at home and we also ordered the spicy fish which had an unusual flavor, which I think was an overpowering star anise which made it almost feel like it was in a curry sauce, but it wasn't. That dish went to waste because it was too spicy and the flavor was just too overwhelming. You don't get rice which I found weird and when we asked, they brought small bowls. I also ordered food to go which initially they gave me somebody else's bag but in my food order was sautÃ©ed string beans, and they were out of this world. They had ground pork in them, and they were slightly charred and had a lot of umami. Overall, I thought the place was very good and would definitely go back, but not at dinner time since it's too long of a wait but I would go back there for lunch during the week possibly early on a Saturday or Sunday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There was this place that had best soup dumplings in New York written on the side and so we had to stop in and try these dumplings. We were seated at a corner table and handed menus. It was SO hot in the restaurant. To the point that we were actually sweating just sitting there. Â The server came over and we ordered 2 beers and an order of soup dumplings. She asked what else and we said that is it. She immediately got upset and was pushing us to order more. We said we weren't really hungry and just stopped in to try these amazing dumplings. She was huffy and walked away. The dumplings came out and honestly they were pretty bad. No flavor. Super bland.

The Shanghai food from another block over with the same dishes cost half the price and tastes a lot better. Can't believe we spent over $100 only for four items. We order the pork soup dumplings of course. This was the only decent item on the menu. Then we ordered a cold dish (tofu appetizer), this was really small and can't believe it was $15, totally not worth it for the lack of tofu. Then we ordered a noodle soup with five spiced beef, the beef was r really fresh and tasty but the noodles and the soup was so bland and lack flavor. The amount of noodle was so little it wasn't even enough for a small child to be full. Finally we order the sesame chicken, this was so dry , heavy in sauce but very dry chicken on inside. This was $20 and probably Panda Express would've taste better than this. The only dish that was decent was the soup dumplings and the Rick cakes. But even rice cakes was very greasy like fast food. For the sesame chicken- They probably cooked it overnight and reheated the chicken in the morning.

Joe's Shanghai used to be a great restaurant serving authentic Shanghainese dishes but since it became very popular, the quality of their food noticeably went down in quality. We ordered XLB, crispy noodle and Peking duck. The noodle was okay, my son liked it, the CLB was decent - it was juicy but the wrapper was a little too thick - pls skip the duck it was not worth the price, the portion was small and the meat was dry, the skin was not crispy ( definitely not recommended!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jennifer H.,/user_details?userid=8pgQqEJV51ss4mlwd0xoqw,"Irvine, CA",10/10/2021,4.0,"Seeing all the reviews on Yelp plus seeing the huge line outside this restaurant makes you wonder if this place is hyped up. We came around 12:45pm, and was told the wait would be 30 minutes. However, it ended up being about 45 minutes. The inside of the restaurant was pretty nice. Menu had a variety, but nothing seemed extraordinarily special. My boyfriend and I got the pork XLB, crab XLB, the shredded turnip cakes, and the braised duck to share. The pork XLB was surprisingly good. Very large portions and filled with delicious soup. The crab XLB wasn't as good (just wasn't as tasty as the pork), and one piece had something crunchy and hard inside (maybe a shell?). The turnip cake was pretty good. I was expecting the dim sum style turnip cake, but it wasn't what I expected. It also wasn't piping hot when it came out. The appetizers were so filling that we probably didn't need any more food, but it was still nice to have tried the braised duck. The duck was so tender, and the sauce was yummy. Definitely would say the pork XLB and the braised duck would be 5/5 star quality. Note that this place is still cash only. Overall, not sure if the wait is worth it (this place should do the Yelp waitlist to improve customer satisfaction), but I did truly enjoy the pork XLB and the braised duck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

But I fear din tai fung is the industry standard and everyone else is fighting for second. I can't speak to any of the dishes here other than the xiao long bao which Joe's is known for and the only dish I ordered. Xiao long bao are soup dumplings, one of only a handful of items I can order in Chinese and one of my favorite foods in life that I openly seek when traveling. The line is long; as in 45 minutes to an hour in off hours like 330pm. The soup dumplings are good, but they skin is too thick and the meat filling is under seasoned and the broth while maintaining a tastiness that coats your lips, lacks depth and richness in flavor.

In my ranking of New York City soup dumplings, the XLBs here might not be #1 but definitely rank within the top 3.

The soup dumplings were really BIG, flavorful and freshly made. On the other hand, their house crispy chicken was fair. Nothing spectacular at all. One thing we immediately noticed when the dish came out, was the pool of oil (canola) at the bottom of the dish. The sauce tasted very commercial and full of MSG! For the price of the meal ($40) we didn't think it was worth it and kept talking about how many delicious dishes we could have gotten had a e gone somewhere else.

I knew something was off when I arrived at the location and the staff told me and my friend 20 minute wait. We walked away for four minutes than all of a sudden our table was ready when nobody left. Very fishy, almost like they said that to dissuade us to not dine here. The soup dumplings were at a inflated price because Joe makes a killing on tourists or people that never had Shanghai food. None of the dishes that were soup dumplings would stand a chance to be sold by themselves. Insider Food did an interview with Joe and he said that his soup dumplings have 30 pleats good and on average chefs have 26 pleats. Well it's clear Joe doesn't work in the Chinatown one because there was 22 pleats when I went. The best surprise of the whole experience is when they charged me for 2 whole orders of crab meat soup dumplings when I ordered one pork, and one order of half pork / crab meat.

Â These are really what they say: Â Dumplings with soup in them. Â With each bite I had it all over me, as well as on the table. Â Unfortunately, the table looked like a crime scene when it was all said and done. Â When we were leaving, I watched a local eat them, and went ""OHHHHH"". Â Do yourself a favor and look it up :). Â Also, we ordered crab ones, and they were super fishy. Â Wasn't a huge fan. Â This place is cash only, and didn't have a super great vibe. Â To top it off, there was a lady in the corner staring at us. Â Very strange.

Marlin S.,/user_details?userid=Wo1u_Nahqn8LQGhvP8EMKg,"Atlanta, GA",10/19/2020,5.0,Best Chinese in NY I go here every time I come to NYC. Make sure you get the dumplings when you come. Also the line is long so be patience did I spell that right? Very reasonably priced and service is fast once you finally sit down. They also sit you with other people which was fine with me.

It's nice and hot which makes it perfect for a cold day but it still tastes delicious when the weather is warmer, it's worth overheating for in the hot restaurant. I tried the cold noodles and it was way too peanut buttery; it literally tasted like noodles mixed with just peanut butter you get from jars.

The trick I use is to reach the restaurant at 11 exactly when they opens. Probably soup dumplings is the only things you should have here. I stuff myself with just the dumplings. There is a crab and pork version and a pork only version. Both are almost equally good. I felt the crab and pork version has a slight edge (very slight).

Carrie L.,/user_details?userid=86ifg4FDR9qylC6l6fL45A,"New York, NY",1/9/2021,5.0,"I had an excellent time dining at the new location since covid. The staff were extremely clean and courteous, wait list must wait outdoors. Indoors the tables were appropriately distanced and the food was excellent. We enjoyed pork soup dumplings, turnip radish cake, scallion pancake, hot and sour soup for 2, eggplant with pork in garlic sauce, Tsing Tao beers, sake, hot tea, & pan fried noodles with fresh shrimp. Â All were delicious. We noticed a nearby table ordered the crispy whole fish in garlic sauce and we will try next! The eggplant in spicy garlic sauce was to die for. The pan fried noodles were tasty and crispy with fresh shrimp. The hot and sour soup was delicious full of vegetables and flavor. I love their scallion pancake and of course, the pork soup dumplings! The portions are huge so expect to share! Tip is included in the bill and oranges for dessert are brought complimentary. There is a reason I have been coming here for 10 years and we still love it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Although this review is old because I went about 3-4 years ago I insist you try this place. Again, before my travels I start to research what locations have good tasting food based on reviews and this one had so many. It's literally some where in china town hole in the wall place , but worth it! Worth the wait and everything I came here for some pork soup buns I think called Xiao Bao best purchase in my life I can still remember the taste up until this day! Just amazing every thing was delicious. The ambiance is also interesting we waited for our turn to sit and we got sat with a group of other people that we did not even know in the same table which was interesting to me, but since the volume of people and their set up is big round table and or squared ones they seat you as it becomes available according to how many you have in your party.

I haven't found a good green onion pancake anywhere but LA so I'm happy to finally find one that isn't one dense piece. The service is efficient and they timed our dishes well while constantly refilling our drinks. Their fried calamari could use a little more seasoning in my opinion but other than that it was fried well. The spicy beef noodle soup had a delicious flavor, the broth wasn't overly salty and it had a nice kick of spice and flavor from the cilantro.

Adrienne V.,/user_details?userid=5zphaOc5bx64WxQHDu7vKQ,"San Diego, CA",1/12/2019,5.0,"Out of this world amazing soup dumplings. One of the best meals I've ever had. My friend and I showed up about an hour early because we were told the wait can get crazy but we were still the only ones by the time they were open. We got an order of soup dumplings and an order of on fried dumplings. The soup dumplings were big and sooo juicy. The soup inside was so damn flavorful, it was like WOW xlb's can taste this good?! They were really big so equal parts fantastic and tricky. I feel like with soup dumplings you have to get them in one bite to do it right so that's quite the big bite. Pan fried pork dumplings were really tasty too but pales in comparison to the xlb.

Matt B.,/user_details?userid=F2R-y69dCJlTiXS0NcElDQ,"New York, NY",2/5/2019,5.0,"Joe's Shanghai is incredible. Period. There's generally a crowd of people waiting outside, so be prepared to wait. That being said, me and a dear friend went on Saturday around 7:30pm, were told that we'd have to wait 30 minutes or an hour (which are pretty different times?), but then we were seated in 10 minutes which was a great surprise! Soup dumplings are a must here, so we made sure to start with those. The scallion pancake is also one of the best I've ever had, as is the sesame chicken. I would also highly recommend the Shanghai noodles. Make sure you take out cash beforehand, but also prepare to be excited by the generally cheap prices for amazing food at Joe's Shanghai.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friends and I got the pork soup dumplings and the crab meat and port meat soup dumplings and both of them were equally amazing! It was the prefect soup to meat to dumpling ratio. The soup in the dumpling was very rich and flavorful. We also ordered the spicy salt and pepper prawns and it was delicious, the prawns were juicy and not dry at all and the shell was coated with so much flavor. This dish can get too salty depending on where you order it from but not here! It was just the right amount of salt. Another dish we really enjoyed was the chef's recommended spicy schezuan style fish filet...this dish was sooo amazing. I've tried this same dish at other Cantonese/Chinese restaurants but Joe's Shanghai tops all. The shrimp friend rice was super good as well and paired nicely with the main dishes and was flavorful while not being overpowering.

Celena C.,/user_details?userid=NwDNwZcnEVcdrsTXtZiYSA,"Manhattan, NY",6/3/2019,4.0,"Food here tasted great, but flavors were ordinary--nothing really stood out for me. We ordered all 3 kinds of xiao long baos (chicken, pork, and crab), green onion pancake, green beans, eggplant, and chicken fried rice. Between the chicken and pork xiao long baos, I could not tell which was which. My favorite type would be the crab meat xiao long bao. The filling had a bit more flavor, was juicier, and was slightly saltier. Unfortunately, the xiao long baos all broke easily. Almost everyone broke theirs when they were picking the dumplings out of the basket. The other dishes were good as well. We saw that a lot of people on Yelp recommended the chicken fried rice, so we ordered it. It tasted like what a typical well-made chicken fried rice should taste like. Overall, I would return to Joe's Shanghai, as it seems like I can rely on it to serve delicious Chinese food. In other words, you probably cannot go wrong with anything you order here.

I'm a huge critic when it comes to food and I can honestly tell you that Joe's Shanghai is amazing! The wait was a bit long and kept getting longer, but that's okay given how great the meal was. The standout dishes for me were the pork soup dumplings and the sesame chicken. Both the crab and pork soup dumplings were good, very different, but still good. The better one was for sure the pork dumplings, however. The broth was rich and flavorful as was the meat. They were a favorite amongst the whole family. Now, I'm afraid to have soup dumplings from anywhere else because I doubt any other restaurant can top my experience at Joe's Shanghai. I'm hoping to be able to get my hands on some frozen ones if they ship to other states. The soup dumplings were life-changing and I would recommend them 100 times over!!

It's known for its soup dumplings and fresh food. It has changed so much over the years and I'm so dissapointed. Unfortunately it's definitely not know for its service or cleanliness. It was Chinese New year so I decided to go. I was always willing to take the bad service for good food. Now you will wait for 15-20 minutes to get a small cup of white rice that comes with your meal. If you need any question answered you can forget about it. The most disturbing thing of all is how terribly dirty the place is. Unbearably filthy. The walls right next to the table were filthy and the bathroom smelled like a sewer.

We were only 2 and we're sat with others in a round table, that didn't bother us at all, it's cool. We got vegetable, soup dumplings, and noddles.

You are sat down in a big round table with multiple of people, and there is much space for you or the plates. I found myself feeling pretty crowded. As soon as I got up to leave that's when i noticed how hunched over in a corner I was. The noodles are great and so is the sesame pancake (serves 2). The soup dumplings are good but most of them break before getting them onto the plate because they're all stuck together, I was pretty disappointed because by the time you got the soup dumpling onto your plate there was no soup in your dumpling because it would break apart on the dish, no matter how careful you are.

They were still working on getting their liquor license as of 12/25, but it's a pretty basic selection of beers. That's not the reason you're here. The real reason is absolutely the soup dumplings. I had never eaten them before so I popped the first one into my mouth and scalded the entire thing. After I figured it out I was able to enjoy them and found myself wishing I had 24-36 more to eat. This was followed up by the general Tso's chicken which was without a doubt the best I have had.

I grew up on Chinese food so my expectations are probably much higher than most. The wait was just a little over an hours which I did not mind waiting for good food. You must go inside to grab a ticket from one of the staff to be put on the list and receive a wait time! We had to share a table with other guests, which was a little uncomfortable but I completely understand due to their high volume. The staff weren't very attentive. I had to ask for water several times b efore he got it for me. I recommend getting what they are known for which is the soup dumplings. They were juicy and delicious but you much eat them right away! The stir fry noodle were good as well, had a chard flavor from the wok. But the beef noodle soup was terrible! There was literally no flavor. It just tasted like hot water tbh. Idk if that's a mistake or that's how they normally make it but I would never order that again. The sweet and sour fried fish was good. But the strong ketchup taste ruined it.

Jennifer J.,/user_details?userid=AuMf0RrdCJpZILNVeQAPUQ,"Skokie, IL",7/11/2018,4.0,We came for their highly recommended and famous soup dumplings! They were delicious we ordered the pork meat ones. This was our first time having soup dumplings. The order comes with 8 which was more than enough to fill my boyfriend and I up. We also ordered their scallion pancake which was really crispy. I was expecting them to have more scallions as the flavor to me seemed a little washed out. We also ordered a Shanghai fried rice for the both of us but after the scallion pancake and soup dumplings we shared it was just way too much food and ended up taking the rice to go. Joe's Shanghai is a very sought after place with limited table seating. We ended up sharing a 7 person table with 2 other parties which was a little awkward. I wish we had been able to get our own table. And the seating arrangement also made it even more cramped to fit everyone's food on the table with enough room to move around.

We were told it would be a 20 minute way but they were able to accommodate us practically right away. The big line had not started building up yet but by the time we left, there was a crowd waiting to get in. I haven't been to this location in years but friends were in town from Seattle and we decided to go for soup dumplings. They were very delicious and bigger than a lot of other soup dumplings I've had lately. They did seem to stick to the cabbage a bit and I lost some luscious broth! Â Oh, let me say that the service was very fast. Not surprising since they have to get you in and out. With that said, we never felt rushed. We ordered the dumplings, Peking Style Spicy Noodles, sautÃ©ed string beans and s&p spicy Shrimp (shell on). All were delicious. My only comment was that the spicy noodles were too salty and too saucy. They could add more noodles, less sauce and this dish would have been so much better. And they would make more money per dish by just coating the noodles with this sauce rather than drowning the noodles in the sauce. It was equivalent to hoisin sauce with some heat. That was the only dish I wish was a little better. Oranges at the end which was nice and refreshing. The hand towelettes were a nice bonus too.

Wanting H.,/user_details?userid=_LO6FEx4GtkDE2Fzp9NejA,"San Diego, CA",6/19/2018,5.0,"I heard a lot of good things about Joe's Shanghai, especially their famous Xiao Long Bao! Their authentic soup dumpling is the reasonable why we wanted to stop by and check it out. When we first arrived, we were expecting a long waiting line but we didn't see any. I thought they are closed today but turned out we were just lucky! We came in and sat down right the way around 1145. Highly recommend to come early for lunch on a weekday!!! With just two of us, we ordered the best dishes on their menu, Crab Flavored Shanghai Xiao Long Bao and Shanghai stir fried thick noodle. Omg! I love their food! So authentic that literally brought me back to the time I was visiting Shanghai!!! The stir fried thick noodles was perfectly cooked, flavorful, and just the way it should be. The crab flavored Xiao long Bao came as it finished in the bamboo steamed basket. So fresh and simply awesome. The size is bigger than I expected. The flavor and quality were also better than I expected. The crab flavored filling and soup in the Xiao long Bao were the one of the best that I've ever had! I was totally shocked by the flavor of Xiao long Bao!

Famous soup dumplings had good soup, but meat wasn't the freshest I've ever had. The skin was more doughy than should be and not the lighter consistency it should be.

The dumpling skin is thin and the soup is very flavorful and the bits of pork inside it makes this dumpling so perfect. When it's very hot I usually poke a small hole in the dumpling and pour out the soup on the spoon and mix a splash of vinegar. I also really like the fried dumplings, and the Shanghai Fried Rice. In the fried rice, they have broccoli, eggs, and some scallions. It sounds plain but it taste amazing. The wait is long and as soon as you sit down the waiters will ask you how many orders of dumplings you want and they come arrive very fast-usually about 5 minutes.

We ordered their oh so famous shanghai dumplings, green beans, Shanghai noodles and some other dishes. Their dumpling's skin is way too thick and the soup base is way too oily. It looks like I smeared Vaseline across my lips - not sexy. I can honestly say it was one of the worst dumpling's I've had. My grandma steams better ones from prepackaged store bought XLBS.

Donny Z.,/user_details?userid=ddakqQpCHImpMAKVKhAUIA,"Novi, MI",8/17/2018,4.0,I came where because of what I heard from others and the plentiful Zugat awards the restaurant has received. My family and I ordered 2 different types of soup dumplings - the pork dumpling and the crab dumping. The dumplings were delicious and so was the soup inside. One thing I recommend is not to order to much. We ordered about 6 trays for 8 people and that was way too much. I believe most people can eat around 3-6 dumplings before you are tired of it so order wisely.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friend and his family are from Shanghai and they think that Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings are better than the ones back home, so that's saying something.

Joe's XLB are widely known for a reason. They're tasty! Richly flavored pork with meaty broth. I'm obsessed with their basic pork XLB, much more than the crab ones. Each order comes with about 8. I could order so many orders and it wouldn't break the bank. This is on my list of cheap eats! We didn't get a chance to try their other dishes, but our fellow guests at the communal table ordered much more than we did and it all looked and smelled fantastic. The communal tables aren't as awkward and uncomfortable as you think. These tables are huge! Everyone minds their own business and you can barely hear others' conversations. The service is so fast, which is great. Their logistics and organisation surprises me. There were no unhappy customers. If you're new to soup dumplings, this is a great place to start.

Christopher A.,/user_details?userid=ItVUwyDjmjIlZuLvnOM-Uw,"Seattle, WA",10/26/2018,4.0,"We came here because of all the great reviews and our craving to visit Chinatown! We were lucky enough to have our party of 3 seated fairly quickly. However, this place does get really busy so be prepared to wait and have your whole party with you. If you ever visit this restaurant you HAVE TO try their xaio long bao (soup dumpling). In my opinion, and the opinion of many on here, the dumplings are one of the dishes they do extremely well. If you enjoy those soup dumplings from Din Tai Fung, these are an upgrade from those. Their house special fried rice was also very delicious and paired well with the XLB. Their fried chicken was okay. I also tried their braised carp belly. It was tasty but be prepared to fish out those tiny/big bones. The minced corn soup was not the greatest. In the end, I gave this place 4/5 stars mainly because of the great dumplings, fried rice and good service but subpar other dishes. Also to note, this place is cash only and they automatically add 15% tip, so be prepared.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sara M.,/user_details?userid=YMrua01AxoWPttElX5bu7Q,"New York, NY",12/6/2020,5.0,"Ordered delivery on UberEats and was unsure how it would be after the lengthy delivery. It was great! The food arrived and was still very hot & everything tasted as if it was in the restaurant. The hot&sour soup was delicious and very hot (it didn't even need to be heated up in the microwave). We ordered two orders of the soup thinking we would each have one... I don't recommend doing that unless you want a ton of leftovers. One order of the hot & sour soup can easily provide 2.5 servings. The spring rolls were also good and were still crispy (somehow they didn't get soggy with the delivery). We also ordered shrimp fried rice that was a pretty large portion and very good. The shrimp fried rice was not dry at all and hit the spot. The sesame chicken was still crispy and perfect... Joe's thought of a great method to deliver the sesame chicken (they cut out a hole in the plastic lid so the condensation didn't cause the chicken to get soggy) and it worked so well. The entire meal tasted just as good as in the restaurant. Overall, this meal was AMAZING! We are already talking about our next order.

For a Shanghainese who had countless authentic soup dumplings in SH, the ones served in Joe's Shanghai is very very mediocre. Their pork and crab filling does taste more fresh than your other options in Chinatown. However, the size of the soup dumpling was what had me shook. One equals two of those in Shanghai! They are way too big. The pleating was not done nicely either. The worst part was the skin. Their skin were way too thick and unenjoyable to chew on. I tried their other auth Chinese food as well. Either was too oily or had loads of MSG added. The restaurant makes you sit with complete strangers.

That, my friends, is a recipe for a legit Chinatown experience. By luck, our party of 3 was seated right away in a full house on a Tuesday at 7:30pm. We got 3 orders of XLB, an order of scallion pancakes, and the shrimp fried rice cakes. Soup dumplings have just the right consistency--skin breaks with the slightest puncture so handle them with some TLC before chomping down. I recommend ordering each round individually to maximize the freshness of the dumplings. The scallion pancakes were a bit drier than expected, but nothing too unpleasant. With the best for last, the shrimp fried rice cakes are a must-try. Generous portion size with a plethora of rice cakes, right amount of shrimp & mushrooms, and minimal veggies.

Our neighbors had a dish I hadn't seen on the menu that we decided to try which was amazing. Ask for beef or pork rice cakes. My only complaints are they really try to hussle you out and it's overpriced for Chinese food (they charge for the rice). We split around three dishes for three people and it came out to $21 each. The fact that they carry Tsingdao makes up for it. Oooo also make sure to order the eggplant (qiezi).

We would not have known how to eat them had we not been seated at an 8 top with a party of 6 Japanese tourists who seemed to know how to enjoy these pockets of fun. You use the soup spoon to take them out of the large bamboo steamer, pour the black vinegary sauce sitting on the table over them, then use your chopsticks to puncture them and let the rich broth drip onto your spoon. YUM! We also had some noodles that our waiter 9not the nicest guy on the planet) claimed to be the special (first ones on the menu) and they were good, not mindblowing. A couple of Shing Tao beers and that was enough food for the both of us.

While these might not be the hallmarks of comfort dining, to me, they are the hallmarks of everything I want to see and experience in a restaurant deep in the heart of Chinatown. Joe's Shanghai is one of those restaurants that may be hidden in an ally but is not hidden from the people that know the deliciousness that it serves. The lines are always out the door and it is a beehive of activity. What is so good about this place you say? Soup dumplings I tell ya! Joe's Shanghai definitely does soup dumplings, AKA Xiao Long Bao, justice that many other places do not. Often times you get these semi-shrunken soupless dumplings at a lot of places. But here, be prepared to scald the inside of your mouth because these dumplings are packed with soup. Each dumpling comes out hot and fresh in baskets of 8, all nice and plump. The skins are so pleasantly thin that when you pick up the dumplings, you are so afraid that you'll pierce the skin and lose the soup before it gets into your mouth. But, for such a thin skin, it actually holds up remarkably well. It keeps everything encapsulated so that when you bite it, the soup gushes out in a glorious hot burst. The meat and filling on the inside is deliciously tender and most and complements the skin and soup so well. Sure, you may burn your mouth, but for the delicious flavors that you well experience, the pain is worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I have came here in the winter before on a weekend night and waited an hour and a half outside because of how popular this place is, so plan accordingly. The tables are shared so unless you have a big group you'll probably be seated at the same table as another group but it's never bothered me. The place is definitely loud inside because of how busy it is, so not a great date night place. We always order the pork soup dumplings and crispy beef which are outstanding every time. The dishes are a bit on the pricier side ($17.95 for crispy beef) but worth every penny. The place is also cash only and tip is automatically added.

The food is typical Chinese, I loved the Sesame Chicken. They are famous for their steamed dumplings, crab or pork. I'm not very adventurous when it comes to Chinese food but taste of the crab dumplings was better than the appearance. We would probably order the pork next time. Â The restaurant has home small tables and some larger and they will seat you family style if there is no exact seat match for your party. Not a big deal since most of the patrons are Asian you can get an idea of what is good on the menu. Â It's a fun place in Chinatown to bring NYC first timers.

Lastly we ordered the king pao chicken which was absolutely terrible. The chicken was so shady... it wasn't spicy... barely any flavor. Just not worth it. I gave this place 3 stars because of the longest wait I've ever experienced, where we sat (right next to the trash and dirty dishes and a couple that was as hardcore fighting), and the fact that I can find amazing dumplings at other spots. Enjoyed it but not moved.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Â There are certainly better places to go these days, especially since it's pretty much overrun by tourists now, but this place will always be a reliable old standby. Â Given the plethora of Shanghai restaurants with soup dumplings out there, Joe's dumpling skins are pretty rough by comparison, but the super savory soup more than makes up for it. Â That's some high quality msg they must use to achieve that level of umami. If there weren't so many tourists crammed in here, I'm sure I'd go more often.

The seat is communal style, so if you come with a smaller group, or two or three people, you will probably share a table with others. Which is totally fine and actually adds to the experience in my opinion. My personal favorite thing to eat here are the pork soup dumplings, however everything else is great. There's usually a wait cause it's a popular spot, but if you go there earlier than you'd ideally like to eat, you can deal with that. It's in the heart of chinatown down a little crowded alley, and you really get the full experience being there.

We ordered 3 orders or the crab xiao long bao and 2 of the pork xiao long bao. They came out piping hot, which was great! Unfortunately, many of the xiao long baos (I'd say over half of our order) was broken so all the soup leaked out before they even touched our plates :( They were bigger than the ones I've had at Din Tai Fung, but the quality wasn't there. Other than the rude receptionist that seated us, the service inside was okay. Something to note is that they already add on tip to your bill so double check and make sure you don't double tip (unless you want to, then you're welcome to do that! :) ).

I am currently reviewing and rating for 3 stars until I go again next time so I may update this in the future. My order consisted of the crabmeat & pork soup dumplings, regular pork soup dumplings, eggplant in garlic sauce, and a side of rice. My dumplings came out very hot and tasty but over cooked and they became dry when they got to my table. The eggplant and garlic sauce dish was also very hot and tasty, but lacked that Shanghainese spice and kick I am accustomed to. I suppose it's become a very Americanized establishment to better suit a wider range of patrons. It's great that the waiters all speak English, are very quick, easy to flag down, and check up on you often. The place is cash only, a little inconvenient but it keeps the prices low. The bathroom is also decent compared to some other bathrooms in Chinatown, but would appreciate it if they were better kept. Also there is no hook on the door for a coat and bag (I was heading out with my belongings and I had all my things with me so it's important to have a hook to use lol).

A couple came right after and sat on the same table. I didn't expect that but my friend told me that the place is set up like that. I ordered what my friend recommend which was crab soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. About 8 dumplings come in a plate. Both were so delicious. It was my first time trying both and I really enjoyed it. The price is also affordable.

Other places in NYC make thinner dumplings, so they tear easily when you try to lift them with your chopsticks and put it in the spoon. Can't go wrong with Joe's so don't bother trying other places, but make sure you get there early or late as the wait is long. Oh, and don't forget to get the string beans and chow fun fried rice as it's very good as well.

Came in and saw that we were sharing a table with 3 other people, no worries, that's fine. At this point, we were already starving. Decided to order the Shanghai flat noodles, which was good BUT I must add...this dish was quite oily. Literally, each strand slithers into your mouth without any suction - kid you not. Next, we ordered the crab and pork dumplings...alright, I've been to a few XLB restaurants back in California so I know what good XLB taste like. As they set the order of the dumplings, I noticed half of them already had their juices popped!!!! No need to use the silver tong, use your chopsticks so you don't burst the soup, but no need for that since it was already spilled all over the lettuce -___- This place is hyped up, not a fan at all and will not be coming back.

Zachary A.,/user_details?userid=JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Austin, TX",6/10/2019,5.0,"With all the hype, Joe's really could've fell hard. But I was really impressed by the authenticity, the quick and friendly service, and the overall operation. Menu large and hits every American's taste buds as well as more traditional Chinese offerings. Waiters work fast but offer opinions on favorites and best ofs. I ordered quick and had sake, crab soup dumpling, cold sesame noodle, and soup pancake. Everything was good and I left still burping and tasting the meal (in a good way). Pancake essentially a latke Â with some chives and had a great dipping sauce. But dipping it in the sesame noodle sauce worked well as well. Speaking of sesame noodle, the quantity is something else. They really pile high and soak it in the sauce. Pro tip is to add tons of chili sauce. Perfect noodles and a nice change of pace from the entirely hot meal from food to tea. The soup dumplings are as good as advertised. Â Quite big and not too fishy so good for even the anti-fish eaters. Sauce overly vinegary for me but others seemed to like it. But in all the dumplings had such thick skin but a bounce to them that is just so rare and a perfect sight. Cash only but again super cheap for the quality and quantity. Definitely will get busy but come on weekday and you can sneak in under 20 minutes. Only complaint is the communal tables regardless of numbers (all seat 4 or 6) but I guess it's a family type of restaurant so makes sense so seat big rather than bars or tiny areas. Joe's lives up to the hype and is well well worth the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Been a fan for about 5 years however I was very disappointed on my last trip when I saw their C grading. For a place that stays constantly busy and makes money they should really have their health inspection as one of their priorities. Having worked in a restaurant I know that there can be a range of things that can get you from an A to a B, such as leaving an ice scoop in the ice maker or leaving boxes of products on the floor instead of on a shelf. However it looks like their offenses were much greater than that such as roaches and vermin prone environments. There are certain things I can look past however for now Joe's won't be getting my business until they think about practicing safe food handling as much as getting my money. A quick Google search will give you the information you need, Joe's Shanghai health inspection grade C report results.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We could tell all customers were out of town tourists. Belatedly we found out they do not accept credit card so our menu selections were limited. We chose Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings, aka Pork Steamed Buns (the main motivation of our visit) and String Bean, a typical Szechuan style vegetable dish. Â We found the steamed dumplings larger in size than the usual, dainty ones we had tasted elsewhere. After eating 2 orders of these, we concluded that they were excessively soupy (watch out for plenty hot liquid squirting out at first bite) and doughy. The string beans were average.

Â I took my husband here during our recent trip and he was hooked. Â We also ordered the braised pork and the snow pea shoots. Â Both were good but the real stars here are the crab soup dumplings.

They can be found on the appetizers portion of the menu. We had the pork dumplings and the crab/pork dumblings as well as a cold appetizer; chicken with vermicelli. Athe dumplings were the most flavourful i've had and my girlfirend went crazy over them. The vermicelli and chicken was not amazing but still passed as ""really good"" to us both. Servers were sort of unfriendly but they had a full house and managed to serve us very quickly and efficiently.

My fave place would be Nan Xiang in Flushing for it but since I was in Ctown, I decided to come here. One thing I hate about this place is that it's filled with tourists usually, where tour buses would bring them here which I find pretty annoying. Next, they love to make you share tables which is what happened to me last night. Had to share with 3 other groups on a big table. For 2 people, we ordered 2 orders of soup dumplings. shanghai noodles and a pork chop noodle soup. I used to love this place back in the days but I feel like some things have gone down hill for sure.

Scallion pancakes were good... but don't expect to be blown out of the water because it's just your average greasy scallion pancake ($2.95). The soup dumplings were SO good. Make sure to eat it with a broth spoon so you can drink all the soup broth from the dumpling. I can't tell you if I liked the crab or just pork better, so I recommend getting both!

The outside part of the dumping was just a little to thick for me but that didn't take away from how good those dumping's were. Fried rice and pork chops were like any other place but still good. Tables were a little too small for all the food we ordered but keep in mind the restaurant is not very big.

Tilde T.,/user_details?userid=G82q2_LYi4ghCvPLdTgUlA,"Hayward, CA",9/5/2016,5.0,I had a great experience here. Â Found them on yelp and just so happened to be really popular. Â Always expect a wait but it is so much worth it and if you have a small party you will be sharing a table with another small party. Â A little awkward but it's all part of the experience. Â My favorite of the two soup dumpling was the crab. Â We will definitely be coming back again. Â Let's see how this one compares to San Francisco dumplings.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Justin R.,/user_details?userid=AdX8-U9Gm1ogfzYYQUzafg,"New York, NY",1/2/2018,4.0,Food here is excellent where everything I have had is delicious... however the one particular very young hostess I spoke with was racist which is why I gave 4 stars. It's not a big deal as I don't get offended but they do prioritize seating to Asian customers. I am a regular customer and in one particular instance my brother and I were number 90ish. The hostess came outside and called numbers 85 -103 to see if people were here. As soon as she got to 103 an Asian couple responded here and then were seated immediately. I went inside to ask if they prioritize Asian couples and they responded with yes they do. Again not offended and could be I was mistaken but what is most important is that the food is fantastic however I unfortunately can't morally give it 5 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I did take out rather than wait in line for dine-in, so this review is on the food only. I LOVE XLB and was expecting a lot from these famous ones. They were tasty, plenty of flavorful dumpling juice, but every single one of my dumplings was punctured - surprising because the dough was thick, which also wasn't that appealing. So I had dumpling soup...which wasn't bad, but didn't give me the joy of biting into a gushing xlb. I also ordered the cold noodles with sesame sauce and barely ate any of it.

I used to crave these specific soup dumplings on a regular basis, make it a point to take friends from out of town here, and even dine at their midtown location. My hubbie and I went tonight and ate what was hands down the worst Chinese food I've ever had in NYC. Actually scratch that - the takeout restaurant in my upstate NY hometown is better these days. The crab and soup dumplings were painfully bland and had shells in them (totally changed from the amazing savory pockets of tastiness they used to be); the noodles came out in a solid ball and the waiter tried to tease it out like a hair knot at our table looking ashamed of himself (the sauce too was again, flavorless); and the new place has lost all of its vibe and feels like a shabby healthcare clinic. I don't even care about the long lines, the shitty service, and the fact that they now charge tip (probably bc they know you wouldn't want to leave any) - it's the travesty of having no sense of pride and respect for what this place once was (which was even a bit overrated but at least tasted good), clearly not caring at all about the quality of the food, and taking advantage of poor tourists just to make a buck.

As expected, their was a wait of roughly 30 min, which was true to form. Since visiting our first time, we have come back numerous times and brought friends from out of town.

Joe's Shanghai is a pretty small restaurant. If you don't have a large party, chances are you will have to sit with at least 1 other party at a round table. We tried the crab & pork xiao long bao (juicy dumplings) & the jelly fish appetizer. Both were delicious & reasonably priced.

Soup dumplings were delicious, but almost every single one broke because they were too thin, which meant a lot of soup was lost! So, while the flavor was there, I couldn't enjoy them fully. The mu shu pork was spot on. Delicious sauce and probably the best thing we ordered. The pan fried noodles were decent. The beef and vegetables were good, but a lot of the noodles had no sauce and were therefore brittle and hard to eat. Would return, though very long wait with a weird number calling system to be seated. ALSO, note their B rating.

Stephanie S.,/user_details?userid=fkScQ1x1Ijt8BoNmMpgSJQ,"Washington, DC",3/13/2016,1.0,"Wow, not exaggerating but seriously the worst soup dumpling I've ever had. My husband and I decided to give this place a try on a Saturday night, upon recommendations of a few of our friends. When we checked in, the hostess handed us a ticket with a number, letting us know that it would be a 30 minutes wait. But that turned into almost an hour and a half wait. We ordered both crab and pork, and pork soup dumplings. Honestly, I can deal with the wait usually if the food is really good. But it was inedible. The skin of the dumpling was thin, but it lacked elasticity, and once we picked it up with the tongs, it ripped immediately. The soup inside the dumpling had a starchy aftertaste, which was very unpleasant. If this is the best soup dumpling in New York, that's pretty pathetic. It's definitely a tourist trap, will never recommend this place to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I found this place on yelp and it was supposed to be the best dumplings in NYC. Service was good, I did not like that they were burning incents because I have a very sensitive noise and asthma, so I had to take points off for that. The dumplings were ok, I felt that their dough was too think and possibly frozen previously and did not seem as fresh. We also ordered the rice cake which was good. Overall it didn't hit the spot for me when I visited NYC.

First of all, I didn't know the right technique to eat their stuff and so my first bite into their famous soupy dumplings meant an instantly scalded and burnt tongue for me. Second, it gets very crowded very quickly, and unlike some other equally popular places in Chinatown - where the servers are still relatively nice to their customers - the guys at Joe's seemed to know that they were popular and for some reason thought that gave them the right to treat everyone like dirt. If you're going to treat us like dirt Joe's, I'll take my cold hard cash somewhere else, no matter how popular your dumplings are.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

West K.,/user_details?userid=ITvPLa0RztVl-oxbattSXg,"Oslo, Norway",11/26/2017,5.0,"Joe's shanghai is an amazing Chinese restaurant. By far my favorite dish they serve is their soup dumplings. The only draw back of this place is that they're so popular, so getting a table can be a little bit of a wait. I'm not the type to wait in line to eat anywhere, but this is somewhere I'll hang out for 10-15 my next during off peak dining hours to be seated. The dining staff is both prompt and attentive. Although it is a busy restaurant, the food comes out quickly, and if you want a drink or to order another dish, there is always someone available and willing to help you out. One of the waiters at the restaurant actually turned out to be an old friend of the friend I went to the restaurant with. Small world! Joe's shanghai is not only a delicious, budget friendly restaurant with AMAZING soup dumplings, it's a part of the community. I could not recommend this place highly enough.

The food was OK , the price was cheap, but still very hard for me to take such a bad service. I'm a Chinese, I love Chinese food and always gave rather good rate for Chinese restaurant, but this one really irritated me. I can't believe our Chinese fellows can be such mean.

Jacky R.,/user_details?userid=6i8IamhpWETkyeMUboCboQ,"Brooklyn, NY",7/20/2015,3.0,"Considering the wait and hype around this spot, it barely lived up to its expectation. I came in here on a Monday afternoon with a party of 2 and we were seated in about 10 minutes (not bad but other parties had to wait about 20-35 minutes). Ofc we had already planned out what to order. Pork soup dumplings, crab and pork soup dumplings, and Shanghai thick noodles. For a place that specializes in XLB's I expected to get the food in a matter of a few minutes. Over 10 minutes later our soup dumplings came and I'm not sure if it's just me but I'm not a big fan of the bok choi under the soup dumplings (I think they're used to prevent the dumplings from sticking to the traditional paper that other places use so the dumplings won't break upon contact). They get stuck on the dumplings and taste bland. The dumplings itself were alright (definitely had better in flushing and even the neighboring 21 Shanghai). The crab soup dumplings were stuffed very densely and was definitely better IMO than the pork soup dumplings. The Shanghai noodles were nothing special (very greasy too). The bill came out about 29 for 2 people so it's definitely not too pricey but was it worth the hype and wait?

Nan H.,/user_details?userid=fsbESJ0tug7p8Tw2Uh6fMQ,"Mountain View, CA",5/9/2013,4.0,I can't help making the comparison to Din Tai Fung aka DTF(not the Jersey kind)in SoCal and I have to say Joe's blows DTF out of the water. Their dumplings have so much more soup that it rivals the tang bao in Shanghai. The only dumplings better than Joe's are the Shen zen baos in Shanghai (Yang's dumplings if you ever visit Shanghai) but those are a whole other species altogether. Definitely splurge for the crab as it is much tastier than the pork. Service is bad and so is everything else on the menu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I always came here when i was younger so i do have great memories of this place. The food is amazing its so tasty. I came here with family and we all loved it. It may be slightly pricy but its worth it. Also this was the place that introduced me to glass noodles(no not actual glass that would hurt) but its super tasty. I have to also say that the seafood here is very good and this is coming from a person who dislikes seafood very much.

E C.,/user_details?userid=a9ZKjooe2yW_YiES39z7hA,"Brooklyn, NY",7/21/2018,4.0,Love the soup dumplings. When you order they give you a good portion enough for two people. Be prepared to wait if you go on the weekend. There really is no real designated seating for you to wait. Parking is also terrible but the place is accessible using public transportation. Service is usually on point. You have to ask for utensils if you are not comfortable using chop sticks. If you are going by yourself or with a few people you will be seated with other people. The only problem I have is that they include the tip to the check. I don't mind tipping for good service and I throw in a little extra for superior service but if the service sucks you shouldn't be obligated. Other than that I highly recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The soup buns were reasonably priced, 8 in an order. The only problem was that some of the buns stuck to the bamboo steamer and leaked when being picked up. Suggest the restaurant consider switching to steam safe pastry paper. Dried tofu and glass noodle soup have mushroom and dried shrimp, and it tasted really good. We also tried a few cold appetizers.

Unfortunately this restaurant only survives by reputation. The food had no taste and the Xiao Long Bao was not up to the usual standards. They were big and mushy and broke apart immediately to the touch spreading the soup all over. The seasonal vegetables were suppose to be cooked with garlic and oil. Instead they came with no garlic and no taste at all. Super bland. The beef noodle soup was horrible. Noodles were not cooked. They were doughy and raw. Â We would not recommend this restaurant unfortunately. It is iconic to NY but unfortunately they have let there standards slip from 10/10 to 2/10 Very sad.

Ordered the wonton dumpling and it was unlike anything I've ever had before. This dumpling actually have a very tasty meat and liquid - served within a bamboo steam basket on a blanket of shredded lettuce. Also tried the slightly spicy squid, which was tasty too. Very busy place, full of people. Bathrooms to the rear on the right, passing storage rooms and waiting among boxes of foodstuff. Each toilet is one person only so if door is locked, just wait. Unless you're with a big group and get a big ""party"" round table for yourselves, you'll be seated at a big table possibly, and then others will be seated with you also as they arrive.

I have been going with my family to the one on 54th St. it has been the best food every time that I go there and the service is good as well. We were stuck in the rain downtown and for the first time today we went to the Joe Shanghai downtown. The food was still the best. However, before you go to this one downtown you have to know that they will seat you wherever they want and there is a 50-50 chance that you're going to be sharing a table with other patrons. If your social person you won't mind. The other thing is that they absolutely only except cash. Do not go there unless you have more than enough cash otherwise you might be embarrassed not be able to pay the bill. The different dishes are about 4 to 5 dollars less than the one uptown, but the one uptown you can use your credit card. So you don't have to worry during the meal if you have enough money to pay for it. I will Continue frequent Joe Shanghai often but I will stick with the one uptown. Also remember that both uptown and downtown during the prime hours of lunch and dinner there is a half an hour to one hour wait time. So go off hours and you have the best of both worlds, little wait time and the best Chinese food you ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There isn't anything to write home about their Chinese food -- Joe's Shanghai is plastered with awards won in the early 2000s.

We ordered squid with pickled vegetables, house special flat noodles, rice cake w/ pork, string beans, xiaolongbao(3 pork, 2 pork/crab) and green onion pancake. Best item was the green onion pancake which came hot and very crispy. Exactly how they should be served. Worst was the flat noodles which were like udon noodles cooked in soy with some additional toss ins. The xiaolongbao were still good, just not great. The soup was a little watered down, skins on some felt a bit thick and despite this, many were stuck together causing immediate tearing of the skin when picking up. All in all, good meal, just not special enough to battle a trip into Chinatown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You won't be seated until your entire party arrives but DEFINITELY put your name in so once those slow pokes arrive you get priority seating.

Keith L.,/user_details?userid=N7lsv0dfspH4oMinD44Rxw,"Hoboken, NJ",3/14/2016,4.0,"I have to say the pork dumplings were very good and looking around that seemed to be what everyone was ordering. In addition I ordered sesame chicken which was pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. You sit at tables with other people that can get crowded. The system for waiting seemed like it could be improved. We got a number for two and were told 20-30 minutes.

Joe's Shanghai has been around forever, and have earned a reputation, but it's undeserved. The XLB here is pretty mediocre. Meat seems good quality and soup is a little bland but the skin is what really kills it. It's thick, they're ugly, and each basket arrive with at least 1 already broken and spilling out.

He hasn't been here in a few years and was craving Joe Shanghai's water dumplings. So we got here at 5 and got a number. We were a party of 9 and because we were a large group many of us were coming from different places and was not there yet. They refuse to seat us even though there were 2 people missing. When we finally all arrived, they told us there were no tables for us. We waited for another 45 mins and constantly asking asking the lady when will the table be ready. She would rudely ignore you and keep screaming numbers in our faces. They could never give us an approximate time on when they could seat us. My family and I ended up leaving and going to another restaurant. I will NEVER visit this place again and never will recommend this place. When they get their head out of their ass maybe I'll consider this place. Joe Shanghai, you're not that special.

We came for the XLB which were good but overcooked. They were all Â stuck together so when we tried to get them with the tongs they opened and half the Â soup came out in the dish before Â before getting to our plates. But the real problem here was that the service was beyond horrible and I know not to expect great service in Chinatown but this server was the rudest. He didn't even look at us while ordering, he knocked my tea over (which is complimentary but just tastes like hot water) when he brought the food and didn't apologize, and he snapped at me when I asked a question and then when I snapped back he acted like I was the rude one and told all the rest of the staff and they all circled my table like a bunch of vultures and he got someone else to give me my check.

Harry T.,/user_details?userid=YoFyrLtqCa_geMjXhEE_Bg,"Plano, TX",8/9/2009,4.0,"As advertised the soup dumplings are out of this world good. I don't have any experience eating them but it was delicious. The other food didn't fare as well in the popularity contest. We ordered the string beans which were fresh colorful and crispy and were stir fried for only a few minutes.The Shanghai noodles were tasty but not too sophisticated. I feel it would have been better with more veggies but perhaps that's not traditional. We also ordered a tofu dish that was average and also a deep fried flounder dish. The fish was fried so it was good but anything fried well will taste fine. Overall I would go just for the dumplings, but I don't know NYC so there may be better dumplings out there with a good menu too.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It might seem like a long wait but will be totally worth it. And they go through the numbers pretty quick. Make sure everyone is there when they call your number otherwise they won't seat you. Know what you want to order so that you can order as soon as they seat you. We were a group of 6 but two of us ran out to get boba and they called our number but couldn't get seated until the entire group was present. Anyway! We ordered as soon as we got seated: xiao long bao (steamed buns), Shanghai noodle, scallion pancake, chicken fried rice, and dumpling soups. The xiao long baos are amazing. Be careful when you grab it from the steam basket! There's soup inside so grab the buns from the top to avoid poking a hole and loose all the soup inside. The Shanghai noodle was okay. My friend loved the scallion pancake. She thought it had a good amount of scallion flavor in it. I thought it tasted okay. Very mild in flavor. The chicken fried rice was really good. The flavor was just right. I felt like I didn't need to add any more sauce to it. It was a little too greasy though, making the rice look kinda mushy. Dumpling soup was good. Their portions are good.

Shanen L.,/user_details?userid=lkUpGswBjo2xMWKlW-IxDg,"Jersey City, NJ",11/18/2016,3.0,"Love me some xiaolongbao. Especially on a chilly fall night. A party of 3 of us went for dinner on a Saturday evening so we already knew that we should be expecting a wait to be seated. We saw the massive crowd of people outside the shop on the otherwise empty-looking street and knew we had reached our destination. We got a number and were told the wait would be 30 minutes. I'm really not sure what the system is for seating here, a lot of people waiting seemed confused. A few times the girl would come outside and basically roll call everyone's numbers to see who was still waiting. For this reason, it's probably not a good idea to take a walk around the block while waiting for your number- they are not called in order or anything close to that. After about an hour and a half we finally got seated at a round table with 2 other parties. We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings with some beers right off the bat. Beers weren't super cheap, but dumpling price was on point. As others have noted, tip is included in your bill. Decided we would try another dish while we were there, so we also got the mapo tofu. The guy asked us if we also wanted to order rice with our mapo tofu, which was confusing since mapo tofu always comes with rice. It's not a dish you just eat straight by itself. OK, so we order some individual bowls of rice so we can eat the mapo tofu. Dumplings came first. They were very tasty and hit the spot. Slurp your heart out. No complaints with the side vinegar and ginger dipping sauce either. We finished these pretty quickly and then our mapo tofu and rice came out. The dish looked okay, but seriously lacked in any flavor (big flavor bang and numbing Szechuan peppercorn feeling is what defines mapo tofu). So this was a fail. We had to ask for the hot chili sauce and vinegar dipping sauce to mix with the tofu to even make it palatable enough to eat. We probably should have just stuck with what this restaurant specialized in- soup dumplings. We weren't a big fan of the host/waiter that kept hawking around the table, trying to pull dishes out from under you before you were even finished. It felt very uncomfortable, like he was just waiting to shove you out even though you were ordering multiple rounds of drinks and dishes and hadn't even been sitting down for a half hour yet. I understand there's a line outside, but come on, I just came from that line....after waiting for an hour and a half. Let me at least enjoy my meal in peace. Front of house staff was very friendly as we were leaving though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Once you are seated, they will bring you water and ask if you want to order the xiao long bao first. Don't be surprised if they seat you next to strangers and spill water on you. Also you may not really hear what your friends are saying because it's extremely loud there. The pork and crab xiao long bao are really yummy. It has more soup than other restaurants that serves xiao long bao, but the meat is smaller. The scallion pancake is really good and wasn't that oily. The duck was really flavorful and delicious. However the vegetable wasn't that good. Overall, if you are willing to wait an hour and want xiao long bao with more soup, then you should come here.

Djerica L.,/user_details?userid=_jALA4OIHO3fGKLOEziTag,"Brooklyn, NY",6/23/2017,4.0,I've been here twice. Both decent experiences but the second time the line was way too long. We waited probably 45 mins for seating and I'm not quite sure it's worth. The food was good and the service was fast. I had the pork dumplings which is what they are famous for. It was Delicious but be careful not to burn your tongue!! We shared some scallion pancakes which were really good. My boyfriend had the Singapore chow mei fun dish which was massive. Beware that the serving sizes are for at the least two people maybe even three. The chow fun was not my favorite but it's more because I'm not a fan of the dish in general. We also tried the fried mini buns for dessert. It was just okay. I thought the Dough had a weird after taste. It also came with a side of condensed milk to dip it in. It's a crowded space but it was kinda nice sitting next to other people cause we ended up striking lots of conversation. It also seemed very authentic because there were a lot of locals there even though there were tons of tourists. The prices are VERY good. I was shocked when we got the bill because we were stuffed and tried so much food. I would recommend if your in the area but not sure if I would wait for over 15/20 mins for seating.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

At first, I had no clue whether if it's good or not; however, my parents told me that this place is famous and delicious, and that they even have it at flushing (if it's in flushing, you know it has some sort of standard). I ordered my childhood dishes: scallion pancakes, cold sesame noodles, and soup dumplings. My friend ordered sesame chicken and vegetable fried rice. THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE!!! So worth it for the price! I am the PICKIEST person with my scallion pancakes; I usually judge a restaurant by their scallion pancakes. THEY WERE SO CRISPY AND HOT AND FRESH AND THIN!! If you've truly tried scallion pancakes in Taiwan, you would know that it should NEVER be doughy, and have very little scallions. Joe's Shanghai NAILED it! Even my friend, who only eats american-chinese food, fell in love with it and made me promise to bring him back here to have some more.

Kathleen V.,/user_details?userid=ALpun6xgSCmoeUCrjtxTQw,"New York, NY",11/12/2014,3.0,So this place is known for its pork soup dumplings. They are definitely yummy.

So if you're expecting to be just seated with your party of four prepare to have guests.

We were given menus, but never offered drinks beyond the standard tea. Food came fast but nobody really cared whether we liked it or not.

Although the food was okay, the customer service was absolutely horrible. We each ordered one order of dumplings each and after waiting about 30-45 for our food and seeing multiple people around us who came in after got their food before us we finally decided to ask them about our food. My boyfriend then asks our waiter about our order and our waiter is completely rude and just says wait, nothing else. We keep waiting and waiting then after five mins ask someone else and this person just flat us ignores us, then we finally ask this girl at the counter for a manager and eventually get our food and they still forget one of our orders. This place might be great to some but my first impression after hearing so many good things about their food and coming from California absolutely sucked. Maybe they think because they already have so many good reviews they don't need to keep up with their appearance, but they should also realize people from all over the country visit New York and ""hot spots"" in New York and they should treat every one of their customers with respect, especially if they can't even get an A (they had a B rating).

The wait was not bad for two but we were not informed we would end up sharing a large table with strangers. The first thing i noticed about this place was that 90% of the customers were well.. Not asian. Being asian myself, i have gone to hundreds of chinese restaurants. I found some of the items to be way overpriced. The 1/2 crispy duck was mostly small, boney, skin, fat and cost $18 dollars. Usually, this would cost much less in the surrounding restaurants or where im from. Although, my girlfriend did enjoy the crab and pork dumplings. i think it's truely overhyped and would never return. People should give surrounding restaurants a try as well.

JB L.,/user_details?userid=KDHqkwjuf5aifiiAzoqrgw,"New York, NY",9/5/2016,2.0,It was a bit challenging finding this place because it was in the depths of China town. Let me go straight to the point! Very busy SMALL Chinese restaurant that's serves dumplings and several Chinese cuisine! Food taste good and price was reasonable! My only problem was the tables were so close to each other it makes you feel claustrophobic! Although the food taste good I only gave it 2 starts because I'm very very CRITICAL when it comes to CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Staff was rude in a way and when you're seated they rush to take your orders right away. The server we had knew little of the English language and he was very rude and aggressive. When the food was served not even 10 minutes you are given the check right away. It seems like they care more about your money than providing an extraordinary customer service experience.

The chow mein was a bit oily but I liked the sauce and the thick noodles. And they put a lot of seafood in there - shrimp, scallops, and squid.

I got that same experience when biting into the scallion pancake which was nice and crispy on the outside plus flaky. We were a party of 6 and ordered 2 orders of pork soup dumplings, 2 orders of pork & crab soup dumplings, 2 different crispy noodles, seafood noodle soup, and a whole steamed fish.

Â They have only one table for two, so we first shared a round table with a single customer and two young women who spoke in Chinese. Â After they left, two other groups joined the table. Â We did not find the setup intrusive and were able to see close up other dishes which looked even better than what we ordered. Â For starters, the crab and pork soup dumplings were fantastic. Â I was expecting soup, but these eight large dumplings are served in a bamboo steamer over a bed of cooked cabbage. Â They need no condiment; however the soy sauce with ginger shavings on the table was a nice addition. Â I was eyeing another appetizer and was glad we ordered only the dumplings because they were more than enough for two. Â For mains I got the Szechuan fish fillet, which was perfectly spiced and cooked and melted in my mouth. Â It was served with bean sprouts (only) so may be best to share, as one person eating fish and sprouts may find it boring after a while. Â I would have preferred a colorful veggie or two added. Â My husband got the double cooked pork, which was notches above any carryout version we have ordered. Â The complimentary hot tea and white rice were also good. Â Service was fine and the wait was reasonable. Â My suggestion for improvement is to remove the clutter--employees personal belongings in plain sight--and deep clean the entire place.

Although, after a long day of walking through Chinatown, this would probably be the last place I would want to be. It also has communal tables because it is that crowded. You will need to sit next to strangers. This is not a bad thing though, but I personally prefer my own seating space and more privacy with my guest(s).

The Place is a little ""Overrated"" but definitely the best Chinese Food your money can buy. The Place is always packed, there is always a wait of 20-30 minutes, and always a line of people that spills out the door into the Street. Your Patience will be rewarded. Once your number is called, you are entering a Frenzy, the Restaurant is always super packed, you are guaranteed to sit in a table with complete strangers, Its cool I've never had a problem with it, just a bit awkward lol. There ""Soup Dumplings"" is a must, its the first thing the waiter asks you when you are seated, ""what kind of dumpling"""" Ordering these dumplings is a must. We always order the pork & crab dumplings, they come out hot and Steamy served on a steam tray, the dumplings are full of Flavor Liquid and just pop in your mouth with flavor, they are literally full of soup and are to die for, but careful because they are so hot that i always burn my mouth lol. They have an extensive menu, everything I've tried so far is pretty good, Beef with Scallions, Shrimp Fried Rice, Pan-Fried Flat Noodles and Seafood, Salt & Pepper Pork chop etc. The Staff is very attentive and service is pretty quick. This is not the Typical place where you sit for hours and spend time conversing and sipping your wine or eating desert, You almost feel the common courtesy to eat rather quickly to give courtesy to the 100 people waiting in line outside for their turn to enter and take your place next lol.

Maybe it was the fact that my expectations were too high (after all, my family is from Shanghai and I was just there that summer eating the most authentic of xiao long baos), but the soup dumplings at Joe's didn't impress me all that much. The soup inside was overly oily and they were just so large that it was a bit overwhelming. However, I do have to say that it's impressive that there was a spoonful of soup in each dumpling. We tried the pork and the crab ones...definitely go for the pork ones if you do decide to go. The crab ones were too ...

Obnoxious servers who declined to offer any hints or suggestions from their multi-page menu. We each ordered different dishes with intrnt to share, but soup, appetizers and main dishes arrived all at the same time making it impossible to try to share anything. Waiters brought stacks of bowls and plates which we passed around the table. Empty dishes remained uncollected which made the table more of a garbage can than a place from which to eat food. Requests for tea refills went unanswered as did rÃ¨quests for water. Food was serviceable but nothing memorable. The din and crowd noise was headache level. Of course no credit card service and our individual checks were written in pencil on scraps of note paper. None of the waiters was able to decipher the bill or tell us the cost for individual items. So our group of seven got ripped off to the tune of more than $350. Mediocre food, absolutely the worst service since the Soviet Union went out of business.

Â The Soup Dumplings are unique to this place, and worth it just to try those. Â They were very good, but you may hear so much about them beforehand, your expectations may get too high.

The worst experience was when I was with a group of friends, and the waiter kept leaning on my friend's chair when he was waiting around. When we finished our meal and he was bringing out the oranges, he spilled juice down my friend's back.

Sarah T.,/user_details?userid=1_X4BCmctqNOh_qIEQO5ZQ,"Dresden, Germany",12/10/2015,1.0,"I don't normally write reviews but I felt compelled to because I came to Joe's Shangahi with a friend based on a recommendation and also reading Yelp reviews. First let me preface by saying I'm from Singapore and have eaten at some really darn good Xiao long bao restaurants in Singapore and Taiwan. The friend I was with had also lived in Singapore and Taiwan before though she's not Chinese. We ordered the regular pork XLB and the crab meat and pork XLB, plus the scallion pancakes and crispy pork based on Yelp reviews. I have one word - NO. To anyone expecting anything resembling Din Tai Fung XLB, you couldn't be further from this. Even though the skin was thicker than it should be and a lot of it, every single XLB tore off the lettuce leaf, but at least that gave us a chance to see the fat scum in the broth that came out of it. What we could salvage of the broth tasted blah. The scallion pancake was thick, deep fried and soaked in oil. The crispy shredded beef was really mediocre. Needless to say we didn't finish anything even though we had arrived with a XLB craving. The next day I went to another Shanghai Asian Manor for round two, I was hesitant from the previous experience but it was waaaayyy better - definitely go there instead!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
