The fish had a nice crispy outer which is what I prefer in a fish taco (you can keep the grilled ones away from me). The green sauce made me sweat - i like spicy but that's what it does to me.

Leslie T.,/user_details?userid=1msVg_B-Ef6K814sQDOTPA,"New York, NY",1/23/2022,4.0,"Luchadores is a small no-frills stall on the outskirts of South Seaport - basically the kind of store you come across as you're heading home from a nice walk. The line was pretty long and moved quite slow, there were 2 parties in front of us and it took around 15 minutes. There were only 2 guys working back there in a small space, so I understood. Everyone in line was patient and seemed like a good time to talk on date night. The burrito was massive and the fish taco was good, but the ingredients didn't taste as fresh as Tacombi down the street or others in the area. You get what you pay for. They also ran out of lettuce when we got there so he put cabbage instead (which I actually prefer) but running out of lettuce at peak dinner time is a big no-no. I think that was part of the slow down too because one of them had to keep running back to the fridge to check for ingredients and refill stuff. I appreciate the large portion sizes, but did note that neither of the servers were wearing masks while making the food. At least they changed their gloves in between, but while ringing us up he touched the cash register with his gloved hand, then used the same hand to sprinkle cheese on our burrito, only to swipe our card with the same gloved hand O_O",https://www.yelp.com/biz/luchadores-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The tortillas seem like they came out of a bag and weren't even warmed. The tacos come with no unique or individualized ingredients specific to each type of taco. They just ask what toppings you want on your tacos. The choices were a basic pico, boring shredded lettuce, cold cheese, and super expensive guacamole. They have multiple types of sauces you can choose from, so that's ok. It's basically an expensive Taco Bell. To top it off, the people working there seems like they would rather be anywhere else in the world; as if we were a nuisance for being there ordering food.

Excited to try this cute spot after walking past it for months, I dropped in around 2pm last Friday with a friend to grab a quick bite only to be greeted by an unhelpful staff and a confusing ordering system. My friend went for the fish taco (ringing up at nearly $6 for a single taco) and I opted for the cajun shrimp burrito, tempted by the potential for interesting flavor combinations. Now, as a Bay Area native maybe I've just been spoiled by mission-style burritos, but I'd easily have taken Chipotle, at half the price, over what I was served at Luchadores.

The rice was on point. The beans even more so. The Carne asada was seasoned just right. The chicharron taco was pulled pork that was just devine. It comes with cracklings on top. The crackling alone is good enough to eat on a slipper. This just puts the chicharron taco over the edge for me. Love at first bite. I enjoyed this dish so much, I went right back a half hour later.

Eterna T.,/user_details?userid=S0T7laoGM6lq02Dg4aP8rA,"New York, NY",3/7/2021,5.0,"Wow I'm so happy to find a really good Taiwanese restaurant in Manhattan ^^ As a Taiwanese American I'm happy to say that the dishes here are very authentic! I was pleasantly surprised by the pork chop and hong you chao shou (wonton in red oil). My friend ordered the fried oyster and the chicken leg over rice and honestly, every single dish was delicious and appropriately seasoned. The pork chop, which is part of their restaurant name, was very good and evenly seasoned/lightly roasted, plus because I got it a la carte it only cost me $3! It has a good amount of fatty vs lean meat and is cut into nice edible strips for you. The chicken leg and braised sauce over rice was also good, with a very thin fried film on the chicken so it's not too greasy or fried but still has a bit of smoky flavor. The real surprise to me was the wonton in chili oil. The first time I had it ten years ago, my friend took me to a local famous one in Taipei somewhere near Da An and I have been trying to find a comparable place in the US since, and I think I finally found one! The red chili oil is very fragrant and has plenty of minced garlic and cilantro so it is very flavorful.

Timothy L.,/user_details?userid=CDA9Yrh4fIxHZPFuI0sbTQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/2/2020,4.0,"Came back on this Sunday to try their pork chop. Ordered the pork chop rice and the pork chop noodle soup. The pork chop was nicely fried; not too dry. It was tasty with a hint of five spice seasoning which made this unique from the pork chop that I usually get from Vietnamese and Korean restaurants. The rice was also seasoned with five spice seasoning as well. Both dishes came with chopped pickled mustard green. I also decided to try the salt and pepper chicken. Crispy piece of dark meat chicken fried with a breading and also seasoned with five spice powder which made it very flavorful. Didn't taste the pepper; should have name it Five Spice Chicken instead. Overall, a nice dining experience for only less than $17.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The oyster pancake was a bit too mushy for me.  The pork chop over rice was tasty, juicy, and quite a large portion.  The noodle soup was tasty and had a lot of noodles.  The fried shrimp was dry but crunchy.  I probably would skip the oyster pancake and the fried shrimp next time.  The prices were very cheap since we ordered 5 dishes and only paid $30.  Service was the usual in Chinatown, fast and brusque.  I'll probably be back to have shaved ice and the pork chop over rice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The rice itself is mixed with regular cabbage as well as sweet and sour cabbage and when mixed well with the rice gives an amazing mix of salty, sweet, and sour burst of flavor. The reason I give it a 4 star, is because it wasn't exactly the nicest looking place, service was ok, and unless you get their popular dishes, they may or may not be good. For now, I would definitely come back when I crave my pork chop over rice and maybe next time I'll try their highly advertised shaved ice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Service is fast - of note, only cash is accepted at this restaurant which would probably explain why all their food is between $5-$6.

The herbal jelly was homemade, tasted very different than the usual canned kind they serve- lighter flavor, and silkier.

Daniel S.,/user_details?userid=PoLCjBjppLUmG-rSpX3WNg,"Philadelphia, PA",8/18/2017,3.0,I had lots of different Taiwanese food and street food. This restaurant probably chooses to make food in an old fashion (traditional) way. That's why food tastes very different and homemade style. I would say it's not authentic but I'm not a huge fan of the vintage homestyle Taiwanese food. If you are into nostalgia dramatic flavor from your childhood in Taiwan you'll probably love this place a lot ( I'm assuming you're roughly 40 year old now :P). But in summary food is kinda oily but super cheap.

Vivian Y.,/user_details?userid=Mp-vjRBdI1JyvtzuE-Infw,"Brooklyn, NY",10/3/2015,4.0,"My usual at this place is the chicken leg over rice with a marinated egg (extra $.50). I always add the egg because it's only $.50 and it reminds me of childhood. During my most recent trip, I opted for the salt & pepper chicken over rice instead which seems like a new menu item since I hadn't seen it before (or maybe I didn't notice it?). I wasn't that impressed with it since it tasted like popcorn chicken and there wasn't much of a salt & pepper taste. I do like that they used dark meat which was juicy and wasn't really oily. I also like that it's less of a hassle to eat rather than the chicken leg. To me the best part of their rice dishes has to be the pickled mustard green and ground meat. It just works so well together with the whole dish. For around $6, this is definitely a cheap and good eat.

It was sticky and juicy, with generous bits of shredded pork and vegetables, including peas, which was a first for me. And finally, their shaved ice is SO GOOD!

Just point at the pictures. The food is satisfyingly good at a small price point. The pork chops are delicious.

Jason T.,/user_details?userid=X8x9iXcPH1oo0qYXdnnoeg,"New York, NY",8/3/2017,3.0,"Tucked in the famous winding street of Doyers is where you'll find this restaurant. I am unfortunately a big fan of pork, live close by and decided to visit here with my niece for dinner yesterday. We got there around 6pm and found the place pretty full. We asked to sit and were directed to a large round table where 2 separate other guests were sitting. Alright. There was enough room for us though. I ALWAYS do my research before attending a restaurant and as you may have guessed, they have pork chops. We ordered one as well as the wonton with spicy oil and the salt and pepper chicken over white rice. The pork chop was okay. It was a descent size. The wontons were boiled and were surrounded by an oil that was just right in spice -- as I am a punk when it comes to anything spicy. I don't remember however the wontons having any meat in them. It was more noodle than anything and if there was any meat contained, it was at a bare minimal. The dish was garnished with a teaspoon of garlic and cilantro. The salt and pepper chicken was the most pleasurable for me. Just enough chicken (the size of popcorn chicken) for us. There was flavor there. Also served on a mountain of white rice and a ladle-filled portion of greens, which I could have done without. There was a fragrant note to them that was offsetting. There was also some cabbage in the mix and I was okay with that. A can of Coke and a Snapple Lemon IT to seal the deal. The ladies serving were stoic and will give you hot tea if you ask. All this for $15. Wow!!! They have take out here as well. I might visit again because they do have an extensive menu. Not a priority though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kimberly K.,/user_details?userid=_qYjW9xj6ndi1puZ6GxQkQ,"Plainview, NY",12/7/2017,2.0,"Wanted a quick bite- mainly to avoid the cold and was looking for something a little cheaper (as I've been spending way out of my budget). After scoping around on Yelp, I decided to put in a pick up order here. There seemed to be a lot of rave reviews about the fried chicken bento box so that's what I decided to order. This spot is small, snuggled in the middle of a lot of other Chinatown shops but easy to find. The cashier wasn't too attentive (maybe because the store was empty)? The bubble tea that I ordered was probably the worst one I've had and most definitely not something I would ever order here again. It was extremely watered down and quite expensive given the plethora of bubble tea establishments in its near proximity. The bento box was quite small-town a lot smaller than I expected it to be. The fried chicken however was delicious- packed with a lot of savory seasoning with each bite. Usually, when you order a bento box, you're expecting a pretty light on the stomach but satisfying meal.

The wonton didn't have any flavors or  any meat in it. I literally felt like I bit in mesh of wonton skins. As for the chili oil, they were not even that spicy or flavorful as well. As for the pancake, there were maybe only six pieces of oyster cut in small pieces. The pancake batter that they used were too watery. They ruin this dish completely. It tasted disgusting. The only good thing was the beef over rice and the porkchop over rice. This saved the place from getting a 1 or below stars. Will give this place another chance next time.

The meat wontons here simply do not have any meat in it. If you are lucky, you may see minimally visible pieces of ground meat. The pork chops that it's known for were also lackluster. They did not marinate the meat at all and there is an unpleasant 'raw' taste to it. The seaweed cold dish was also undercooked, making it difficult to chew and swallow. The popcorn chicken was decent, but adding basil instead of cilantro would make it more authentic.

George K.,/user_details?userid=QP2zlxvclIUT9ODNrhWlUA,"Irvine, CA",11/22/2015,5.0,"You know that One Star Michelin dim sum place in Hong Kong? Well, my rating is done in the same respect: the food is so good, that no other considerations like decor, etc. matter.  When you walk inside, you see an extremely humble restaurant reminiscent of a small family owned restaurant in Taiwan. The large round tables are shared so be prepared to say hi to some strangers (everyone's really friendly so no big deal).  The place would probably get a ""B"" in cleanliness, but once the food arrives at the table none of that matters. I'm Taiwanese American and had not eaten Taiwanese food in 3 months. After ordering the shredded pork rice (a staple of Taiwanese cuisine) and taking a monstrous bite, I began to cry. The humble flavors reminded me of Taiwan and my childhood when my mom would cook this dish for me after a day at school. I had an ""Ego- Ratatoille"" moment (when he ate the Ratatouille, Ego thought of his childhood) and had I had a pen to write notes, I would have also dropped it.  The food is extremely delicious, simple, full of umami, and happiness. The staff is extremely friendly and also, did I mention the food is UBER CHEAP? Basically, a must when you're in NYC and if you live nearby, a regular place to visit indeed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ucilia W.,/user_details?userid=EUT64zAfjzFqo3nC0elhXg,"Oakland, CA",6/2/2018,2.0,"I was disappointed with the four dishes and one dessert I ordered here. As a Taiwanese, I had hoped that this place would serve food that is at least minimally good. It's not. I wonder if the restaurant once had a Taiwanese chef but no more. I ordered well-known street food -- maybe that was a mistake. The pan fried oyster cake, a signature street food in Taiwan, was so unauthentic that they really should use another name for it. Their version is basically spring onion cake with bits of oysters; the sauce is the sweet and sour kind that's typically served with roast duck. If you've been to Taiwan, then you know the sauce should taste completely different. I also had Taiwanese marinated duck, salt+pepper chicken, Taiwanese kimchee and shaved ice (taro, red beans and condense milk). The duck and chicken are ok. The shaved ice was sad: globs of taro and red beans drenched in condense milk on top of fast-melting ice. I've never been served a worse-looking Taiwanese shaved ice. Perhaps the rice and noodle dishes are worth your time; I wouldn't know. I just wish I had a better experience eating there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/taiwan-pork-chop-house-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Yes, the food was cheap and the quality matched the prices. I grew up in Taiwan so I know what's good Taiwanese food. This restaurant is a cheap imposter. Nothing authentically Taiwanese. We ordered seafood stir fried noodles, pork chop rice, oyster pancake, fried oysters, and Taiwanese cabbage. The seafood was from frozen seafood packages so it's chewy and not tasty. The pork chops and minced pork sauce on the rice were not seasoned well and tasted stale. Instead of using tapioca starch in traditional Taiwanese oyster pancakes, they added wheat flour and that totally changed the texture. The sauce for oyster pancake wasn't made properly. The fried oysters were American style with thick flour coating instead of Taiwanese style with light coating. Even the cabbage was Napa cabbage instead of Taiwanese cabbage!

Rather than coming with bacon and egg, it's all a la carte. The problem is when you order the bacon, they literally bring you a side of bacon instead of adding thin strips of bacon to the burger. On top of that, the bacon was all fat and the fries did not come with the truffle aioli. Since it's all a la carte, what used to be $28 cost me over $40. The menu stated the price of the bacon was $5, but when the bill came, we got charged $12!!! If the burger had been good or better than the original,  I wouldn't have minded the price increase given inflation. My mom's risotto came out cold. If we hadn't purchased another scotch bottle tonight, we probably wouldn't return. To top it all off, we found out that the great and lovely manager Dasha left the place.

A swanky spot with live jazz. I normally don't like jazz bars, but this one is exceptionally good.

On top of that, our waiter was blatantly racist.  A very, very disappointing experience for what was supposed to be a nice night out.  And the drinks weren't strong and quite watered down as well- two thumbs down, if you're a person of color I would avoid this place at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We topped it off with their famous 28 layer chocolate cake - man what a treat!! We even had some to take home. The live jazz was amazing.

For cocktails we went with an old fashioned made with an Elijah Craig Bourbon and the Oaxacan from the menu. The presentation on the Oaxacan was creative and helped keep it at the proper temperature. No spoiler - you'll have to go to see it! We split the cocktail shrimp - always a good test - and passed easily. The scallops were excellent although the corn spoon bread could have been warmer. Chicken with mashed and Brussell sprouts had a delicious crust. Coffee gelato was a nice finish and paired well with another old fashioned. Service was attentive, too! We'd have felt good about the value in NYC - but the live music totally put this place over the top. On Sunday night it was an excellent trio playing 1920s traditional jazz that evoked Coney Island.

However, the taste of almost every dish we had was extremely underwhelming. The trout was cooked beautifully. The skin was crispy, but it needed salt badly. Portions were small, too. Did not enjoy the food overall. It could just be because it was restaurant week, but you figure restaurant week is when restaurants would put forward their best to attract new customers.

Farah G.,/user_details?userid=7KmDkQr1-HN6Ua-olZKWwA,"Centereach, NY",8/25/2021,5.0,"As someone who doesn't always take the time out to leave reviews when I have a good experience, I had to leave a rave review for this restaurant because my experience last night was UNBELIEVABLE. My waitress' name  was Young and if I could leave a review for her alone, I would give her 10 stars! From start to finish, this restaurant exceeded my expectations. I went for a special birthday dinner and the ambiance was incredible. The live music was excellent (not too loud and we were sitting right in front of the stage), and the food/drinks were absolutely divine. We started with the combo meat/cheese/paté board and octopus, then had the NY strip and the Chilean sea bass as entrees (the Chilean sea bass with cauliflower purée was OUTSTANDING, I swear I dreamt about it in my sleep), and because it was my boyfriend's birthday, they sent over a very cute complimentary chocolate cupcake with a candle, and we ordered the Sphere for dessert which was gorgeous and worth every penny. Their whiskey selection is out of this world (so many to choose from, almost overwhelmingly so) so we chose to do a whiskey flight. Young was so informative and really took the time out to explain each and every whiskey to us. She even gave him a little whiskey on the house while we were waiting for dinner just as a birthday gesture. I ordered two cocktails beforehand which were both also great. We never felt unattended because they checked on us frequently, and I can't stress enough, this was probably the best dining experience I've ever had BAR NONE. If you're thinking about going to this restaurant and bringing someone special, RUN don't walk. I'll certainly be back in the future!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The guitar player was amazing to watch and listen to, especially the solo he had!!! Only thing that was a little disappointing was that the salmon lacked flavor.

Service was excellent. Food - must haves include truffle fries and brussel sprouts!  The chicken dish is nice and highly recommended. Don't plan to have a super private conversation here though.

Sunday brunch at Fine and Fare is an absolute must if you're not a brute. Prices were fair, food great, decor was simply gorgeous, I just love this classy place. 5-Stars + 1. Of all the brunches in the City I've been to, this place was the most....pleasant. Chris our server was amazing, so attentive to us, offering unique menu items, making recommendations.

Kinza J.,/user_details?userid=rl_t_WBpGRhdnmbWr0bGzw,"Buckley, Manchester, CT",10/23/2019,4.0,"If you want an upscale dine-in experience, there is no better place than fine and rare. Food portions are incredible along with the taste so definitely worth every penny you spend. I hosted my fiancé's birthday party here but the reservation alone required a pre-order of food and a deposit which can be very frustrating to deal with if guests don't show up so you lose money. However, the service is just so exceptional and the management/chef are there to give you the best time you can have. Even going back and forth via email with the manager/director was prompt and easy. They do need to accommodate guests of larger than 6/7 parties with the ability to pay individually for what they order, that would've saved me a lot of trouble and money. The 28-layer cake was custom made for my fiancé and was hands down the best cake I've ever had. I truly want to thank the chef for such an art piece. Every guest who tried the cake literally wanted to take a slice home with them. My only problem with the place is the ridiculously loud music that makes it impossible to have a normal conversation. If the jazz musicians are performing, please at least turn the regular music off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Well firstly a steak that is not drenched in sauce. The description of the Tamahauk steak states it comes with a chimichurri sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't doing the meat justice. The steak came drenched in some sort of sauce that overpowered the flavour of the meat. The said chimichurri sauce came on the side together with blue cheese sauce. When I ordered the same steak in other steak houses it was always seasoned and dry to showcase the meat. Also, a small order of asparagus that costs $14 seems odd since it wasn't anyhting special. Everything else was top notch. The scallops, the octopus, and crab cocktail. Will I be back? Yes, but not for the steak. I think most steak enthusiasts will agree that proper steak is served to showcase the meat, and if the meat is good then only salt and pepper are needed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Because with the ever changing gastroscape of NYC, the options at any given moment are nothing less than daunting. The food, mixology, staff, and atmosphere here are just that amazing. The live jazz every night is an awesome theme (as with their sister establishment Flat Iron Room) as well, although on a recent visit, the music was a little less inspiring than in the past. With so many venues in the city, the din is so overwhelming that conversation is difficult at best. Coupled with loud, obnoxious music, packed bodies, and, well we've all experienced that. At F&R, all things are civilized - not pretentious, constrained, nor stiff, just enjoyable.  An environment where fine food and spirits can be appreciated while appreciating the company of others. If you have not had one of their smoke-infused cocktails, I highly recommend starting your evening off with one. They take it to a new level by offering several wood varietals. Not into peatiness? No problem as their breath of spirits and knowledge are jaw-dropping. They have something for every palate. Their Mezcal collection was another recent surprise: I always knew about their extensive American, Scotch, and Japanese whiskey holdings - but, like 10 Mezcals? I'm stayin! The food - well, it pairs perfectly with everything else. On our last visit, we were a party of 8. We opted for a varied pre-selected menu. Everything was enjoyed: Salmon, chop, strip, *""ribbons""  (shaved carrots, zucchini, squash with a honey-mustard vinaigrette), burrata, all excellent. As for dessert - just order the sphere.

They helped me find a scotch I really enjoyed that I would not have otherwise ever planned to try. I would give the staff 5 stars. The atmosphere with the live music on a Saturday night in the middle of Covid was amazing... made you forget there is a pandemic going on. It was on the louder side so having a conversation with all 4 of us was difficult but it was nice to have live music. The reason I only give this place 3 stars is because the food was not very good. I went with 4 people and all of us were disappointed in our dishes. The steak I got had good seasoning but it was very tough. When I spend $40 plus on a steak I don't want to have to chew each bite 15 times or have to saw through it with the knife. My girlfriend has an allergy and we asked for the carrots to be served on a separate plate they put them on the same plate as the steak.

The servers are very attentive and always cleared used plates and cutlery quick. I definitely recommend the oysters and other items from the raw bar. They were very fresh. I had gotten the paella. It was filled with seafood and well seasoned, but the rice was a bit watery. I would recommend a different entree since there are better places for paella. I got the Fine and Rare Sphere. If you love desserts on the sweeter side, I would recommend it. The dessert was great and very good in the beginning, but it was a bit too sweet halfway through. I would have preferred the sphere to be made of dark chocolate and the liquid chocolate to the dark chocolate as well. This is my personal preference.

Patrice C.,/user_details?userid=CgOWFQYnmLkIDPqji0w0Xw,"Manhattan, NY",5/5/2018,3.0,I took a friend here for her birthday. I'd been before with a large group and quite liked the drinks. The live music is great and the songstress belted our some heartfelt tunes. My back was to the stage but my friend enjoyed it. We opted not to drink and just had dinner. I got the bolognese and she tried the fish (I think it was bass?). She liked it but didn't love it. I didn't try it as it was sitting on a bed of veggies which included bloody onions. My dish was fine. The pasta was a good consistency but the sauce left a lot to be desired. I actually put hot sauce in it to give it some flavour and that is blasphemy. Sigh. I really wanted to like it. We then had the creme brûlée which was the winner of the night. There were flecks of vanilla bean which leant it some complexity and bits of fruit on top. All in all I'd rate the dessert a 6/10 and the food 3.5/10 so average-ish. One nice touch is I mentioned to the waiter when I ordered the creme brûlée that it was my friends birthday and he brought out extra desert offerings with a candle. We really appreciated it (too bad the taste wasn't there). The two dishes and one dessert came out to 100 after tip. So meh. At least there's live music?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ali V.,/user_details?userid=FoeaygeTK_TLc_YT9oWcaQ,"New York, NY",2/15/2018,4.0,"This place was very full at 7:30pm on a Saturday. There would have been no room if we wanted a table for dinner without a reservation. We got seats at the bar, which gave us a nice view of the stage. There were two different jazz bands that came on that evening. Besides my friend and me, there was an older couple who seemed like regulars sitting at the bar, a young man having a drink alone, and a group of friends standing around and chatting. The tables seemed to be mostly filled with couples. The music was nice, and was quiet enough that people could still have conversations. They had a great selection of whiskeys, and the bartender had a lot of information about each of them. It looked like someone would climb up on a ladder when people ordered less-common drinks that weren't kept in the main bar area. I was served my 1792 Sweet Wheat Bourbon from the flask, and given a glass with water, a glass with ice, and an eyedropper to add water more carefully.

We weren't there long enough for the 2nd band's intermission; otherwise, we would've had to move at least 3-4 more times factoring in the intermission and the end of the 2nd set.  To add insult to injury, two of us were pushed back into the alcove such that we could not see the stage or performers at all.  Putting a table, chairs and diners right in front of the steps while the stage is in use is clearly a NYC Fire Code violation and ruined what was supposed to be a nice night with friends who hadn't seen each other in a few years.  For the amount of money we spent, we could've had a much more enjoyable, uninterrupted time at any of the other upscale restaurants in the city.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The cocktails here are quite good. They don't come cheap but cocktails are made very well. We had the Ginger Brenner House, Highlander, a flight of Scotch Explorer, and the Smokey Old Fashioned. As for food, I would skip it. The pork chop we ordered was on the tough side but acceptable. However the sides, truffle fries and French lentils were subpar. We told the staff about the non truffle tasting truffle fries and they took it back to the kitchen. When they brought it back, I thought there would be some hint of truffle taste. There was NONE. So we didn't eat any fries. Onto the French lentils. One word. BLAND. We asked for the manager and brought this up with her. She apologized and made things right.  I would prob stick with cocktails and music but nevertheless service was great and they did what they had to in order to smooth things over. I would def come back for the music and the cocktails. The two different groups playing were quite good. The first group was better but the second wasn't bad either. The cocktails were done right. Our Scotch flight was presented well. They brought six glasses and then a caddy with all the Scotch to be poured. The guy pouring was pretty knowledgeable and we had a good flight!

For our main course he had the paella which he said was ok, not great, and I had the Greek grain bowl which was 80% quinoa and had hardly any beans. They also ran out of tofu when I was there. So basically we paid $20 for a huge bowl of quinoa. The ambience is very weird. When the jazz band wasn't playing, they had songs that sounded like techno/electronic music blasting.

I loved the casual but intimate vibe of the restaurant and was amazed by the kindness of the staff. We ordered calamari, fries and karaage for the table, which were all pretty good! I ordered the pork Katsu curry and a shishito pepper skewer. The pork was a little dry and the curry needed a little more flavor but I still enjoyed my dish! And the skewer was well seasoned and pretty good. We brought a cake for my friend and the staff was kind to give us a candle and bring the cake out for us.

Unfortunately, I was let down. I'll lay out how it was and let you decide. The American Wagyu was dry and not seasoned, maybe a little black pepper was on it, and it was $5.50 for the 4 small pieces (pictured.) The Tako Yaki had one piece of octopus in it, the size of a pencil eraser. The Yuzu Cheesecake was $9 for two doll size slices that tasted store bought.

Just from looking on the outside you can tell that this place is not authentic Japanese food -- it looked more like a Chinese restaurant with Japanese food. Upon walking in, the smell of bleach and dishwashing soap hit my face and I already wanted to leave but it was too late because my friend had already been waiting for me inside for 20 minutes and we felt bad for leaving. We ended up ordering 3 skewers and it came out to around $18 I believe....so not worth it. The skewers weren't bad but its overpriced and nothing special or authentic about it. The service here also is not the greatest, I called to ask if they accept reservations and the person who picked up the phone immediately went ""NO RESERVATION"" a millisecond after I finished my sentence. And when I asked if only walk-ins are available they quickly replied as if they were in a rush. Funny though because when I walked into the restaurant it was basically empty.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ai-ki-ya-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Liuting Z.,/user_details?userid=izSbgCQy4fRBSPviy8MwRA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/24/2021,4.0,A new Japanese spot at Ktown. I have to say that sukiyaki is a little more expensive than I expected (59 for 2). It says that we have to place at least 2 orders (1 order for 1 person). BUT the beef inside the pot was so little.... I think I only got 3 bites.... It would be much better if they put enough ingredients into the pot. I added beef intestine which is pretty cool! I recommend this place because the flavor is good and I like how they use marshmallow to add sweetness to the sukiyaki pot.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ai-ki-ya-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Came inside by accident not paying attention to the name I was aiming for dim sum palace but figure I'd give it a try since I was already inside. The best part was the drink I got the Tokyo night I think it's called that was so good. For food I got the pork gyoza that was okay but the problem was the Oyakodon. The chicken was a bit slimy but the rice was just mushy. I felt bad returning it back to the kitchen close to closing but even the waiter asked me if I was going to take it to go because I barely ate it.

If there is no issue, getting food here is fine. Today was one of those days where I had an issue. I ordered my bento box online at 3:20 and was there at 3:30. I waited there 20 minutes as I watched three (!) walk ins order and leave with their food. I wasn't particularly mad but wondering if my order fell thru the cracks so I nicely asked the counter person there (a tall, curly haired dude named Jonathan) if my order was coming up. He responds to check my phone of the pick up time, which turned out to be in a few minutes, to which he responds, ""Well that's when it will be ready.""  How rude and unsympathetic! Finally when the order does arrive, three minutes before closing, I decide to have one rice ball before heading out. Seeing me opening the bento box inside the bag, Jonathan then goes on a rant about how rude I am by eating there when they are closing, then he goes to the back kitchen and passive-aggressively loudly tells whoever's there that I'm eating there because they took forever.

Perfect lunch stop. The bento box is such a good deal for the quality and how much food your get. You can pick a meat or do a tofu veg option, then you also get two sides and two rice balls of your choice. The sides range from seaweed salad, to curried cauliflower. I really enjoyed the green beans in a sesame sauce. Had a nice nutty flavor on top of the crisp beans. The rice balls were also really good! I liked how they were slightly warm and not like chilled like the rice balls you typically might find. Everything was cooked very well- tender, crisp veggies, soft yet firm rice, & tender salmon and chicken. I left here feeling satisfied and happy.

Hoji latte was lacking flavour and not very creamy - personally have made my own at home and had it at blue bottle which is much more rich and flavourful. The original rice ball was decent but once again did not command flavour to return for a second round.

Lana V.,/user_details?userid=h7GloVptK0mEgZo2VrPkxw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/6/2018,5.0,Well this turned out to be my favorite discovery of 2018 so far. The only places I've been able to find rice balls in so far have been in Dumbo under the archway (these guys!) and occasionally at places like Smorgasburg. Finally there's a brick and mortar rice ball restaurant! They have bento boxes with other stuff too. And it's a block from my kid's school so I'll definitely be coming by on the reg. Not only are their rice balls delicious (my fave was the tuna and mayo) but the soups are fantastic too. The simplicity and small size of the restaurant makes it even more appealing.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rice-and-miso-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Stephanie P.,/user_details?userid=R8skIfMGcMRugWPUR0OBog,"Washington, DC",12/20/2022,5.0,"Glin was very good! Cute spot in Fort Greene that had a good amount of different options. To start we had the curry puffs, seafood salad, and their tom yum soup. All were great. The curry puff had great filling and was nice and flaky. The seafood salad I just loved! It had a nice subtle heat, which I really enjoyed. The tom yum had great flavor, a lot of mushrooms, and was served very hot. For our entrees we got the pad see ew with shrimp, and the massaman curry with chicken. The massaman was very good, although I do wish it was spicier. It was pretty mild in heat, which was a little bit of a disappointment. The pad see ew was alright, and leaned a little drier. I'd probably pass on ordering it when I come back.

Best thing I've eaten in a long time. The scallops weren't overdone. They were flavorful. The sauce that was under the beans and mushrooms was amazing. The veggies were fresh. My husband had a burger. He said the beef was great quality. The fries were hot and fresh. This was a great late night option that we stumbled into on a whim.

No wonder since most of the other restaurants around the area were quite empty compared to the popping atmosphere at The Warren. They have a mish mash of dishes - from deviled eggs to charcuterie, to tacos and pastas. But all very well done. The carnitas tacos were the definite highlights for me. It's a decent sized restaurant and well spaced out for safe distancing and the service was attentive. I had a sip of the old fashioned made the owner of the restaurant. Very very good.

Ravioli were delicious and had an amazing sauce. Other reviewers mentioned small portions but I thought all of these were fairly generous - more than enough food for 2.

Ariella G.,/user_details?userid=TwEwJi1_M9dQHkDK_gcNsQ,"Brooklyn, NY",6/20/2018,4.0,"I always recommend The Warren for drinks and bites in the West Village. It is perfect for meeting friends after work, a date, or a solo drink - the environment has an elevated casual feel, and while you'll see people dressed in after work clothes it manages to be fairly laid-back but also nice. I typically come during their great happy hour (which goes until 8pm) and stick to the small bites, though the larger entrees also look delicious. Get the brussels sprouts and some charcuterie to pair with one of the many wines they have available. There is also a daily punch that is worth looking in to. This is not a huge space so would not bring a large group here, but its perfect for groups of 1-4. The service is always friendly and timely, even though there are usually numerous people to attend to and only a couple of servers. I've enjoyed coming here year round: the space provides a nice reprieve from the harshness of winter while in the warmer months the windows open up allowing for you to bask in the city's full summer glory.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-warren-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

From the moment you walk in you are greeted with such warmth and wonderful hospitality. The decor is homey and a great place to have an intimate date, drinks with your friends, and even rent it for private parties. The staff tends to your every need and are very attentive. The bartender (Sal I think) is so friendly and makes the best cocktails. The owner even came by our table several times to make sure we were content. The food was nothing but AMAZING! We had a lot of tapas and were able to try out many items from the menu. Everything on the menu has a bit of delicious twist that makes you want more of it. I personally am not an oyster eater because I have been let down so many times with the freshness and taste but I think I finished about the whole dozen. Their famous hamburger melts in your mouth as do the pork chops and the lamb chops. Everything was exceptionally fresh and you can tell that it was the highest quality of food that you were eating. This is definitely going to be my new spot and/or late night go to place. I highly recommend it and I have been in the restaurant business for 13 years.

Really liked the atmosphere and the two female bartenders were very nice. The prices were more than fair. The one star review is due to what appeared to be the manager on duty. Fairly young, dark hair, bearded guy in a suit, looked the part. He single handily ruined our experience. No joke. It was slow, so he stood at the bar and talked to the two female bartenders the entire hour that we were there. The problem? He was so LOUD. A loud booming voice. And he's literally standing 5 feet from us, and 3 feet from the employees he was talking to. How did he have no sense of his own voice? I couldn't tell you. So loud it was hard for us to have a conversation. We literally looked at each other and were like, are you kidding me? On top of that he was dropping F bombs and swearing in his loud voice as well. As a manager myself, I was pretty taken aback by his unbelievable lack of common sense or professionalism. We literally cut our time there short solely because of this man. We will never be back. I hope ownership see's this review because my god, with this man running your place.... best of luck.

Things happen, and you just acknowledge it and make it right.  But no response. So, if the Warren isn't concerned with what they put on the plate, neither am I. What a shame. I always give places a second chance when it's warranted. But when a group of friends suggested we try the place out recently, I was more than happy to suggest we eat elsewhere.

We were here for my birthday celebration and I felt so bad for having my friends come here in 90+ degree weather with no A/C. It would have been OK if there was any outdoor seating. But no, we were placed in a sauna- like room with little ventilation. All of us were sweating like crazy, extremely uncomfortable but wanted to give this place a try.  The food was sub par. The chicken paillard was a quite a let down.  The twice fried chicken was too greasy for our taste. Mac and cheese was watery ( it is more like mac and cheese soup)  but to be fair, it is flavorful. I would have given this place one star if it was not for the decent waitstaff. But honestly, I could not wait to get out of the restaurant and move on to a different place for drinks.

Stephanie T.,/user_details?userid=sV1wAPAhaQQpr_GXcNTFKw,"Town of Hempstead, Long Island, NY",8/5/2022,4.0,The food and drinks here were really good.  I really wanted to give this review 5 stars but had to knock one star because of the service.  When we first got there we were able to choose any table to sit at.  Then our server came over to tell us that happy hour was going to end in about 40 minutes so if we wanted to order we should.  So we ordered a frosita and a sangrita.  We waited about 10-15 minutes and still no drinks and it seemed like our server was preoccupied with something else that they had forgotten about us.  Another table had come in and sat down and somehow ordered drinks and got their drinks which led us to then get the attention of the host to ask where our drinks were.  They finally brought our drinks over but I don't think the drinks were correct.  She handed me my drink and said margarita and I was like no is this the sangrita and she was like yes. I took a sip of it and it was definitely a margarita. I couldn't be bothered with asking for another one after already waiting 15 minutes for our drink order that they just pour from a slushy like machine.  Maybe it was an off day as they seemed to have something going on - just wished that they were a bit more attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/medusa-the-greek-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We got the pikilia (all 5 dips), the saganaki, and the octopus. Everything was delicious! The black truffle tarama was our favorite dip - unique and absolutely delicious. Their pita is also very good and fresh tasting. The saganaki was very tasty, though I do like when it's served very hot and soft, and that's not the case here. The octopus is good and it's a healthy serving size! Brandon and Nini were so friendly and pleasant.

Lilli S.,/user_details?userid=-UA3I1NQIdLZSy7ZHrJNKw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/10/2022,5.0,"Delicious Greek food in a beautiful, hip, and capriciously decorated setting with great outdoor seating, close to Barclays, and open late late! We tried the dip sampler which comes with enough pita for two but enough dip for five! If you order just for two, be prepared to save the dips to slather all over your entree (which probably comes with more pita) or just get extra pita and have a dip feast! I was floored by the black truffle fish roe spread - I wish I had a huge jar of it at home to put on everything. Tzatziki was nice and thick, spicy feta was rich salty deliciousness, eggplant was fresh and smoky, and the beet hummus was light and sweet. For entrees we got the lamb platter and the salmon platter - I ordered my salmon rare and it came out perfectly. Sashimi quality in the middle! And it was a huge filet with a nice layer of skin. For sides, I preferred the spinach rice over the Brussels sprouts - it paired better with the meat and you get a delicious dill and feta salad on the side anyway so no need for more veg! Also shoutout to the pita which comes hot, soft, and doughy in the middle - could have made an entire meal off of it.

Flamur C.,/user_details?userid=rKXltExJs9eHH2TwAMxDLQ,"Brooklyn, NY",2/23/2023,3.0,"I'm giving this place 3 stars because it didn't put me over the top to justify at least 4 stars. For me to give 4 stars it would have to impress me. This review is a bit complicated because it didn't come across as a totally Greek restaurant. It had a little Spanish flair to it. If you look at the menu it has Carne Asada gyro and platter, Lamb Empanadas and Sangria. All Hispanic dishes or descriptions. The food was decent not impressive. If you're going to be a certain ethnic food restaurant then be that all the way. It's like you have an identity crisis with what you're serving. I don't know if it's because they're trying to please too many people but if I go to a certain ethnic type of restaurant then I want to experience that ethnicity's food and no side tracking. Come to find out that the owner is the same owner of two other Hispanic restaurants in the same area. So I see where they get the influence from. If you're a Greek restaurant then keep it Greek. If you're a Colombian or Mexican restaurant then keep it totally Colombian or Mexican because that's what I am there for. To experience their native cuisine. The service was good and attentive, but again, the food didn't put me over the top like the Greek restaurants in Astoria.

A lot larger portion than I had expected so plenty for everyone. Fresh crudite and pita to dip with, we ordered extra cause it was so good. Personal favorites was the spicy feta and was pleasantly surprised by the black truffle Tamara. I normally don't like truffle but this was subtle enough to not overpower the tastebuds. My only complaint is I wish they had just a regular hummus as not everyone is a fan of beets and the flavor can be a bit much. For a main I went with the brunch gyro and loved it. So much flavor, and was able to use some of the remaining spreads to create some delicious unique bites along the way. Sooooo much food though.

Jessica E.,/user_details?userid=KZXxN9-lXSp14sVL_4fqbw,"Manhattan, NY",2/3/2022,2.0,I placed an order through a food delivery app for pick up. Food was ready upon arrival. Ordered the moussaka and the squid ink truffle infused dip with a side of pita and crudite which came with a small side of greek salad in two separate containers. The moussaka was underwhelming. The layer of bechamel was thin and lacked a depth of flavor and heartiness I expected. The squid ink infused truffle dip was tasty and I would have appreciated a bit more texture. It was well infused with truffle and the pita was a good pairing to that. The reason for the rather low rating is due to finding mold on the tomato that came with the salad. It was a big turn off and I could not help but double check and wonder about the food quality for the rest of meal. Really hoping it was an off day. I will not return.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/medusa-the-greek-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

When the waitress told me it would take longer for it to cook I didn't expect to be waiting there for 40 minutes. I then ate the chocolate mousse which was okay.

We ordered items we had not yet tasted, (octopus, spanakopita, moussaka, okra, zucchini chips, baklava) in addition to their wonderful spreads and salads. We have enough for 3 meals! The portions are substantial. The octopus was divine.  Spanakopita was so light and fluffy.  Marvelous. Loved the zucchini chips. Warmed them in the oven. The other food remained hot. The packaging is top-notch. Everything in its own little tight-fitting container. Nothing leaked. So fortunate to live within 15 minutes of this superb restaurant.

What arrived was a takeout dish of lots of lukewarm potatoes, a small amount of  ground lamb and a few oversized slices of eggplant topped with an entirely loose unset béchamel slopping over the sides.  No spice, sauce or even salt, .   It was easily the worst moussaka I've ever had.  It seemed like they didn't actually have any moussaka when I ordered it and they just threw some ingredients in a tub and hoped for the best.  The Horta tasted a bit rancid as if it had been cooked in oil that was not fresh. I couldn't eat more than a bite of it. The meals redeeming feature was the Greek yogurt topped with cherries which was delicious as always.

The dumplings have always been spot on and consistent, which is a primary key to a successful restaurant.   It has been over 3 years since our last visit due to the COVID pandemic, and we have final broke out of the shell to make it back to Joe's to devour the soup dumplings, and I must say, I am so heartbroken to find that the soup dumplings are NOT what it used to be.  The dumpling skins have become thicker, the soup taste profile is a bit off, bit into more crab shells than usual, the side dish sliced ginger is not thin, and the most noticeable is the size of the dumplings is larger.  Furthermore, the bamboo baskets are not lined with Napa cabbage, which makes the dumplings stick to the parchment paper.  Why am I complaining about the larger sized dumplings?  I did notice that there are considerable amounts of NEW restaurants that are serving the same style dumplings in the nearby blocks, and I can only assume that Joe's is feeling the competition.   With competition,  one will always try to do bigger and better.....  I have been in the restaurant business for over 40 years, and I can see that this is an initial sign of nervousness when they are met with fierce competition.  I've always preached that quantity will never prevail over quality in the restaurant business.  Quality will always create and increase repeat customers.  I am so so sad to see the negative changes at Joe's.  Unfortunately, last night at Joe's might have been the last.  It was great while it lasted.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Lisa A.,/user_details?userid=EDZKP6CGokUIoQfRmkLhdw,"Katonah, NY",2/3/2023,4.0,"Went on a Saturday night and had to wait for an hour and so we went next-door to the sushi place and had drinks. You give your name at the door and they give you what looks like a raffle ticket and they called us within the hour. The room is very brightly lit so don't expect any kind of ambience. I felt somewhat rushed, and we gave them our orders for appetizers and dinner all at once. The first dish that came out was their famous dumplings and they are just as delicious as everybody makes them out to be. They are hot and inside is a very rich broth that is a little thicker than a typical broth because of the pork fat in the dumpling. We then ordered the scallion pancakes, and they were very big and light and crispy but they did not have a lot of flavor, but the sauce that came with them made up for that. We then ordered our entrées which included crispy shredded beef, general taos shrimp, and I believe it was general tsaos chicken, as well as a spicy fish dish. The chicken was fresh and crispy and delicious and very flavorful and it came with broccoli. The crispy shredded beef was also very good but honestly, I think I can make it better at home and we also ordered the spicy fish which had an unusual flavor, which I think was an overpowering star anise which made it almost feel like it was in a curry sauce, but it wasn't. That dish went to waste because it was too spicy and the flavor was just too overwhelming. You don't get rice which I found weird and when we asked, they brought small bowls. I also ordered food to go which initially they gave me somebody else's bag but in my food order was sautéed string beans, and they were out of this world. They had ground pork in them, and they were slightly charred and had a lot of umami. Overall, I thought the place was very good and would definitely go back, but not at dinner time since it's too long of a wait but I would go back there for lunch during the week possibly early on a Saturday or Sunday.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Well when walking in to get to the table it was pretty busy during lunch hour which just shows that they must be doing something right with all these hungry mouths! The service was very quick, came in ordered the dumpling right away and WOW!!! The flavor was so robust the soup was nice and hot but not mouth scorching, the table had Chili Oil to compliment the Dumplings, which was a nice touch if you are into that kind of thing! Can say I want to go back and try other dumplings and other food they have on their menu, just from seeing other plates that people had around me, I was wanting to try this and that!

The food is very affordable and the service is fast once you're seated. This place is cash only and does not take reservations. If you're a party of 3+, I would recommend coming her at least an hour before you're planning to eat. The wait is sometimes long but very worth it.

Jay H.,/user_details?userid=vomeBb0d4JuSCxxnef1lYg,"New York, NY",3/14/2022,1.0,"This place is a tourist trap. The Shanghai food from another block over with the same dishes cost half the price and tastes a lot better. Can't believe we spent over $100 only for four items. We order the pork soup dumplings of course. This was the only decent item on the menu. Then we ordered a cold dish (tofu appetizer), this was really small and can't believe it was $15, totally not worth it for the lack of tofu. Then we ordered a noodle soup with five spiced beef, the beef was r really fresh and tasty but the noodles and the soup was so bland and lack flavor. The amount of noodle was so little it wasn't even enough for a small child to be full. Finally we order the sesame chicken, this was so dry , heavy in sauce but very dry chicken on inside. This was $20 and probably Panda Express would've taste better than this. The only dish that was decent was the soup dumplings and the Rick cakes. But even rice cakes was very greasy like fast food. For the sesame chicken- They probably cooked it overnight and reheated the chicken in the morning. It was pretty disappointing experience because we waited over 30 mins because we saw so many people waiting outside thinking this would be good but boy was I wrong.

Service is prompt and attentive meaning you get your food fast. While the menu is vast the best item  is the soup Dumplings. The Dumplings are very delicate due to being filled with a rich broth to drink before consuming the rest with complementary black vinegar and chili oil.

Jennifer H.,/user_details?userid=8pgQqEJV51ss4mlwd0xoqw,"Irvine, CA",10/10/2021,4.0,"Seeing all the reviews on Yelp plus seeing the huge line outside this restaurant makes you wonder if this place is hyped up. We came around 12:45pm, and was told the wait would be 30 minutes. However, it ended up being about 45 minutes. The inside of the restaurant was pretty nice. Menu had a variety, but nothing seemed extraordinarily special. My boyfriend and I got the pork XLB, crab XLB, the shredded turnip cakes, and the braised duck to share. The pork XLB was surprisingly good. Very large portions and filled with delicious soup. The crab XLB wasn't as good (just wasn't as tasty as the pork), and one piece had something crunchy and hard inside (maybe a shell?). The turnip cake was pretty good. I was expecting the dim sum style turnip cake, but it wasn't what I expected. It also wasn't piping hot when it came out. The appetizers were so filling that we probably didn't need any more food, but it was still nice to have tried the braised duck. The duck was so tender, and the sauce was yummy. Definitely would say the pork XLB and the braised duck would be 5/5 star quality. Note that this place is still cash only. Overall, not sure if the wait is worth it (this place should do the Yelp waitlist to improve customer satisfaction), but I did truly enjoy the pork XLB and the braised duck.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The service is not the best but I would still go back because the food is so good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

But I fear din tai fung is the industry standard and everyone else is fighting for second. I can't speak to any of the dishes here other than the xiao long bao which Joe's is known for and the only dish I ordered. Xiao long bao are soup dumplings, one of only a handful of items I can order in Chinese and one of my favorite foods in life that I openly seek when traveling. The line is long; as in 45 minutes to an hour in off hours like 330pm. The soup dumplings are good, but they skin is too thick and the meat filling is under seasoned and the broth while maintaining a tastiness that coats your lips, lacks depth and richness in flavor.

It was crispy and served in a rich (just spicy enough) brown sauce, loaded with mushrooms and veggies. The veggie LoMein was chock full of a variety of vegetables, not just noodles. The service is impeccable, and the restaurant clean and nicely decorated. We were greeted with hot cups of jasmine tea. The waiters were on standby so that no cup was left I filled, no request not immediately satisfied. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I recently dined at their new location and, I don't know if it was the fact that their new interior decor is just so much better and put me in a more generous mood or if they changed chefs, but the food was fantastic! I had the pork XLB (if you order just one thing, this should be it), which were flavorful, plenty juicy and not overly oily. In my ranking of New York City soup dumplings, the XLBs here might not be #1 but definitely rank within the top 3.

The tables are well spaced out and the host checks your temperature at the entrance. The best item from here is the pork soup dumplings- it took me a couple times before being able to master eating them- you have to poke a little hole and basically drain the soup out of the dumpling so it doesn't splatter everywhere and you don't make a mess before eating the dumpling. The pork fan fried dumplings are also good, but the dumpling itself wasn't as crispy as I would have liked.

I knew something was off when I arrived at the location and the staff told me and my friend 20 minute wait. We walked away for four minutes than all of a sudden our table was ready when nobody left. Very fishy, almost like they said that to dissuade us to not dine here. The soup dumplings were at a inflated price because Joe makes a killing on tourists or people that never had Shanghai food. None of the dishes that were soup dumplings would stand a chance to be sold by themselves. Insider Food did an interview with Joe and he said that his soup dumplings have 30 pleats good and on average chefs have 26 pleats. Well it's clear Joe doesn't work in the Chinatown one because there was 22 pleats when I went. The best surprise of the whole experience is when they charged me for 2 whole orders of crab meat soup dumplings when I ordered one pork, and one order of half pork / crab meat. Pork was $12.95 and Crab is about 3 dollars more but do what you gotta do to keep the lights on I guess.

While service isn't the friendliest, they definitely have a system in place to get you seated, fed and out the door quickly to accommodate as many customers as they can in their small dining area. We didn't have one set server the whole time but somehow the orders came out perfectly each time. I liked how they asked me as soon as we were seated if we wanted to order any soup dumplings since they are well known for that and it takes a little while to prepare. We ordered both types of soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, Shanghai style noodles and crispy noodles. Everything was amazing! I wasn't a huge fan of the crispy noodles but others in our group liked it. They deep fried noodles to make it crispy and then ladle a thick sauce all over it with lots of veggies and shrimp.

However, the other dishes were somewhat lackluster. I was craving Americanized young chow friend rice as well and having been raised by Chinese restaurant owners, I was massively disappointed in their other dishes. The young chow fried rice had zero taste, so I imagine the chefs forgot to add flavor given customer traffic.

There's always a line since they don't take reservations. We got there as soon as they opened and was able to get a table without any problem but noticed the restaurant was completely filled up 30 minutes later and the line outside was already long. The wrapping of the soup dumplings were a little thick I thought so not as delicate as XLB should be. For those of you who had XLBs at Ding Tai Fung on the West Coast or abroad, these XLBs are rather disappointing. The wait staff should be trained to be more personable. They walk and interact like robots so service was lacking.

I love the pork dumplings and all of its soupy glory. I would say they are Joe's Shanghai's best dish and the only thing I will ever get from here. It's nice and hot which makes it perfect for a cold day but it still tastes delicious when the weather is warmer, it's worth overheating for in the hot restaurant. I tried the cold noodles and it was way too peanut buttery; it literally tasted like noodles mixed with just peanut butter you get from jars.

The soup dumplings were amazing--thin, sticky dough filled with a delicious broth and a melt-in-your-mouth pork filling. I've never tasted anything like it!

The place is kind of small and congested. You will have to share table with others. There is a line to get a seat. I never had to stand in the line. The trick I use is to reach the restaurant at 11 exactly when they opens. Probably soup dumplings is the only things you should have here. I stuff myself with just the dumplings. There is a crab and pork version and a pork only version. Both are almost equally good. I felt the crab and pork version has a slight edge (very slight).

The soup in the dumpling was very rich and flavorful. We also ordered the spicy salt and pepper prawns and it was delicious, the prawns were juicy and not dry at all and the shell was coated with so much flavor. This dish can get too salty depending on where you order it from but not here! It was just the right amount of salt. Another dish we really enjoyed was the chef's recommended spicy schezuan style fish filet...this dish was sooo amazing. I've tried this same dish at other Cantonese/Chinese restaurants but Joe's Shanghai tops all. The shrimp friend rice was super good as well and paired nicely with the main dishes and was flavorful while not being overpowering.

We ordered all 3 kinds of xiao long baos (chicken, pork, and crab), green onion pancake, green beans, eggplant, and chicken fried rice. Between the chicken and pork xiao long baos, I could not tell which was which. My favorite type would be the crab meat xiao long bao. The filling had a bit more flavor, was juicier, and was slightly saltier. Unfortunately, the xiao long baos all broke easily. Almost everyone broke theirs when they were picking the dumplings out of the basket. The other dishes were good as well. We saw that a lot of people on Yelp recommended the chicken fried rice, so we ordered it. It tasted like what a typical well-made chicken fried rice should taste like.

So many people wanted to come in. And so many were in line just to get on the waiting list despite the chilling and dreary rain drizzling out. It was unlikely my family and I were going to get tables that day so we just ordered to go. Got the soup dumplings of course. On the record, I preferred the pork over the seafood one. Nevertheless, they were both very delightful. I could see what the hype was about. I wish they had more dumpling options (e.g., prawn). Would have been cool if there was a second floor.

I'm a huge critic when it comes to food and I can honestly tell you that Joe's Shanghai is amazing! The wait was a bit long and kept getting longer, but that's okay given how great the meal was. The standout dishes for me were the pork soup dumplings and the sesame chicken. Both the crab and pork soup dumplings were good, very different, but still good. The better one was for sure the pork dumplings, however. The broth was rich and flavorful as was the meat. They were a favorite amongst the whole family. Now, I'm afraid to have soup dumplings from anywhere else because I doubt any other restaurant can top my experience at Joe's Shanghai. I'm hoping to be able to get my hands on some frozen ones if they ship to other states. The soup dumplings were life-changing and I would recommend them 100 times over!!

Jennifer L.,/user_details?userid=_RjKq8EKmD3CYUn7pFzrsQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4/28/2019,4.0,4 stars for the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes. By far the best I've had in the city with a nice chili oil. Love the  depth of the broth in the dumplings. Thick skin so they do not easily break. The pork is soft and melts in your mouth. Always quick and fast service. This place is usually packed at lunch time. A definite must try. Remember it is cash only and service/gratuity is already included on the bill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

LINDA D.,/user_details?userid=2Pp5N7PIpkoc41AXtRbP2g,"Long Beach, NY",2/11/2019,3.0,3 stars for food only! This used to be a place I recommended to everyone. It's known for its soup dumplings and fresh food. It has changed so much over the years and I'm so dissapointed. Unfortunately it's definitely not know for its service or cleanliness. It was Chinese New year so I decided to go. I was always willing to take the bad service for good food. Now you will wait for 15-20 minutes to get a small cup of white rice that comes with your meal. If you need any question answered you can forget about it. The most disturbing thing of all is how terribly dirty the place is. Unbearably filthy. The walls right next to the table were filthy and the bathroom smelled like a sewer.

Alejandro E.,/user_details?userid=4QbgUAqmAnajanc0Fypuxg,"Morgantown, WV",3/9/2019,4.0,"Famous. This is the one word that's used to describe this place. There are a countless amount of celebrities that have been here and there's a reason for it. Come with a group for sure. This is the type of place that you order a number of plates and share within your group. You HAVE to get the dumplings. There is no way you cannot come here and not order the dumplings. It's what they are famous for. There's 150+ items on the menu to order so I'll drop se suggestions. On top of the dumplings, the sesame chicken is also good, the crispy duck was amazing, highly recommend it. Pork fried rice is a fantastic side dish to have.

We were quoted 1h40min and that's almost exactly how long it was. It was certainly worth it. They were still working on getting their liquor license as of 12/25, but it's a pretty basic selection of beers. That's not the reason you're here. The real reason is absolutely the soup dumplings. I had never eaten them before so I popped the first one into my mouth and scalded the entire thing. After I figured it out I was able to enjoy them and found myself wishing I had 24-36 more to eat. This was followed up by the general Tso's chicken which was without a doubt the best I have had. Perfectly crispy on the outside, delicate and flavorful on the inside, and a nice lingering spice of medium intensity. It is cash only and the prices are more than fair.

I grew up on Chinese food so my expectations are probably much higher than most. The wait was just a little over an hours which I did not mind waiting for good food. You must go inside to grab a ticket from one of the staff to be put on the list and receive a wait time! We had to share a table with other guests, which was a little uncomfortable but I completely understand due to their high volume. The staff weren't very attentive. I had to ask for water several times b efore he got it for me. I recommend getting what they are known for which is the soup dumplings. They were juicy and delicious but you much eat them right away! The stir fry noodle were good as well, had a chard flavor from the wok. But the beef noodle soup was terrible! There was literally no flavor. It just tasted like hot water tbh. Idk if that's a mistake or that's how they normally make it but I would never order that again. The sweet and sour fried fish was good. But the strong ketchup taste ruined it. I expected more from this place.

Jennifer J.,/user_details?userid=AuMf0RrdCJpZILNVeQAPUQ,"Skokie, IL",7/11/2018,4.0,We came for their highly recommended and famous soup dumplings! They were delicious we ordered the pork meat ones. This was our first time having soup dumplings. The order comes with 8 which was more than enough to fill my boyfriend and I up. We also ordered their scallion pancake which was really crispy. I was expecting them to have more scallions as the flavor to me seemed a little washed out. We also ordered a Shanghai fried rice for the both of us but after the scallion pancake and soup dumplings we shared it was just way too much food and ended up taking the rice to go. Joe's Shanghai is a very sought after place with limited table seating. We ended up sharing a 7 person table with 2 other parties which was a little awkward. I wish we had been able to get our own table. And the seating arrangement also made it even more cramped to fit everyone's food on the table with enough room to move around. I would come back but only for the soup duI'd definitely recommend for anyone trying soup dumplings for the first time to give this place a try just know you'll more than likely end up sharing a table with multiple different parties.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Guess what? The food was worth it! Atmosphere was a bit funky. 1970's large round tables and we basically ate family style. 4 in our party and a total of 8 at each table. No credit cards taken here so have cash. Maybe debit. Not sure. Pork and shrimp dim sum were well made and full of contents. The braised duck was moist, super flavorful and the leaks were a nice side as the duck sauce was a bit on the heavy side. All in all, it was fun and tasted good.

We have always loved soup dumplings and we visit joe Shanghai every single time we visit New York. we always felt joe Shanghai is much better than Din Tai Fung with their amount of soup actually in the dumpling. It has been in few years so we were excited to go back to joe. Good thing we checked on google because we did not realize they had moved from their old Chinatown location. We arrived at 1:45pm on Saturday and had to wait for 30 minutes which we did not mind considering how good these are. We finally made it in and had to share a table which is always the case. The dumplings were good as usual but the service was very very slow. We ordered 3 baskets and it took over 30 mins. Plus, by the time we finished our last basket the last dish still had not arrive yet. We were very disappointed.

We were told it would be a 20 minute way but they were able to accommodate us practically right away. The big line had not started building up yet but by the time we left, there was a crowd waiting to get in. I haven't been to this location in years but friends were in town from Seattle and we decided to go for soup dumplings. They were very delicious and bigger than a lot of other soup dumplings I've had lately. They did seem to stick to the cabbage a bit and I lost some luscious broth!  Oh, let me say that the service was very fast. Not surprising since they have to get you in and out. With that said, we never felt rushed. We ordered the dumplings, Peking Style Spicy Noodles, sautéed string beans and s&p spicy Shrimp (shell on). All were delicious. My only comment was that the spicy noodles were too salty and too saucy. They could add more noodles, less sauce and this dish would have been so much better. And they would make more money per dish by just coating the noodles with this sauce rather than drowning the noodles in the sauce. It was equivalent to hoisin sauce with some heat. That was the only dish I wish was a little better. Oranges at the end which was nice and refreshing. The hand towelettes were a nice bonus too.

And the soup dumplings are a must try and enjoy.  I dont think I would return to THIS location.  The other I hear is easier to get into.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The highlight of the meal was the pork soup dumplings. It was so much fun to eat and try not to spill the soup. The soup broth was incredibly tasty and not too salty, and the meat inside was amazing to eat. The crispy beef was also amazing and was some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The other people in our party ordered the General Tsos chicken and we were kind of confused because it was a weird orange chicken/general tsos hybrid. We are still unsure if we got the right dish, especially since they tried serving us the wrong dish before. The waiter also forgot our sides of rice and we had to wait 5-10 minutes to get it.

So authentic that literally brought me back to the time I was visiting Shanghai!!! The stir fried thick noodles was perfectly cooked, flavorful, and just the way it should be. The crab flavored Xiao long Bao came as it finished in the bamboo steamed basket. So fresh and simply awesome. The size is bigger than I expected. The flavor and quality were also better than I expected. The crab flavored filling and soup in the Xiao long Bao were the one of the best that I've ever had!

Kl W.,/user_details?userid=BiMQklzY2e_Xd90IN-FzHA,"Pasadena, CA",9/7/2018,3.0,I'm a little disappointed by this high rated Chinese restaurant. The steamed bao and dumplings were just so so. The spicy fish filet wasn't cooked as the authentic way and tasted not that good. They sell Chinese beer more expensive than other Chinese restaurants in NYC. And the overall experience wasn't nice too - they don't take card and the ATM machine in front of their door charges you for taking cash with any bank. The restaurant looks old and not very clean and people (including their staff) were talking very loud and noisy.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Irene L.,/user_details?userid=rCJd3UN1dXY4X_0KZG_YCA,"Brooklyn, NY",1/18/2018,5.0,"Joe's Shanghai is hands down the best place in NYC for soup dumplings. The soup dumplings here are the best. The dumpling skin is thin and the soup is very flavorful and the bits of pork inside it makes this dumpling so perfect. When it's very hot I usually poke a small hole in the dumpling and pour out the soup on the spoon and mix a splash of vinegar. I also really like the fried dumplings, and the Shanghai Fried Rice. In the fried rice, they have broccoli, eggs, and some scallions. It sounds plain but it taste amazing. The wait is long and as soon as you sit down the waiters will ask you how many orders of dumplings you want and they come arrive very fast-usually about 5 minutes. Also you do have to be seated with other parties and space is tight.

Try to get there when the restaurant opens to avoid the wait. Its small but most places in NY are and the turn around time is quick. Sometimes you might be sitting with another party at your table. My favorite is the crab dumplings but the pork is good too. Both are packed with flavor.

Donny Z.,/user_details?userid=ddakqQpCHImpMAKVKhAUIA,"Novi, MI",8/17/2018,4.0,I came where because of what I heard from others and the plentiful Zugat awards the restaurant has received. My family and I ordered 2 different types of soup dumplings - the pork dumpling and the crab dumping. The dumplings were delicious and so was the soup inside.

We also ordered some chicken and noodles but I don't think this place is known for anything else besides the soup dumplings so I wouldn't come here again for any other Chinese dishes other than soup dumplings.

Andy H.,/user_details?userid=-MMKSWwfFRu0acODQlNrXg,"Nashville, TN",12/2/2017,5.0,This is the best place to eat and before I went I thought it was bad but after best place in Chinatown.  The food is very good but it's pretty big.  The sesame chicken is the best chicken you can get and second best is the Kung Pow Chicken. I would always recommend this to anyone that likes Chinese. Looks small but very good food especially the chicken.  Very good service and fast to get your food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Pretty crowded space and they seat smaller parties together at large circular tables. The waiter took our order first and the soup dumplings came out pretty quickly while the rest of the table stared at us out of jealousy. The size of the soup dumplings is larger than your average soup dumpling and there is plenty of soup. Compared to ding tai feng, the skin is thicker and the presentation is less delicate overall, but still delicious. My friend and his family are from Shanghai and they think that Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings are better than the ones back home, so that's saying something. Also, eight for the price of $6.25 is a steal. This location is cheaper than the midtown location which is eight for $8.25.

Joe's XLB are widely known for a reason. They're tasty! Richly flavored pork with meaty broth. I'm obsessed with their basic pork XLB, much more than the crab ones. Each order comes with about 8. I could order so many orders and it wouldn't break the bank. This is on my list of cheap eats! We didn't get a chance to try their other dishes, but our fellow guests at the communal table ordered much more than we did and it all looked and smelled fantastic. The communal tables aren't as awkward and uncomfortable as you think. These tables are huge! Everyone minds their own business and you can barely hear others' conversations. The service is so fast, which is great. Their logistics and organisation surprises me. There were no unhappy customers. If you're new to soup dumplings, this is a great place to start. It can get extremely packed, but we came on a Saturday afternoon with no wait.

We were lucky enough to have our party of 3 seated fairly quickly. However, this place does get really busy so be prepared to wait and have your whole party with you. If you ever visit this restaurant you HAVE TO try their xaio long bao (soup dumpling). In my opinion, and the opinion of many on here, the dumplings are one of the dishes they do extremely well. If you enjoy those soup dumplings from Din Tai Fung, these are an upgrade from those. Their house special fried rice was also very delicious and paired well with the XLB. Their fried chicken was okay. I also tried their braised carp belly. It was tasty but be prepared to fish out those tiny/big bones. The minced corn soup was not the greatest. In the end, I gave this place 4/5 stars mainly because of the great dumplings, fried rice and good service but subpar other dishes.

Worth seeking out, it's located on a little side street in China town.  The tables are communal, so you may share a table with strangers but that's part of the fun, never know who you might meet there.

Sara M.,/user_details?userid=YMrua01AxoWPttElX5bu7Q,"New York, NY",12/6/2020,5.0,"Ordered delivery on UberEats and was unsure how it would be after the lengthy delivery. It was great! The food arrived and was still very hot & everything tasted as if it was in the restaurant. The hot&sour soup was delicious and very hot (it didn't even need to be heated up in the microwave). We ordered two orders of the soup thinking we would each have one... I don't recommend doing that unless you want a ton of leftovers. One order of the hot & sour soup can easily provide 2.5 servings. The spring rolls were also good and were still crispy (somehow they didn't get soggy with the delivery). We also ordered shrimp fried rice that was a pretty large portion and very good. The shrimp fried rice was not dry at all and hit the spot. The sesame chicken was still crispy and perfect... Joe's thought of a great method to deliver the sesame chicken (they cut out a hole in the plastic lid so the condensation didn't cause the chicken to get soggy) and it worked so well. The entire meal tasted just as good as in the restaurant. Overall, this meal was AMAZING! We are already talking about our next order. Would love to help provide business to this great place especially during covid.

For a Shanghainese who had countless authentic soup dumplings in SH, the ones served in Joe's Shanghai is very very mediocre. Their pork and crab filling does taste more fresh than your other options in Chinatown. However, the size of the soup dumpling was what had me shook. One equals two of those in Shanghai! They are way too big. The pleating was not done nicely either. The worst part was the skin. Their skin were way too thick and unenjoyable to chew on. I tried their other auth Chinese food as well. Either was too oily or had loads of MSG added. The restaurant makes you sit with complete strangers. Ppl from my neighboring seats ordered Americanized Chinese food like ""genera Tao chicken"" and ""mangolia beef"".

That, my friends, is a recipe for a legit Chinatown experience. By luck, our party of 3 was seated right away in a full house on a Tuesday at 7:30pm. We got 3 orders of XLB, an order of scallion pancakes, and the shrimp fried rice cakes. Soup dumplings have just the right consistency--skin breaks with the slightest puncture so handle them with some TLC before chomping down. I recommend ordering each round individually to maximize the freshness of the dumplings. The scallion pancakes were a bit drier than expected, but nothing too unpleasant. With the best for last, the shrimp fried rice cakes are a must-try. Generous portion size with a plethora of rice cakes, right amount of shrimp & mushrooms, and minimal veggies. All for ~$50 with tip. As anticipated, service moved quick. Expect to sit elbow-to-elbow with other parties in the same table, which I think adds to the experience.

We've all been to Ding Tai Fung but we all agree that the soup dumplings here are way better! Other than xiaolongbao, other dishes are great too - my favorite is the bok choy with mushrooms. Service here is whatever but the food definitely makes up for it. Highly recommend and would definitely return!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The Soup Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) was amazingly delicious!  We had the crab meat xiao long bao that were filled with mixed crab and pork meat in very fresh tasty soup inside 'em small steamed buns!  On a cold weather day, those steamed buns were totally a life saver that made me day!  Prices were reasonable; about 9 bucks for an order of 8 steamed buns. Good bang for the buck, wasn't it?  We also had the Shanghai fried noodles, which to me, was just like yaki udon in heavy soy sauce; not bad though!  The Lion's Head, or stewed pork meat balls, were my favorite; meaty, soft and flavorful!  The chilled pork kidney appetizer was really good; the pork kidney was thinly sliced and had a good texture (not too hard/ chewy or too soft/ mushy).  Sour Soup was just standard, and the shredded eel with yellow chives was A-ok.  The off-menu fried soft-shell crabs came in huge portion size, for about 22 bucks, was my mother-in-law's excitement for the money spent; she loved 'em exoskeleton-free fried goodness.  This place was totally worth the 30-minute wait time, and I surely would come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You share a table if you have a smaller group, but makes the wait faster. They had two types: Xiao Long Bao with crab meat pork, and Xiao Long Bao with only pork. I preferred the original, just because I was used to the texture and taste, but the crab meat pork xiao long bao was different, not in a good or bad way. We also ordered the beef noodle soup (quite bland, although the menu indicated it was ""slightly spicy) but the beef itself was extremely tender and flavorful.

Matthew O.,/user_details?userid=S_BWkaQ3NZADBHGokSRGeQ,"New Port Richey, FL",4/9/2018,4.0,"Super cramped dining room? Check. Hour long wait? Check. While these might not be the hallmarks of comfort dining, to me, they are the hallmarks of everything I want to see and experience in a restaurant deep in the heart of Chinatown. Joe's Shanghai is one of those restaurants that may be hidden in an ally but is not hidden from the people that know the deliciousness that it serves. The lines are always out the door and it is a beehive of activity. What is so good about this place you say? Soup dumplings I tell ya! Joe's Shanghai definitely does soup dumplings, AKA Xiao Long Bao, justice that many other places do not. Often times you get these semi-shrunken soupless dumplings at a lot of places. But here, be prepared to scald the inside of your mouth because these dumplings are packed with soup. Each dumpling comes out hot and fresh in baskets of 8, all nice and plump. The skins are so pleasantly thin that when you pick up the dumplings, you are so afraid that you'll pierce the skin and lose the soup before it gets into your mouth. But, for such a thin skin, it actually holds up remarkably well. It keeps everything encapsulated so that when you bite it, the soup gushes out in a glorious hot burst. The meat and filling on the inside is deliciously tender and most and complements the skin and soup so well. Sure, you may burn your mouth, but for the delicious flavors that you well experience, the pain is worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's always a fun and delicious experience when you come to joe's. First, you have to go inside and tell the person with the clipboard how many people are in your party, and grab a ticket that has your number on it.

I've been here several times and the service and food is always spectacular. Waiters are very attentive and take the order as soon as you are seated. This last time we went we came on a Friday for a late lunch and luckily were seated right away. I have came here in the winter before on a weekend night and waited an hour and a half outside because of how popular this place is, so plan accordingly. The tables are shared so unless you have a big group you'll probably be seated at the same table as another group but it's never bothered me. The place is definitely loud inside because of how busy it is, so not a great date night place. We always order the pork soup dumplings and crispy beef which are outstanding every time. The dishes are a bit on the pricier side ($17.95 for crispy beef) but worth every penny. The place is also cash only and tip is automatically added. The service is amazing-water always full and empty dishes always gone.

We would probably order the pork next time.  The restaurant has home small tables and some larger and they will seat you family style if there is no exact seat match for your party.

Aash S.,/user_details?userid=s6L04yD0DQ2_69Od8j3eSw,"Brooklyn, NY",12/5/2017,5.0,"If you want classic, authentic soup dumplings, this is the spot you go to. The seat is communal style, so if you come with a smaller group, or two or three people, you will probably share a table with others. Which is totally fine and actually adds to the experience in my opinion. My personal favorite thing to eat here are the pork soup dumplings, however everything else is great. There's usually a wait cause it's a popular spot, but if you go there earlier than you'd ideally like to eat, you can deal with that. It's in the heart of chinatown down a little crowded alley, and you really get the full experience being there. The walls are lined with pictures of famous people who've gone and eaten there as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Although the food is excellent here, I really do enjoy the fish tank which holds some beautiful specimens. Every time I walk into this gem of a restaurant I feel welcomed by the warm presence of these fish. One time I even tried to reach into the miniature aquarium, but an employee sensibly stopped me. Although I didn't get a chance to stroke my fingers across the koi as I would a dog, I could tell that they were fond of attention.

Other than the rude receptionist that seated us, the service inside was okay. Something to note is that they already add on tip to your bill so double check and make sure you don't double tip (unless you want to, then you're welcome to do that! :) ).

This place is small...coming from Texas I didn't expect to share a table with complete strangers lol they will seat you at a round table with strangers because space is limited. So if you don't mind hearing personal conversations and drooling over your neighbor's entrees then this works for u! If you're seated at a quiet table with strangers enjoy that awkward silence and avoiding eye contact lol,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ordered ones with pork and others with crabs. The thing is that they are regular dumplings, but with soup inside! And soup is freaking hot lol! Burned my tongue! They should warn people like ""caution hot"" or something lol! Dangerous!Dumplings were OK! But whatever at the same time haha. The place itself is weird, cash only. Really!? Had to go to the ATM. Also we had to share a table with some weird people. Chinese beer tastes like ass, no offense lol. The most amazing thing about this place that they have tons of pictures of owner with celebrities eating his dumplings. Service sucked big time.

I was in a party of 2 so we ended up getting seated at one of the large round shared tables. The restaurant is small and very crowded and you may need to sit with others so just keep that in mind. The food blew me away! I think it's the best XLB I've ever had. The dumpling skin is so thin that the soup looks like it's going to break through the skin when you pick it up (I hate it when the skin is really thick and doughey). We tried both the pork and crab/pork dumplings. Both were very very good. The only caveat to this place is the long wait - otherwise I'd be here every time I visited NYC.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jessica L.,/user_details?userid=o1Nob_XfbP06ijTDn-olVw,"Union, NJ",2/1/2018,3.0,"Oh my gosh when I came here I was really looking forward to having some of ""the best soup dumplings in Chinatown"" as deemed by multiple sources. I am currently reviewing and rating for 3 stars until I go again next time so I may update this in the future. My order consisted of the crabmeat & pork soup dumplings, regular pork soup dumplings, eggplant in garlic sauce, and a side of rice. My dumplings came out very hot and tasty but over cooked and they became dry when they got to my table. The eggplant and garlic sauce dish was also very hot and tasty, but lacked that Shanghainese spice and kick I am accustomed to. I suppose it's become a very Americanized establishment to better suit a wider range of patrons. It's great that the waiters all speak English, are very quick, easy to flag down, and check up on you often. The place is cash only, a little inconvenient but it keeps the prices low. The bathroom is also decent compared to some other bathrooms in Chinatown, but would appreciate it if they were better kept. Also there is no hook on the door for a coat and bag (I was heading out with my belongings and I had all my things with me so it's important to have a hook to use lol). I really enjoyed the service, temperature of the food, and the flavors of the food however I think it could do with some adjusting.

For a place with thousands of reviews, I'm expecting some top notch food but Joe's just doesn't deliver. Arriving at 530pm, I was in a 30-40 minute wait. Once you're inside you'll get seated at a table with other people unless your party is big enough to fill one of those big round tables. Don't really mind it though, just something you should anticipate. It's as clean as you'd expect from a ""real"" Chinese restaurant. I had the Xiao long nap, scallion pancake, and general tso chicken. It's decent. I'm from socal and this place is just about as good as any 3-star place you'll find here but with a long wait and less spacious.

Zachary A.,/user_details?userid=JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Austin, TX",6/10/2019,5.0,"With all the hype, Joe's really could've fell hard. But I was really impressed by the authenticity, the quick and friendly service, and the overall operation. Menu large and hits every American's taste buds as well as more traditional Chinese offerings. Waiters work fast but offer opinions on favorites and best ofs. I ordered quick and had sake, crab soup dumpling, cold sesame noodle, and soup pancake. Everything was good and I left still burping and tasting the meal (in a good way). Pancake essentially a latke  with some chives and had a great dipping sauce. But dipping it in the sesame noodle sauce worked well as well. Speaking of sesame noodle, the quantity is something else. They really pile high and soak it in the sauce. Pro tip is to add tons of chili sauce. Perfect noodles and a nice change of pace from the entirely hot meal from food to tea. The soup dumplings are as good as advertised.  Quite big and not too fishy so good for even the anti-fish eaters. Sauce overly vinegary for me but others seemed to like it. But in all the dumplings had such thick skin but a bounce to them that is just so rare and a perfect sight. Cash only but again super cheap for the quality and quantity.

Fair warning they seat you at communal round tables but I think that's what sets the mood and really adds to the scene. Recommend ordering the Crispy Shredded Beef off the specials menu. The crispiness is just the right amount and lathered up with a thick sauce with a faint taste or orange. Of course- you can't come here without ordering multiple Pork Soup Dumplings.

Been a fan for about 5 years however I was very disappointed on my last trip when I saw their C grading. For a place that stays constantly busy and makes money they should really have their health inspection as one of their priorities. Having worked in a restaurant I know that there can be a range of things that can get you from an A to a B, such as leaving an ice scoop in the ice maker or leaving boxes of products on the floor instead of on a shelf. However it looks like their offenses were much greater than that such as roaches and vermin prone environments.

After eating 2 orders of these, we concluded that they were excessively soupy (watch out for plenty hot liquid squirting out at first bite) and doughy. The string beans were average.

My fave place would be Nan Xiang in Flushing for it but since I was in Ctown, I decided to come here. One thing I hate about this place is that it's filled with tourists usually, where tour buses would bring them here which I find pretty annoying. Next, they love to make you share tables which is what happened to me last night. Had to share with 3 other groups on a big table. For 2 people, we ordered 2 orders of soup dumplings. shanghai noodles and a pork chop noodle soup. I used to love this place back in the days but I feel like some things have gone down hill for sure. Soup dumplings have definitely gotten saltier and pork chop were so so. Shanghai Asian Cuisine on Mott Street might be better than them now. I won't be coming back here.

I mean I'm sure it's famous but you have to enter through  like an alley to get here so it makes you feel like you know a great place. When you come in, it's family style seating, which mean you sit a big table with Probably 2 other couples who just got there or just finishing up. Which is kinda awkward of you all order the same thing and forget which one is yours. The Xiao long bao here is is sooo good! One of the best I've had! The lions head is also very very very good! It's sooo juicy and rich, I had to ask for a bowl of rice to counter the flavors. We ended up taking most of it to go and ate it back at the hotel.

Their soup dumplings are delicious and addictive. They are perfect to eat on a cold winter day or night. The only downside about this restaurant is that chances are you will have to be seated with strangers in their large round tables (so they won't waste any seat space as hundreds of people wait long periods of time to get a table everyday).

If you are closing the kitchen more than 30 mins before closing time, SAY you are closing 30 minutes before! Not only that but they put us to dine with 2 complete strangers having more than enough tables available, really? One of the worst customer service experiences, all would've been forgiven if food was good! But no...unless you favor egg shells in your shrimp fried rice because that's what we got...a lot.

I did take out rather than wait in line for dine-in, so this review is on the food only. I LOVE XLB and was expecting a lot from these famous ones. They were tasty, plenty of flavorful dumpling juice, but every single one of my dumplings was punctured - surprising because the dough was thick, which also wasn't that appealing. So I had dumpling soup...which wasn't bad, but didn't give me the joy of biting into a gushing xlb. I also ordered the cold noodles with sesame sauce and barely ate any of it.

My hubbie and I went tonight and ate what was hands down the worst Chinese food I've ever had in NYC. Actually scratch that - the takeout restaurant in my upstate NY hometown is better these days. The crab and soup dumplings were painfully bland and had shells in them (totally changed from the amazing savory pockets of tastiness they used to be); the noodles came out in a solid ball and the waiter tried to tease it out like a hair knot at our table looking ashamed of himself (the sauce too was again, flavorless); and the new place has lost all of its vibe and feels like a shabby healthcare clinic. I don't even care about the long lines, the shitty service, and the fact that they now charge tip (probably bc they know you wouldn't want to leave any) - it's the travesty of having no sense of pride and respect for what this place once was (which was even a bit overrated but at least tasted good), clearly not caring at all about the quality of the food, and taking advantage of poor tourists just to make a buck.

The beef and vegetables were good, but a lot of the noodles had no sauce and were therefore brittle and hard to eat.

My husband and I decided to give this place a try on a Saturday night, upon recommendations of a few of our friends. When we checked in, the hostess handed us a ticket with a number, letting us know that it would be a 30 minutes wait. But that turned into almost an hour and a half wait. We ordered both crab and pork, and pork soup dumplings. Honestly, I can deal with the wait usually if the food is really good. But it was inedible. The skin of the dumpling was thin, but it lacked elasticity, and once we picked it up with the tongs, it ripped immediately. The soup inside the dumpling had a starchy aftertaste, which was very unpleasant. If this is the best soup dumpling in New York, that's pretty pathetic.

The four orders (32 buns) of crabmeat buns were ""killer"" as usual.  We ordered clams in black bean sauce, sesame chicken, beef with broccoli, chicken Lo mein and crispy jumbo prawn in meat sauce.  All dishes were spectacular and five star.

Jacky R.,/user_details?userid=6i8IamhpWETkyeMUboCboQ,"Brooklyn, NY",7/20/2015,3.0,"Considering the wait and hype around this spot, it barely lived up to its expectation. I came in here on a Monday afternoon with a party of 2 and we were seated in about 10 minutes (not bad but other parties had to wait about 20-35 minutes). Ofc we had already planned out what to order. Pork soup dumplings, crab and pork soup dumplings, and Shanghai thick noodles. For a place that specializes in XLB's I expected to get the food in a matter of a few minutes. Over 10 minutes later our soup dumplings came and I'm not sure if it's just me but I'm not a big fan of the bok choi under the soup dumplings (I think they're used to prevent the dumplings from sticking to the traditional paper that other places use so the dumplings won't break upon contact). They get stuck on the dumplings and taste bland. The dumplings itself were alright (definitely had better in flushing and even the neighboring 21 Shanghai). The crab soup dumplings were stuffed very densely and was definitely better IMO than the pork soup dumplings. The Shanghai noodles were nothing special (very greasy too). The bill came out about 29 for 2 people so it's definitely not too pricey but was it worth the hype and wait?

There was a ton of broth inside, but it wasn't was good as din tai fung. Also, the size is bigger than a mouthful. I ended up cutting away a lot of the dough. It was okay but nothing I would crave.

Nan H.,/user_details?userid=fsbESJ0tug7p8Tw2Uh6fMQ,"Mountain View, CA",5/9/2013,4.0,I can't help making the comparison to Din Tai Fung aka DTF(not the Jersey kind)in SoCal and I have to say Joe's blows DTF out of the water. Their dumplings have so much more soup that it rivals the tang bao in Shanghai. The only dumplings better than Joe's are the Shen zen baos in Shanghai (Yang's dumplings if you ever visit Shanghai) but those are a whole other species altogether. Definitely splurge for the crab as it is much tastier than the pork.

E C.,/user_details?userid=a9ZKjooe2yW_YiES39z7hA,"Brooklyn, NY",7/21/2018,4.0,Love the soup dumplings. When you order they give you a good portion enough for two people. Be prepared to wait if you go on the weekend. There really is no real designated seating for you to wait. Parking is also terrible but the place is accessible using public transportation. Service is usually on point. You have to ask for utensils if you are not comfortable using chop sticks. If you are going by yourself or with a few people you will be seated with other people. The only problem I have is that they include the tip to the check. I don't mind tipping for good service and I throw in a little extra for superior service but if the service sucks you shouldn't be obligated. Other than that I highly recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Service was REALLY fast, non-stop and quick. Our server wasn't the nicest. Seemed like he wanted us out faster than in. The table comes with hot tea to self serve. We ordered their famous and popular soup dumplings and scallions as starters. I didn't eat any of the soup dumplings because they don't offer a vegetarian or just seafood options (*SIGH*) but everyone seemed to have loved it. The scallions were very yummy and I was tempted to order another round but saved my hunger for the main dishes to share. I went with the Stewed Mixed Vegetables and Bean Curd with Crab Sauce.

They are fantastic. They are all reasonably priced and every time I go the meal is delicious. The reason I didn't give Joe's 5-stars is I don't really care for their seating, most of the tables are all placed very close together so the wait staff do bump you or your chair even if there isn't other patrons sitting near by. Sometimes when they are very busy they sit separate parties at a 5-6 top table, which is not my favorite, hearing other conversations if you want to or not.

I'm a fan of really soupy dumplings ( I don't care if it's healthy or not), the soupier, the better. This place does just that, and with huge-sized dumplings! Came here on a Thursday at 1:30PM and there was no wait at all so we just walked right in and sat down at a big table with 2 other couples there. I'm surprised that this place has so much publicity because I don't really see how this is that different from other places but this place is def. delicious. Now...is it worth a 2-hour wait?

Very busy place, full of people. Bathrooms to the rear on the right, passing storage rooms and waiting among boxes of foodstuff. Each toilet is one person only so if door is locked, just wait.

I have been going with my family to the one on 54th St. it has been the best food every time that I go there and the service is good as well. We were stuck in the rain downtown and for the first time today we went to the Joe Shanghai downtown. The food was still the best. However, before you go to this one downtown you have to know that they will seat you wherever they want and there is a 50-50 chance that you're going to be sharing a table with other patrons. If your social person you won't mind. The other thing is that they absolutely only except cash. Do not go there unless you have more than enough cash otherwise you might be embarrassed not be able to pay the bill. The different dishes are about 4 to 5 dollars less than the one uptown, but the one uptown you can use your credit card. So you don't have to worry during the meal if you have enough money to pay for it. I will Continue frequent Joe Shanghai often but I will stick with the one uptown. Also remember that both uptown and downtown during the prime hours of lunch and dinner there is a half an hour to one hour wait time. So go off hours and you have the best of both worlds, little wait time and the best Chinese food you ever had.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Plates, utensils and cups were not clean. Food was still decent. We ordered squid with pickled vegetables, house special flat noodles, rice cake w/ pork, string beans, xiaolongbao(3 pork, 2 pork/crab) and green onion pancake. Best item was the green onion pancake which came hot and very crispy. Exactly how they should be served. Worst was the flat noodles which were like udon noodles cooked in soy with some additional toss ins. The xiaolongbao were still good, just not great. The soup was a little watered down, skins on some felt a bit thick and despite this, many were stuck together causing immediate tearing of the skin when picking up.

Helen L.,/user_details?userid=3q_YmZaB729YEsRfCdTBog,"Nutley, NJ",5/9/2015,4.0,Best soup dumplings in the city but only downfall is this location is really touristy because it's right in Chinatown. If you want a less chaotic dining experience go to the one in flushing. You won't be seated until your entire party arrives but DEFINITELY put your name in so once those slow pokes arrive you get priority seating. I find the crab soup dumplings are better than the regular but that's just me. Get the pan fried noodles as well. The Szechuan tofu dish is BOMB if you're into tofu.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Tina A.,/user_details?userid=ydnieBbgL0Dghnc5CDHLXw,"Smithtown, NY",2/22/2013,3.0,"The soup dumplings were good and seafood panfried noodles were average. But, it is so Americanized, and I think they scam people a little bit. For example, adding a service charge on the receipt.  Plus, they make such a big deal about how amazing their dumplings are, but I can most likely walk down the block and get dumplings just as tasty.

When we finally all arrived, they told us there were no tables for us. We waited for another 45 mins and constantly asking asking the lady when will the table be ready. She would rudely ignore you and keep screaming numbers in our faces. They could never give us an approximate time on when they could seat us.

When we arrived at 4pm there was already an 45 minute wait.  We thought that was a good sign.  Found the dumplings bland.  Pork, flavor non-existant.   Crab, only taste crab no subtlety of flavor.  Ordered the braised pork shoulder, was hoping for Shanghai Pork Chops, did not see them on the menu.  Before me was placed an uncarved, non trimmed monstrosity on a bed of Spinach and brown sauce.  After trimming off the inch of fat there was maybe a serving and a half of eatable pork.  Spinach and brown Sauce were good.  Orange beef was decent.  Spicy green beans were bland no seasoning.  Should have known as the number of Ethnic Chinese eating there were vastly outnumbered by the Tourists (including myself).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The soup dumplings are not only delicious, but have the ideal soup-per-dumpling ratio. All noodle dishes here are also fabulous. Shanghai's in Chinatown embraces a family style tradition of eating with other random individuals at one table. If you're into that it can be a very fun experience of getting to know others. However, if you want the same quality meal with your significant other, I recommend going to the one in Midtown.

I don't have any experience eating them but it was delicious. The other food didn't fare as well in the popularity contest. We ordered the string beans which were fresh colorful and crispy and were stir fried for only a few minutes.The Shanghai noodles were tasty but not too sophisticated. I feel it would have been better with more veggies but perhaps that's not traditional. We also ordered a tofu dish that was average and also a deep fried flounder dish. The fish was fried so it was good but anything fried well will taste fine.

It's about 1/2 hour wait they said but I'm sure we waited for at least 45 mins. It is super packed and crowded.  We had to share a table with a party of four that was finishing their meal. Ordered the scallion pancake, shanghai flat noodle, pork soup dumplings and crab soup dumplings. The food was ok but the soup dumplings were warm at best when it came out. I kept on getting hit by the waiters when they walk by because I sat on the edge and it was so packed. When the party of 4 left, the waiters were cleaning/wiping down the table shaking the whole table while we were eating. I thought that was pretty inconsiderate. Then they seated 2 more parties of 2. Yes, that's 3 different parties of 2 in one table. Awkward. In conclusion, nothing spectacular and there are other shanghai places in CT that ain't as crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

""20...21..22...23...25"" I'm like wait, hold up she skipped us!  And my friend says, no she's prolly just looking for bigger parties, they prolly don't have 2 seaters available.  By this time we've already waited 30 minutes.  I wanna say something but my friend keeps telling me not to, that our turn will come.  After 50 minutes I'm like fawk that, I go up to the host & ask her how much longer for #24, she says ""oh I called it a long time ago, u missed it.""  WHAAAAAT?!?!!!  by this time I wanna friggin strangle her cuz HAIL to the no we did not miss nothin, me and friend were watching her like a hawk the whole time!  Ughhhj!!!  So anyways, she seats us within 10 min & we order the crab soup dumplings & scallion pancake.  Luckily they came out pretty fast... Unluckily they both tasted fricken WUTEVAS!  I'm dead serious.. and the bullshit wait had nothing to do with it... The wait actually should've made it taste even better.  First off, scallion pancake is wayyyy overly greasy & not Enuff scallion... My mamas Korean scallion pancakes takes a huge shit on these.  And the soup dumplings were seriously NOTHING SPECIAL.  The flavors did not explode in my mouth... The soup did yes, which i understand can blow a persons mind away (-__-) but I'm talking about taste & flavor here!  Smh.. I agree with most of the people that rated 1 or 2 stars.. it's totally overrated & a tourist trap",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Anna D.,/user_details?userid=qnJS95fom9M1ZXBe05kzoA,"Charlottesville, VA",5/31/2017,4.0,"Expect a long line. Grab a number and wait for your number to be called. It might seem like a long wait but will be totally worth it. And they go through the numbers pretty quick. Make sure everyone is there when they call your number otherwise they won't seat you. Know what you want to order so that you can order as soon as they seat you. We were a group of 6 but two of us ran out to get boba and they called our number but couldn't get seated until the entire group was present. Anyway! We ordered as soon as we got seated: xiao long bao (steamed buns), Shanghai noodle, scallion pancake, chicken fried rice, and dumpling soups. The xiao long baos are amazing. Be careful when you grab it from the steam basket! There's soup inside so grab the buns from the top to avoid poking a hole and loose all the soup inside. The Shanghai noodle was okay. My friend loved the scallion pancake. She thought it had a good amount of scallion flavor in it. I thought it tasted okay. Very mild in flavor. The chicken fried rice was really good. The flavor was just right. I felt like I didn't need to add any more sauce to it. It was a little too greasy though, making the rice look kinda mushy. Dumpling soup was good. Their portions are good. We weren't sure how much to order and ended up to-going half of our food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Shanen L.,/user_details?userid=lkUpGswBjo2xMWKlW-IxDg,"Jersey City, NJ",11/18/2016,3.0,"Love me some xiaolongbao. Especially on a chilly fall night. A party of 3 of us went for dinner on a Saturday evening so we already knew that we should be expecting a wait to be seated. We saw the massive crowd of people outside the shop on the otherwise empty-looking street and knew we had reached our destination. We got a number and were told the wait would be 30 minutes. I'm really not sure what the system is for seating here, a lot of people waiting seemed confused. A few times the girl would come outside and basically roll call everyone's numbers to see who was still waiting. For this reason, it's probably not a good idea to take a walk around the block while waiting for your number- they are not called in order or anything close to that. After about an hour and a half we finally got seated at a round table with 2 other parties. We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings with some beers right off the bat. Beers weren't super cheap, but dumpling price was on point. As others have noted, tip is included in your bill. Decided we would try another dish while we were there, so we also got the mapo tofu. The guy asked us if we also wanted to order rice with our mapo tofu, which was confusing since mapo tofu always comes with rice. It's not a dish you just eat straight by itself. OK, so we order some individual bowls of rice so we can eat the mapo tofu. Dumplings came first. They were very tasty and hit the spot. Slurp your heart out. No complaints with the side vinegar and ginger dipping sauce either. We finished these pretty quickly and then our mapo tofu and rice came out. The dish looked okay, but seriously lacked in any flavor (big flavor bang and numbing Szechuan peppercorn feeling is what defines mapo tofu). So this was a fail. We had to ask for the hot chili sauce and vinegar dipping sauce to mix with the tofu to even make it palatable enough to eat. We probably should have just stuck with what this restaurant specialized in- soup dumplings. We weren't a big fan of the host/waiter that kept hawking around the table, trying to pull dishes out from under you before you were even finished. It felt very uncomfortable, like he was just waiting to shove you out even though you were ordering multiple rounds of drinks and dishes and hadn't even been sitting down for a half hour yet. I understand there's a line outside, but come on, I just came from that line....after waiting for an hour and a half. Let me at least enjoy my meal in peace. Front of house staff was very friendly as we were leaving though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Susan L.,/user_details?userid=a6lxjON-VzOiI9tFZtPhmA,"Manhattan, NY",7/6/2014,4.0,"You have to wait approximately an hour before you are seated. Once you are seated, they will bring you water and ask if you want to order the xiao long bao first. Don't be surprised if they seat you next to strangers and spill water on you. Also you may not really hear what your friends are saying because it's extremely loud there. The pork and crab xiao long bao are really yummy. It has more soup than other restaurants that serves xiao long bao, but the meat is smaller. The scallion pancake is really good and wasn't that oily. The duck was really flavorful and delicious. However the vegetable wasn't that good. Overall, if you are willing to wait an hour and want xiao long bao with more soup, then you should come here. But, if you are in a rush and rather have more meat in your dumpings, then this place isn't the place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It seems like they dislike anyone who is not Asian, the server and manger really seemed to be acting like jerks but I gotta admit the food made up for it. The other highlight was their orange beef.

The prices were low but I was not impressed with their food--especially the highly reviewed soup dumplings.

It was Delicious but be careful not to burn your tongue!! We shared some scallion pancakes which were really good. My boyfriend had the Singapore chow mei fun dish which was massive. Beware that the serving sizes are for at the least two people maybe even three. The chow fun was not my favorite but it's more because I'm not a fan of the dish in general. We also tried the fried mini buns for dessert. It was just okay. I thought the Dough had a weird after taste. It also came with a side of condensed milk to dip it in. It's a crowded space but it was kinda nice sitting next to other people cause we ended up striking lots of conversation. It also seemed very authentic because there were a lot of locals there even though there were tons of tourists. The prices are VERY good.

At first, I had no clue whether if it's good or not; however, my parents told me that this place is famous and delicious, and that they even have it at flushing (if it's in flushing, you know it has some sort of standard). I ordered my childhood dishes: scallion pancakes, cold sesame noodles, and soup dumplings. My friend ordered sesame chicken and vegetable fried rice. THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE!!! So worth it for the price! I am the PICKIEST person with my scallion pancakes; I usually judge a restaurant by their scallion pancakes. THEY WERE SO CRISPY AND HOT AND FRESH AND THIN!! If you've truly tried scallion pancakes in Taiwan, you would know that it should NEVER be doughy, and have very little scallions. Joe's Shanghai NAILED it! Even my friend, who only eats american-chinese food, fell in love with it and made me promise to bring him back here to have some more. The sesame noodle was alright; they did well with the sauce but the noodle was too thick. The portions for soup dumplings, fried rice, and sesame chicken were HUGE!!!! Perfect, if not, a bit too much (which is never bad).

We needed plates, juices for kids he left for good 5 10 min we had to ask another waiter for help. Then the waiter kept taking to the people next to us the whole time in Chinese laughing and just chatting away. At one point he was kept passing my by my chair and rubbing against my back without saying anything.. I had to tell him to stop rubbing against my back every minute. He wasn't passes dishes or anything he  just kept talking to the people at the table not paying attention to us. We didn't feel comfortable at all.

Although the food was okay, the customer service was absolutely horrible. We each ordered one order of dumplings each and after waiting about 30-45 for our food and seeing multiple people around us who came in after got their food before us we finally decided to ask them about our food. My boyfriend then asks our waiter about our order and our waiter is completely rude and just says wait, nothing else. We keep waiting and waiting then after five mins ask someone else and this person just flat us ignores us, then we finally ask this girl at the counter for a manager and eventually get our food and they still forget one of our orders. This place might be great to some but my first impression after hearing so many good things about their food and coming from California absolutely sucked. Maybe they think because they already have so many good reviews they don't need to keep up with their appearance, but they should also realize people from all over the country visit New York and ""hot spots"" in New York and they should treat every one of their customers with respect, especially if they can't even get an A (they had a B rating). They also include the tip in your tab, so more of a reason to give you really bad quality customer service because there's no way I would've tipped this waiter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Very busy SMALL Chinese restaurant that's serves dumplings and several Chinese cuisine! Food taste good and price was reasonable! My only problem was the tables were so close to each other it makes you feel claustrophobic! Although the food taste good I only gave it 2 starts because I'm very very CRITICAL when it comes to CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Staff was rude in a way and when you're seated they rush to take your orders right away. The server we had knew little of the English language and he was very rude and aggressive. When the food was served not even 10 minutes you are given the check right away. It seems like they care more about your money than providing an extraordinary customer service experience.

Also it's in an alley street just south of Canal street. Surprised that they make you share a larger table with another smaller group. It makes sense when it's busy but there were other empty tables. Anyways ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings right away. Then we decided on the seafood chow mein as our other dish. It was just enough food for three girls without having to take any leftovers home. The dumplings came out quickly. I, of course, couldn't wait to try it so I actually burned my tongue a bit on my first slurp of that soup. I liked the skin was thin and there was plenty of flavorful soup inside. I couldn't really taste the crab so I would maybe just stick with the pork ones next time. I still gotto say my favorite xio long bao is still from Din Tai Fung here in California. The chow mein was a bit oily but I liked the sauce and the thick noodles. And they put a lot of seafood in there - shrimp, scallops, and squid. I felt like they should because it's like $13 for that dish and twice as much if we had just gotten the chicken or beef version. I would totally eat here again for their soup dumplings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You will need to sit next to strangers. This is not a bad thing though, but I personally prefer my own seating space and more privacy with my guest(s). Going back to their soupy dumplings, it's delicious and costs only $5 for 8 of them. It's sufficient enough for a meal, and you may not need to order anything else.

The Place is a little ""Overrated"" but definitely the best Chinese Food your money can buy. The Place is always packed, there is always a wait of 20-30 minutes, and always a line of people that spills out the door into the Street. Your Patience will be rewarded. Once your number is called, you are entering a Frenzy, the Restaurant is always super packed, you are guaranteed to sit in a table with complete strangers, Its cool I've never had a problem with it, just a bit awkward lol. There ""Soup Dumplings"" is a must, its the first thing the waiter asks you when you are seated, ""what kind of dumpling"""" Ordering these dumplings is a must. We always order the pork & crab dumplings, they come out hot and Steamy served on a steam tray, the dumplings are full of Flavor Liquid and just pop in your mouth with flavor, they are literally full of soup and are to die for, but careful because they are so hot that i always burn my mouth lol. They have an extensive menu, everything I've tried so far is pretty good, Beef with Scallions, Shrimp Fried Rice, Pan-Fried Flat Noodles and Seafood, Salt & Pepper Pork chop etc. The Staff is very attentive and service is pretty quick. This is not the Typical place where you sit for hours and spend time conversing and sipping your wine or eating desert, You almost feel the common courtesy to eat rather quickly to give courtesy to the 100 people waiting in line outside for their turn to enter and take your place next lol.

The soup in the dumpling was thick and gooey and the skin was too thick. I ordered the ones with crab and they did not have the usual crab flavor that you would expect - very disappointing! The seafood pan fried noodles were even worse because they didn't even use the right kind of noodles - the thin yellow ones that are very crispy when fried. Instead, they used these thick whitish noodles that tasted so bad that we didn't even want to finish them. I don't understand why this restaurant is so popular.

Maybe it is just because I found the dumplings to be too flavorful and fatty.  I must admit the dumplings had the most soup that I have ever seen inside a xiao long bao, but the soup got sickening.  After a few I would bite the skin, and pour the soup out into a bowl. Eventuall I started only eating the skin and tossing the meat as well.  The scallion pancake was good, but a little too doughy than what I am use to.  Joe's Shanghai was a cheap meal compared to other eats in NYC, but I still wouldn't choose to revisit this establishment.

I don't even like crab but I found the pork and crab dumplings to be superior. The rest of our food was fast and delicious as well. It's very easy to over order but it all taste delicious the next day too. Very quick service but they manage their wait like your at a deli counter so that may be a little overwhelming. It's a no frills place but the food is worth it. Be prepared to wait awhile (at least 40 min) because the word is out on Joe Shanghai's.

We ordered the scallion pancakes, pork dumplings, and shanghai noodles. All were AMAZING! It was my first time at a restaurant like this so my bf and I didn't know the way to eat the dumplings.

We each ordered different dishes with intrnt to share, but soup, appetizers and main dishes arrived all at the same time making it impossible to try to share anything. Waiters brought stacks of bowls and plates which we passed around the table. Empty dishes remained uncollected which made the table more of a garbage can than a place from which to eat food. Requests for tea refills went unanswered as did rèquests for water. Food was serviceable but nothing memorable. The din and crowd noise was headache level. Of course no credit card service and our individual checks were written in pencil on scraps of note paper. None of the waiters was able to decipher the bill or tell us the cost for individual items. So our group of seven got ripped off to the tune of more than $350. Mediocre food, absolutely the worst service since the Soviet Union went out of business.

I was planning on going to the midtown branch, but after consulting yelp I decided Chinatown would be a better choice. The wait staff is snippy and all the tables are family style so you get seated with lots of strangers but I didn't even care because the pork shainghai dumplings are so effing good. The broth is really meaty and flavorful and the sauce it comes with compliments it perfectly. We also got the pan fried vegetable noodles which were incredible. The noodles were light and crunchy, the sauce was garlicky and thick and it was filled with lots of fresh veggies. Plus the bill came to $18 for a filling meal for 2 people.

Linda L.,/user_details?userid=uCC1lkUzHP2iz2DF0z3fZw,"San Francisco, CA",10/30/2012,3.0,More like 3.5. The hot and sour soup was good. The shanghai noodles was also good. However the XLBs were ehhh. We ordered the pork and the crab. At first taste it was good but the thick skin over powers the meat and soup inside. When it sat on the table for a bit the skin got hard and certain parts became inedible. My heart still belongs to Din Tai Fung for XLBs.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

To anyone expecting anything resembling Din Tai Fung XLB, you couldn't be further from this. Even though the skin was thicker than it should be and a lot of it, every single XLB tore off the lettuce leaf, but at least that gave us a chance to see the fat scum in the broth that came out of it. What we could salvage of the broth tasted blah. The scallion pancake was thick, deep fried and soaked in oil. The crispy shredded beef was really mediocre.
