I got the rigatoni and my friend got the soup- both were delicious. As the main entree, we both ordered the steak and wanted it medium well- the portion was a bit on the smaller side and some of the cut meat pieces were not cooked fully cooked on one side- looked more like medium rare.

It was a fixed menu for Christmas Day and we ended up taking half of it home, which was great as we had dinner for the next day. But it was just a lot of (very tasty) food, too much for two people. The service was really slow but I think it's because it was Christmas and people may have been out sick. There was only one barman making cocktails for the whole restaurant so it was taking forever.

The restaurant was really packed and they had a couple of events going on so there was a little delay in our steak coming out.

I checked out the menu before coming and was excited to try this place out. The service was okay and the food good but I didn't walk away thinking it was spectacular I would come back again. There was a mixed age crowd but seemed like alot older patrons.  We sat at the bar. I was going to order wine but their optiond by the glass  and bottle was a bit all over the place with very limited options. The limited bottles also had price range from $50-$400 so not many options in an affordable price range. However, the smoking pistolas cocktail I did order was perfection. The beet said was delightful with a tumeric yogurt sauce so very colorful. The sweet and spicy chicken wings had a bit too much sauce and came whole instead of as flats and drums. So definitely alot messier to eat but the bartender did provide moist towelettes to wash our face and hands. Last, we shared the Mangalista ham pizza which had a fluffy crispy crust and tasty ham but no cheese so that was a bit of a bummer. I think this place is still trying to find its groove so maybe it will come together in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetbriar-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The cornbread is one of my favorite parts. The ambiance of the place is quite nice as well. The one part of my experience that bothered me was the service. We were seated 30 min after our reservation time. They had us sit by the bar waiting and then asked us to move just as we ordered drinks so they could move the two people at our table out there. Living in NYC neither of these things bothered me, but the moment they came to show up to our table the first thing the hostess said, rather than apologizing, was that we would only have the table for 90min.

My only gripe with it is that I wish it had more preserved veggies in it. Otherwise, the rice was perfectly sticky and chewy, and the you tiao added a nice crunchy texture.

There's like 11 seats total. The sweet soy milk was great. Perfect texture, not too sweet. The you tiao is a bit oily and extra crispy since it's double fried but goes well dipping it in the sweet  soy milk. The Lu rou fan is normally at dinner but I think they serve it pretty consistently for brunch now. It's really good.

Nailun C.,/user_details?userid=J8zwN9RmzLLXO24x1IvHyQ,"Naperville, IL",6/29/2018,4.0,My husband and I came here a bit earlier than it opened there were already a line. The place is pretty small. We were able to get in to the first round of customer to be served. The food came pretty fast. The seasoning seems a bit light. It doesn't taste bad but it is definitely not comparable to beef noodle soup in Taiwan. But it's a good place to visit if you are craving a Taiwanese beef noodle soup.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ho-foods-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I came during their soft opening and came and waited 30 minutes before the actual opening of the restaurant. The whole restaurant seats no more than 16 people, and having JUST missed the cut off for the first wave of people to be seated, we ended up waiting in the cold (we came in February) for 1.5 hours to be seated. We ordered the tofu appetizer and the rich beef noodle soup. The food came up relatively quickly, and service was really good (server/cofounder was aware of the wait and trying to minimize/effectively get people seated and fed ASAP) however the quality of the beef noodle soup was only mediocre.

I knew when I saw stuffed zucchini on the menu it was a real family style restaurant. Make sure you book early to get that though. They were sold out when we arrived at 7ish. Winners on the menu are: mouhamara, baba ghannouj, rice hashwi and chicken and batata harrah. Batata was the best I have ever had. It's made very differently in different places but they have found an incredible way. Rice hashwi was amazing and served with incredible garlic sauce my family used to make that is happiness bottled. Should be served with broken up spaghetti pieces but I think they were trying to be gluten free. No worries. They make up for it with extra servings of the slivered almonds. Delicious. Services was friendly and personable. With server being from Lebanon herself. Helps a lot. When I said I was devastated that the Kousa was sold out I really felt like the person who was seating us felt my pain.  Very loud and crowded but it ads to the vibe. The owner came to each table to check in which is always a good sign. I know what it takes to make this food so I really hope they keep it going.

The people who work there are very nice and the food is good. It's focused on sharing and is fancy cafeteria concept. So why the 3 stars? While I must commend the heroic efforts of the host, who operates under tremendous pressure, and the wait staff who do not usually get tipped at the table but still give the highest level of effort and service, and the food which is rather flavorful, the actual experience leaves a lot to be desired. A lot of burden is placed on the diner to ""order at the counter"" which basically ends up being an 20-30 minutes ordeal when they are busy. Also, the counter display with all the covered dishes cause the ordering customers to ask a lot of info about the food, further slowing down the line. There are actually sufficient staff to take orders at the table. They just need a way to organize the orders for prep. If you go during a busy time you have to wait over 30 mins for a seat then up to 30 mins to order and up to 30 mins for food. Not a relaxing experience to say the least, and for dinner service you just expect a bit more. The acoustics are also not good and they could do with some sound dampening decor/insulation. The food is good but not good enough for the ordeal to be worth it. Hoping they open for lunch / improve the operations, as I won't be back til then.

As you walk in you hear the norteños playing and greeted from those behind the counter. You have different options from asada, chicken, pork and cactus (nopals) for tacos or even quesadillas. The tortillas are freshly made and you can choose flour or corn and of course you have chilé verde (green salsa) or chilé rojo (red salsa) and you definitely can't miss having a nice refreshing aqua fresca to drink on a warm summer day. Los Tacos No. 1 really fulfilled my taco craving and definitely will be making another trip next time I'm in NYC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The corn tortillas, meat, chopped cilantro, diced onions, sliced pineapple,and guacamole tasted extremely fresh. Everything is made fresh to order. My favorite item was the chicken quesadillas on flour tortilla. The flour tortilla was perfectly thin and layered with an equally thin coating of cheese.
