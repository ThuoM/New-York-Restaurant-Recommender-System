I got the rigatoni and my friend got the soup- both were delicious. As the main entree, we both ordered the steak and wanted it medium well- the portion was a bit on the smaller side and some of the cut meat pieces were not cooked fully cooked on one side- looked more like medium rare.

It was a fixed menu for Christmas Day and we ended up taking half of it home, which was great as we had dinner for the next day. But it was just a lot of (very tasty) food, too much for two people.

Jennifer L.,/user_details?userid=_RjKq8EKmD3CYUn7pFzrsQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12/5/2021,4.0,"I would probably give this 3.5 stars but didnt want to round down. I checked out the menu before coming and was excited to try this place out. The service was okay and the food good but I didn't walk away thinking it was spectacular I would come back again. There was a mixed age crowd but seemed like alot older patrons. Â We sat at the bar. I was going to order wine but their optiond by the glass Â and bottle was a bit all over the place with very limited options. The limited bottles also had price range from $50-$400 so not many options in an affordable price range. However, the smoking pistolas cocktail I did order was perfection. The beet said was delightful with a tumeric yogurt sauce so very colorful. The sweet and spicy chicken wings had a bit too much sauce and came whole instead of as flats and drums. So definitely alot messier to eat but the bartender did provide moist towelettes to wash our face and hands. Last, we shared the Mangalista ham pizza which had a fluffy crispy crust and tasty ham but no cheese so that was a bit of a bummer. I think this place is still trying to find its groove so maybe it will come together in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetbriar-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Â I'm thrilled he has opened his own restaurant! Â With my past experience with him, I knew he'd have a hit on his hands. Â The venue itself is gorgeous and his menu is outstanding. Â The restaurant is a huge, chic, & modern space with brick, light wood, beige and green color palette. Â Upon entering there is a cozy front bar, lounge area which is great to chill with one of their amazing cocktail concoctions. Â Then past the friendly hostess stand is the larger, gorgeous bar with ample seating around 3 sides. Â The next area is the large, gorgeous dining area and the open kitchen. Â The tables are far enough apart and the staff is masked up, for those covid conscious, as I am. Â The entire staff is professional, personable, and on point with impeccable service. Â I brought my friend to celebrate her birthday and she said she felt very VIP! Â The delicious drinks came quickly and the food was absolutely delicious. Â We ordered chicken wings, brick oven kale & olive pizza, radicchio salad, and of course, the ribs and cornbread. Â Everything was presented beautifully and cooked to perfection. Â It was well worth the wait to have Bryce's food served properly in a restaurant instead of takeout (although his takeout was pretty great). Â I HIGHLY recommend a fabulous dining experience here!

Living in NYC neither of these things bothered me, but the moment they came to show up to our table the first thing the hostess said, rather than apologizing, was that we would only have the table for 90min.

Jenni W.,/user_details?userid=wzXGteSorUb1xCS9V_q3zQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/28/2018,3.0,"Upon a Saturday evening, my friend and I decided to give this beef noodle soup place a try. Growing up eating beef noodle soup as one of my favorite dishes, I had heard great things about this place and the authenticity of the restaurant. I came during their soft opening and came and waited 30 minutes before the actual opening of the restaurant. The whole restaurant seats no more than 16 people, and having JUST missed the cut off for the first wave of people to be seated, we ended up waiting in the cold (we came in February) for 1.5 hours to be seated. We ordered the tofu appetizer and the rich beef noodle soup. The food came up relatively quickly, and service was really good (server/cofounder was aware of the wait and trying to minimize/effectively get people seated and fed ASAP) however the quality of the beef noodle soup was only mediocre. I didn't think the broth was that flavorful (kinda bland) and the beef wasn't the melt in your mouth goodness that I'm familiar with at home.

The server was extremely friendly taking care of and needs I had before, during and after my meal. I ordered the beef noodle soup with wide noodles. The noodle soup is on the small side but the quality is very premium. The broth was rich and had layers of flavor. The noodles had a perfect bite to it which I never have at asian noodle places. The beef was extremely tender and soft. Although I personally prefer a fattier beef but I can see they were trying to keep it traditional to the Taiwanese roots.

It still wasn't bad though, i finished it, I just won't be back next time i have a craving. I think the yelp rating is super inflated because the service is really nice, i know my waiter was. I paid extra to get it ""rich"" which is kinda lame also because it's not like it was overwhelming in flavor and your soup should be rich to begin with. If you live in the east village that's one thing, but really, if you're looking for good taiwanese beef noodle soup you can do a lot better than this and get it much cheaper.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ho-foods-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I knew when I saw stuffed zucchini on the menu it was a real family style restaurant. Make sure you book early to get that though. They were sold out when we arrived at 7ish. Winners on the menu are: mouhamara, baba ghannouj, rice hashwi and chicken and batata harrah. Batata was the best I have ever had. It's made very differently in different places but they have found an incredible way. Rice hashwi was amazing and served with incredible garlic sauce my family used to make that is happiness bottled. Should be served with broken up spaghetti pieces but I think they were trying to be gluten free. No worries. They make up for it with extra servings of the slivered almonds. Delicious. Services was friendly and personable. With server being from Lebanon herself. Helps a lot. When I said I was devastated that the Kousa was sold out I really felt like the person who was seating us felt my pain. Â Very loud and crowded but it ads to the vibe.

The people who work there are very nice and the food is good. It's focused on sharing and is fancy cafeteria concept. So why the 3 stars? While I must commend the heroic efforts of the host, who operates under tremendous pressure, and the wait staff who do not usually get tipped at the table but still give the highest level of effort and service, and the food which is rather flavorful, the actual experience leaves a lot to be desired. A lot of burden is placed on the diner to ""order at the counter"" which basically ends up being an 20-30 minutes ordeal when they are busy. Also, the counter display with all the covered dishes cause the ordering customers to ask a lot of info about the food, further slowing down the line. There are actually sufficient staff to take orders at the table. They just need a way to organize the orders for prep. If you go during a busy time you have to wait over 30 mins for a seat then up to 30 mins to order and up to 30 mins for food. Not a relaxing experience to say the least, and for dinner service you just expect a bit more. The acoustics are also not good and they could do with some sound dampening decor/insulation. The food is good but not good enough for the ordeal to be worth it. Hoping they open for lunch / improve the operations, as I won't be back til then.

The corn tortillas, meat, chopped cilantro, diced onions, sliced pineapple,and guacamole tasted extremely fresh. Everything is made fresh to order. My favorite item was the chicken quesadillas on flour tortilla. The flour tortilla was perfectly thin and layered with an equally thin coating of cheese.
