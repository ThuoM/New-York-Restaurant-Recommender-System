If you don't have a res, you will have to wait quite a while, so I would recommend that you make a res before coming. I got the HK Kong cocktail drink and it was quite sweet, with a hint of coffee. There was a bit of whipped cream on top and it tasted like a dessert liquor drink! Would recommend. The portion was a bit small but still very cute."

We ordered the beet salad, the lobster soup, the red snapper, the chicken entree, and the corn cake. Everything was delicious with the exception of the chicken, they warned me that it was spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all, it was very salty and I could not eat more than a quarter of it. I felt that the chicken should have been deducted from my bill, but it was not. This place should have more staff to help with the service. What should have been a 90 minute dinner lasted a little over 3 hours. It took the waiter 30 minutes just to bring the check because he was so busy. The restaurant is not as big as it looks on Instagram, I would say there are about 20 tables. Therefore, there should be no reason why the service was so slow, I had plans afterwards that I needed to cancel because of the time constraint.

Sara M.,/user_details?userid=HEyFRAb-WJduUBpSYW34wA,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",2/19/2023,5.0,"10/10!!!! Yes they don't have their liquor license just yet (which seems to be the only major complaint) I would first like to address that issue. Not only are they kind enough in advance with your reservation booking to tell you this but once we entered the restaurant they reiterated this and confirmed we were okie with this. Mind you, I'm here for the food not the drinks. We did order the mock tails and they were delicious! When they do get their liquor License, i know these drinks will be amazing because the attention to detail. Also, just want to add the ice they used is 10/10 love those small ice chips for drinks. Now to the food! Myself and 3 other ladies ordered a total of 4 starters: dozen oysters, guacamole with the crickets, the beets salad and the tuna tartar. The oysters were tasty they seem to be blue point (forgot to ask but based on size and flavor...) the guacamole was good;I would have loved a more spicer version but still great. Please note it doesn't automatically come with grasshoppers that's is an add on! The grasshoppers didn't add much of a change for the flavor just a slight crunch, don't knock it until your try it! For some, I heard the guacamole is of a smaller portion, if it is your only app then yes! However, if you are ordering multiple apps I believe it was enough for 4 or less to a table. The tuna tartar was amazing, so fresh, perfect size, chopped (not minced) the flavors were so tasty with the foam center. We ended our apps with the baby beets salad. Fresh, summer like flavors in the winter very spot on for  the ""Tulum"" based ambiance. For my main, I ordered the ""Red Snapper Mone Style"" wow wow wow. Yes the portion was on the smaller end (but I was content with apps already) but the flavors are bold and beautiful. Something, I have never tasted and there is no comparison! My friends ordered the following and rated their meals a 10/10: Red Snapper Tikin-Xic Style, Sea scallops, seafood enchiladas. So from all 4 meals the Mone Style and Seafood Scallops were of smaller portion as stated earlier but never lacked the tonality of flavors. For dessert please order the corn cake! I HAVE NEVER TASTED A CORN CAKE LIKE THAT. I've ordered Mexican corn cake before and thought somewhat of a cake was going to come out but no! This was something beyond; it's texture was of like a crème brûlée. The small ice cream with it add an extra depth when tried together or separate. Over all, I'm excited to come back and continuous try other items on the menu. The ambiance was beyond beautiful the staff was attentive and very kind.

The second place wouldn't let her bring her dog in. So we walked a block down and saw Boulton & Watt and they had brunch and outdoor seating available. We sat down immediately. They even offered a bowl of water for the dog, which they brought in an actual little dog bowl. Clearly they are dog friendly. The food was fantastic and the coffee was awesome.

Tiffany A.,/user_details?userid=OIYCSJSc6vvsXOKl4lnhcg,"Queens, NY",10/10/2019,3.0,I had always heard about this place being a fun spot so I decided to head over with some friends to check it out because we were in desperate need of food and drink. We arrived on a Friday night around 6:30 and we had made a reservation at 6 and the place was empty. We got great seating and pretty good food ( the fries are deliciously seasoned). My one complaint is how crumbly the burger was but that could've been my own fault for opting to not get the cheese (which was probably the glue that would hold it together). Besides the crumbly burger it was still good and our drinks were great! Loved the fun names. It definitely started to get crowded by the time we we left and if you wanna go to get food for dinner on a Friday night I would suggest calling ahead of time to reserve space.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered a bloody mary which was just ok and my boyfriend got a mimosa.  For entrees, the hangover sandwich & a burger. My sandwich was BEC meets BLT + avocado, onion and a creamy chipotle sauce and it was amazing. My boyfriend also swears (for the second time) that this is the best burger he's ever eaten. He customized it with mushrooms, jalapeños and cheese and he was super happy with it.  I was happy to see that they had a sour beer option so I got the du claw strawberry sour which I enjoyed as well.  Overall another good experience and we will continue to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Canny F.,/user_details?userid=UKU5x7fgNWzzdpCh3PqS0A,"Brooklyn, NY",12/17/2016,3.0,I loved the interior wood theme so I scheduled a cmb brunch date and I scored a table near the window. It was a fun seat! I ordered the veggie burger with cheddar grits. The veggie burger tasted better without the bun. The bun was too big and just added unnecessary carbs to my breakfast. The patty was more on the dry side so I was hesitant to let my date try my burger because I didn't want his first experience with a veggie burger to suck. He tried it and wasn't so fond of it. He had the steak and eggs and enjoyed his meal a great deal. How were these grits? Better than my first experience with cheesy grits in NYC but still not comparable to southern cheesy grits. I'm not sure what the south does to their grits but those are something to crave for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The corner restaurant with all open windows, cool interior decor, outdoor seating and awesome waitstaff complement the amazing food. The rosé sangria was awesome and perfect for summer. The Mac and cheese with bacon was perfection and the stone ground cheese grits rival anything in the south (and I live in the south and eat grits weekly and it is my favorite starchy side).

The atmosphere is cute; very rustic. Only cons-the place reeks of beer (in the summer i prefer to sit outside), and is generally really, really loud (also why I prefer to sit outside). Overall, I can get over the smell and the noise for their rocking desserts!!

We started with the mac & cheese, burrata, bone marrow toast, and brats in a blanket. I'm not a big meat eater but the brats in a blanket were absolutely delicious. We ordered the beef Wellington, squash spaghetti with eggplant meatballs, fish tacos, gnocchi, and of course the Quinoa & Kale salad.

Tara S.,/user_details?userid=-G6fkcQDewL4-5N01ZLYlg,"Queens, NY",4/19/2017,3.0,We've been wanting to go here for a while now. Went this past weekend for Easter. As the weather was in the mid 80s outdoor seating was a plus! Good menu selection. I decided to go with bacon and gritz. It has a weird name & typically comes with sausage. It was really good except I did not enjoy the reddish sauce. It tasted a bit curry like- a tad spicy. My bday had the French toast. The flavor was delightful but the texture was not for either of us. Way to gooy and slimmy. The brunch cocktails are only $6. Huge cups of coffee. The waitstaff were friendly- even left my cc behind and went back to retrieve it without a hassle. I would prob try it out for happy hour and dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I have low sodium eating habits, so that could just be me. The bibb lettuce salad was small and kind of sad looking considering the price.

We shared the fried calamari and the chips and guacamole, both of which were good but nothing extraordinary. I went with the Wild Mushroom Bolognaise which was delicious. It had pesto, ricotta cheese, and a little bit of a kick. A bunch of my friends got the fish tacos which they seemed to enjoy and another one got the Artichoke and Goat Cheese Ravioli. Overall the food was pretty good and our waitress was very nice.

Food overall is pretty good and the most important thing was that the egg was cooked how I like it which is not runny at all.(Hate me for not liking runny eggs. -.-).

Great service, took a little long but they were very accommodating once they realized we were sort of in a rush.

I totally overlooked their homemade pickle options... I have to go back for that! Between three people, we ordered the braised short rib and bone marrow (pretttyyyy rich! so if that's what you're craving you will get it), the cheese grits (which come with a poached egg and chorizo in the dish), and a side of seasonal fruit (great mix of fresh berries, pineapple, and melon).

You would think prices were extreme being where it is. It's moderate, especially with how the food taste. For brunch (no bottomless) but they are known for how amazing their Bloody Mary's are! I also think the price of the carafe of wine is reasonable ($20 for at least three glasses. The steak and eggs are on point. For lunch they have happy hour specials, I was going to get a carafe but the waiter was kind enough to tell me it's cheaper to get a $6 glass of wine, which you never hear a waiter helping you out with prices. My boyfriend got a special: you get a sandwich, picked jar & a cold beer for $16, when we actually were only charged $15 for (I think because they didn't have the beer he wanted).

As she walked back she said ""oh this doesn't look good you probably aren't getting your ID back."" So I walk over to bouncer 3 a Hispanic guy who immediately gives me attitude and says he doesn't want to talk and if I want my ID to call the cops. I do and of course there busy with really problems and send me to a different help line that gave me a dial tone. After 20 mins bouncer 3 who has been nothing but rude says hey I don't have your ID. So I go bad to bouncer 2 the woman and she's trying to give be some crap that she's not allowed to give me ID back.

We wanted to see if it was a good place to come with her friends on her birthday. We were seated immediately and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The music was great, and the menu had variety. We started with the Fried Green Tomato appetizer and it was delicious. My daughter ordered the burger on a brioche roll with carmelized onions and guyere cheese and she enjoyed finishing the whole thing. I ordered the Brussels sprouts and the Kale because I wanted to leave room for dessert. Both were really good, and I don't even like Kale. For dessert we ordered the cast iron chocolate chip cookie and it was divine. We wanted to order the brownie batter in a cup but we were just too full. Enjoyed our experience and especially spending time with my daughter.

Tiffany S.,/user_details?userid=NzdmWSUyTG4As-MsEBAxhQ,"Medford, MA",4/27/2016,5.0,"Was a little busy for a weekday night, but still got drinks in a timely fashion and food. I had wine, although a short list, had good options and all the cocktails sounded very good. The atmosphere is nice, but was very loud mostly because of people. Seems like the hip spot to grab a drink with friends and catch up. I had the blackened chicken for dinner and that was the showstopper! It's a little pricey for chix  $20, but all the prices are midlevel around there, so seems like a good deal for upscale casual NY restaurant and the portion was huge. It was THE BEST chicken I've ever had in my life. The skin was blackened with spices, not Cajun not sure what, but was perfectly crisp and seasoned, while inside was perfectly cooked through, the chicken was piping hot the whole time that's how I knew it was fresh and cooked right. It all came on top of mashed potatoes with Brussel sprouts and bacon and a jus gravy sauce that was perfect. The menu is small but everything sounded super good. The bartender was very hospitable amidst being busy making drinks. Will definitely come back to try more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ok fine - however when my friend asked if there was another table available, the manager responds by saying, ""No. Every table in this place is reserved. We take reservations just like every other restaurant in this city."" Not only was this rude, he said it with an attitude and that's not even a correct statement. I've been to plenty of bars and restaurants that don't take reservations. When asking the hostess, who was dressed in sweatpants, how long a wait would be for a table, she responds, ""do you see this list (pointing to her iPad) all these people are in front of you.

The beers on tap were phenomenal. Some of the best selection I've seen in that area of the city. The service was pretty good given how much the servers probably had to duck around the crowd up front.

The decor is classy, reminiscent of The Wren or Wilfie and Nell. Refurbished wood and industrial steel set the mood, and the conversation level is usually at a medium din, louder on weekend nights. Came here for a burger and drinks with a friend...the fries were uneven. Half were crispy, the other half soggy with the right amount of seasoning on them. The burger was also pedestrian for the neighborhoods standards. The bun was a bit ....damp...if that is the correct word. Also the meat was prepared as asked however was devoid of any flavor really. Service at the bar was spotty with about 5 people there but the bartender only checking in on us after we stood up and started getting dressed to leave. Another minor caveat that I had was that my drink tab was less than the $10 credit card minimum which they didn't tell me until after my friend already paid. First, these minimums are technically illegal in NYC and secondly if there was such a minimum we should have been told that so we could have combined our tabs. Put a damper on the end of a night.

Katie E.,/user_details?userid=6V-2xBztMnO2Rk7pKKYdPQ,"New York, NY",7/14/2014,1.0,"As much as I would like to promote Boulton & Watt, I won't do it because of a poor experience that I had when it first opened. I have lived in the surrounding neighborhood for years and wanted to bring business to this establishment when it first opened. I used to run a happy hour once a week with a bunch of co-workers and friends. We work in the finance industry and are always happy to get out and spend a little bit to have a good time. We were also combining charity donations along with our drinking fun. I contacted the manager, Jaime, and explained that we were interested in hosting a happy hour at Boulton & Watt and wanted to know if they had any interest in contributing a small percentage of our final bill to a fundraiser that we were running for homeless youth in NYC. He was very enthusiastic and committed to it over email and then I stopped by the bar to introduce myself. I promoted the happy hour(s) and fundraiser to everyone and brought a rather large group that evening after work. We had a nice table in the corner near the window. The other people stood near the bar and we had a nice time ordering both food and drinks. People weren't shy to order more because they knew that a percentage was going to charity. Jaime and I had agreed to take a look at the final amount of the bill at the end of the night and he would donate a percentage based on the amount. At the end of the night, he was no where to be found and the bartender advised that he left for the night.  I emailed, called, and stopped in a few days later but he stayed out of sight and dodged my emails and calls. It was unprofessional and left me with a sour taste of the place. Since then, our firm has not done any happy hours or business with Boulton & Watt.

There was NO shortage of other helpful staff, including the hostess who helped us keep our reserved space while other people hovered in the hopes of stealing it from us. The menu looked great, but unfortunately the food wasn't amazing. However, what was lacking in taste was absolutely made up for in service. In fact, our waitress misheard a part of our order, but just let us keep the wrong thing she brought and then brought us what we actually ordered - at no charge.

After having spent several hours there for a friend's birthday party, as well as running up a tab of over $70.00, I tried to take the empty growler that I had actually paid for already. As I exited, the bouncer literally grabbed my arm in a violent and forceful manner, and informed me that I needed a top for the growler. I tried to comply by going to the bartender for a top, and the bartender refused to provide a top. The manager then came over and referred to me using several expletives.

The ménage à trois was pretty great- a flight of old fashioned, Manhattan, and Sazerac. The presentation was very cute-Manhattan came in a mini martini glass. For sides, we ordered the Coconut curry mussels with fries, and the brussels sprouts. The coconut curry was tasty and went well with the mussels-there was enough of the sauce that it could be drunk as a soup or sopped up with the abundant shredded bread pieces. The fries were nice and thick. Brussels sprouts were also good. My apple crisp salad was almost exclusively lettuce- barely any of the apples, nuts or cheese advertised.

In our ""old age"" my husband and I (as well as our friends) wanted to make sure we had a low key night where we could talk and have a place to sit while bringing in the new year. Our friend found this place and picked it due it having a live band that night. It was great! They played a nice mix of jazz and instrumental versions of famous/ classic rock songs. The service was amazing! We had a couple of rounds of mixed drinks as well as a flight of whiskey for tasting. They do know how to make a great drink. I loved my bourbon peach iced tea the best! We had some small bites to eat after the clock rang 12- deviled eggs and some fries. The fries were great! They came with 3 different types of sauces and they were all delicious. I'd love to come here on a random night as well to just hang out. The seats were comfy and the service kept us comfortable too.

Joanna S.,/user_details?userid=C24N0gLYQxdKM0hA__zhjg,"Chicago, IL",12/18/2017,5.0,"Loved it. So many reasons why but let's start off with the ambience. It was a beautiful rustic vibe put me in the mind of the show Cheers but dimmer with Christmas decorations. The host was pleasant I didn't need a reservation walked right in and was able to sit. The entire menu looked pretty good I had the chicken pot pie and it was beautiful my only con about it was that the chicken pieces were to large but other than that really no complaints. My sister had bangers & mash which was like a pork sausage in an onion jus with mash potatoes it was also amazing. It was comfort food perfect for a brisk evening. The cocktails were great the one that caught my eye was the rosé sangria and I like it my sister had the Peach Iced Tea with Bourbon it had more of a smoky taste to it not your traditional spiked tea but still good. They offered us dessert unfortunately we didn't take them up on the offer but I'm sure it's just as good as the main course. I may go back tomorrow to try the Brussels that we kept smelling!

The pub had a cozy feel and I could tell it was place that local neighborhood customers go to often. We got two seats at the bar and the person sitting next to me recommended the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon. This sandwich was so different from the norm. The bread was thick and crunchy and filled with leeks, pickled jalapeño, fontina and gruyere cheeses, and tomatoes. It also came with a piquillo dip that added another dimension to this already mouth watering sandwich. Since this place is also known for their whiskey, I had the peach bourbon iced tea which was a combination of Jim beam, peach puree, and lemon iced tea. So good that I ordered a second!  Our bartender was so sweet and very helpful and knowledgeable with my whiskey questions.

I had the roasted squash w brown butter which was delicious light and creamy the almonds gave it a nice crunch very tasty, also had the French fries fried to perfection with three homemade dipping sauces , and then I had the Siracha lime butter popped corn, it was ok I guess they didn't warm up the butter much so it was cold on the popcorn and not sure if it was popped fresh didn't seem so I'll pass on that next time.

Was interested to see if it had the feel of a british pub, having been in nyc for a whopping 2 months now! It was more than half empty but my husband and I were told by the young guy at the door we could only be seated at the bar or one of the high tables. Still he wasn't arsey about it so we sat at the bar. The whole time we were there no one else came in and even the girl who served us was surprised we hadn't been offered a table. This was a Sunday @1300, so maybe they were expecting an influx. Food was good. We both ordered mains, and wings to share. Wings were on the sweet side. My husband orders wings in most bars so he was a bit disappointed by that. Beer good. Bar itself has a nice vibe to it.

The decor was beautiful and homey and the Brunch was delicious though the drinks seemed prepared by an amateur.. We love this area as it is slightly off the beat and track and a quieter place around NYU. We asked for the salted caramel sundae as a sweet end to our meal. They were out of the said ice cream, but they brought out a delicious sundae of vanilla ice cream with caramel and chocolate sauce. It was yummy. We decided to return for Mother's day and try dinner, well what a disappointment. I ordered the flat bread pizza. For 13.00 I got a 5x3 flat bread with sauce and a dribble of buratta, here and there. I mean, where was the cheese? My family found their meal ok. We ordered the Salted Caramel ice cream sundae again and that was completely different. A schmear of an icing like chocolate around the middle of the bowl, the ice cream plopped in the center and a sprinkle of popcorn on top. That was no Sundae. Sorry to say, we will not be returning. Their food and preparation should match the care they took into the decor of this place.

It is a unique umbrella: Sage green background, pink flowers scattered about (like Old English wallpaper) with a curved, blond wood handle. Thing is, I'm 86 years old and need to use a rollator-walker, and that was the ONLY umbrella I can use--long enough to hold while allowing me to grasp the walker; a curved handle making it easier to hold onto walker. IF YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOOK IT, PLEASE RETURN IT TO THE WHITE OAK. No questions asked. This was no accident. Yes, it was raining, but if you needed an umbrella there was a selection of ORDINARY ones there. This one is special; I got it in London 15 years ago, and it's the ONLY umbrella I can use now.

I then ordered the dolsot bibimbop with beef, which was a very hearty portion that came in a sizzling hot stone bowl. The bibimbop was pretty good though the bulgolgi was somewhat dry and crumbly.

We came on Superbowl Sunday so was seated immediately upon arriving, but I've heard wait times get long. The ambiance is sleek and dimly lit, absolutely love the unique silverware and dining dishes here too. One of the highlight dishes was the colorful soup dumplings, which not only looks super cute but each color has a different flavor skin to it. They definitely play into Szechuan cuisine in making spicier flavors like chili for the red one and wasabi for the green one. The drinks here are to die for, especially the hot rose sake and oolong cocktail, which comes out in a tray/mini pitcher/cup set, reminiscent of tea ceremony vibes. Didn't get to try any of the teas here, but they have an authentic selection of high mountain oolongs that look amazing, they even label the elevations of each tea on the menu!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/uluh-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They don't take reservations so we waited about 30-45 mins to be seated. The restaurant was packed & there was a decent crowd waiting as well but it was worth it- We got the Peking duck, truffle fried rice & garlic eggplant to share + drinks!

Elissa D.,/user_details?userid=V_Yap-LA0hUixEei70GfRg,"Queens, NY",3/11/2023,5.0,"All I can say is WOW. This place gives me the flavors I'm looking for when I crave szechuan food. They had a perfect level of spicey in their dishes, enough to feel a mild sting but not too much to where you can't taste the other flavors. If you're a hot chili oil lover like me, you'll love their dishes. For our entrees we ordered the fish in hot chili oil, beef tripe in hot chili oil, eggplant in garlic sauce with woodear, and sweet and sour pork to share. For dessert, we got the rose lychee panna cotta and mango juice sago pomelo with mochi. The mango juice sago tasted fresh, and the elements in the rose lychee dessert complimented each other so well- that one was my favorite. It was rose ice cream with lychee and sweet cream cheese. Amazing. LOVED this place! I walked in here with two friends on a Friday night and although it was busy the wait was only about 20 minutes. Good service and beautiful fancy decor as well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/uluh-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Came here with two friends for brunch today, and we were a bit worried at first because we've heard about how popular this place was and didn't want to wait too long. Thankfully, 1:45 pm on a Saturday seems like an off time for them, and we were seated immediately. We ordered the scallion pancakes with beef slices, the har gow, the colorful soup dumplings, and the crab tofu. All the dishes were tasty and hearty, and we left full and happy. Specifically, I was blown away by the crab tofu: this is soft and silky tofu drenched in the most gorgeous crab and egg yolk sauce.

Loud clubby kinda music and minimalist black slate design with great lighting makes this attractive restaurant a great dining experience. The fish with spicy broth and pickled what nots was great.

The duck portions were pretty small, and some of the meat was a bit dry/tasteless (though other parts were great, oddly enough). The skin was super crispy though which I definitely enjoyed! The tea was really expensive -- $16 for a pot that could only serve 2 people -- and they didn't fully steep it before serving, so I'd recommend waiting for a bit before pouring it. The service was great though and they played some pretty good music.

They do not take reservations and the wait is notoriously long, but you can track your progress when they send you the waitlist link which is a plus, so just be sure to plan accordingly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/uluh-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jungwon S.,/user_details?userid=0yvT2bcjV_JsIwxxZAqqog,"Staten Island, NY",7/22/2022,4.0,"I was suspicious when entering the restaurant because it was spacious and didn't have many customers on Saturday afternoon. We were seated right away. The interior was modern and unique with minimal lighting. We ordered crispy duck, crab meat soup dumplings, and mapo tofu for three of us. I would say the portion size was reasonable to maybe small. Everything we ordered was great, but my personality favorite is mapo tofu. It was just the right level of spiciness and tofu was soft with tangy texture. You have to order rice bowls separately, which I would recommend doing because food is strongly seasoned and could be a little salty without rice. I would recommend this place for special occasions  but probably not for everyday hangout or quick bite, as it is more on the fancier and pricier end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/uluh-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Harshil P.,/user_details?userid=xvi81Db39YKVKaisSFjH0Q,"Parsippany, NJ",9/23/2022,5.0,"The RARE 5 star seal of approval for Uluh & their entire team! First of all, there are so many articles claiming that Uluh has the best brown sugar Peking duck -- those articles are NOT wrong! The Peking duck here is truly 10/10 -- everything from the perfectly crisp duck skin, to the tender juicy clean cuts of dark & white meat are beyond phenomenal. To take a quick second and grade the 5 major buckets (ambiance, service, cleanliness, food & price) all of them were perfect perfect perfect, hence the rare 5 stars!!! Of course, no meal is complete without soup dumplings & har grow so naturally we had a few of each as well! The ""colorful"" soup dumplings came highly recommended because they have a variety of each flavor (so we obviously got two orders so we could share) -- inclusive of a standard soup dumpling, salted yolk dumpling, crab meat dumpling, super spicy dumpling (second favorite), yam dumpling, wasabi dumpling, shrimp dumpling & my absolute favorite the black truffle dumpling!! Other than the standard sides, we also got mushroom dumplings, volcano rib & sichuan spiced lamb ribs with bones -- this was by far one of the tastiest rib combinations I've ever had -- irrespective of cuisine, truly one of the best ribs out there. Everyone comes for the Peking duck which is incredible, however the spiced lamb rib was a hit on the table & my personal favorite!

Crispy chicken was sad. Lots of peppers not much chicken. Chicken had no meat. Crispy fish with five spice was a pass. Fish was bland and had no taste.

I got sick of the crab tofu pretty quickly - while it was nice, I felt the crab flavor was too subtle and the dish overall ended up being pretty unremarkable. We also had the truffle dumplings, string beans and Sichuan chili fried chicken. Out of all the dishes the only one I'd order again would be the Sichuan chili fried chicken, but this dish alone wasn't enough to have me running back. It was more breading than chicken and all though the spice level was great (I like it really spicy) at the end of the day it was a bowl of chilis with the occasional nub of chicken rather than a bowl of chicken with chilis accompanying it. Great flavors, but overpriced for what you get and considering the amount of amazing Sichuan restaurants in NYC, I'd look elsewhere first.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/uluh-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Lola Y.,/user_details?userid=_LcqXQ2T3MwJ0a007NYtsA,"New York, NY",7/13/2022,5.0,"Absolutely loved the food here!! The food is so authentic and the quality of each dish was exceptional. My fiancé and I loved everything we got. The Peking duck skin was perfectly done, paper thin, crispy, and melt in your mouth dipped in a little bit of sugar. The meat was so tender and juicy and the crepes were also perfectly thin. The minced pork and pickled string beans with rice noodles were excellent! The portion was huge and the rice noodles had such a great bounce to them. I will say though the mala and chilis in this dish are no joke, so beware if you have a low spice tolerance! I also loved that the sauce was thin and light, yet so flavorful from the pickled string beans. We couldn't stop eating it even though we were both dying! We also got the scallion pancake with beef, which was sooo crispy and flavorful. I also loved how each piece had a dollop of sauce on the bottom of it already! Only wished it had a little more beef in it. The salty egg yolk mini pumpkin was great and definitely oozed out fast! Would highly recommend if you've never had anything with egg yolk lava custard before but I tend to eat the bun version of these a lot so might not get them again. We ended our night with the peach gum in birds nest soup. This delicate dessert completely neutralized all the spice at the end of the night! Loved the classic combination of red dates, dried longan, and goji berries. Can't wait to come back to try their other dishes!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/uluh-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sabrina L.,/user_details?userid=3Ob5GsgWl1hUlkMezfZw4A,"Marlboro, NJ",7/18/2021,4.0,Love the crab tofu here although I don't know if it's actually crab or just salted egg yolk/crab paste as there were no crab bits. The staff was always very attentive and food came out timely. Some of the dishes are a bit overpriced for what they are but others are worth it for something you can't replicate at home. Also be sure to use the restroom there is a fancy badet and heated toilet seat. The atmosphere of the restaurant is sleek and trendy.

The idea of incorporating a tea house was also very creative but I felt that it was very expensive to pay $10 for an individual tea not even a full pot. However the quality of the tea was superior.  My favorite was the pig trotters because it was boneless that's usually my main issue with it.

Zoey D.,/user_details?userid=DfIO3kmgkUrSmbQ2NfraYQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/2/2022,1.0,"Absolutely terrible service for front of the house.  We've visited a few times before and while the food is decent,  many items are unavailable on the menu; the staff service also left much to be desired. We walked in at 5:30pm and ask for a table for 5 (they don't take reservations). The hostess told us there's a table available now if we're all there and can keep the table for us for 5 mins.  I immediately got my family in while my husband park the car across the street.  I even told her it's okay if she can get us a table for 4 and can certainly order for the party while my husband parks the car. The hostess keep insisting that I calm down in a condescending tone and said she have no table for 4, only five. Once we gathered the party (no more than 3-5mins) she refused to seat us, arguing it was ""about 5mins already"" and already gave our table away, without any warning even though we stood in front of her the entire time. She clearly didn't want to service us and was being as difficult as can be to make sure we can't dine there.  Management needs to devote more time and resources to better train your service staff, or replace them with more experience professionals esepcially given the competition in the area.  There is no reason we need to endure such unprofessionalism and absolute waste of time. We definitely won't be visiting ever again and all potential patrons should know what to expect from Uluh before they decide whether their food and service is worth their time and stress going through the ordeal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/uluh-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We got the fish filet in oil sauce and it was very authentic in terms of the spiciness.

The chili oil went well with the crab tofu if you want tons spice the tofu up a bit. The Peking duck was some of the best Peking duck I've ever had. The skin was crispy and slightly sweet.

The beef is post-spicy, which means I fel spicy after sewing 2 seconds. I finished cucumber. Nice. I didn't finish pork hands.

Uluh was a nearby spot offering bubble seating during the last snowstorm and we were craving dim sum. For our party of 3 we ordered the colorful soup dumplings, Shanghai pork soup dumplings, and salted egg yolk dumplings. Can you tell we LOVE dumplings? Our waiter actually suggested this might be too many dumplings, but there is no such thing. We also got the mini pumpkin puffs and HOLY CANOLY (or should I say holy pumpkin puff?) these things were gooooood. We ended up getting 3 more (they come in a set of 2). Just try them and thank me later. We also had the purple sweet potato pancake and the brown sugar glazed Peking duck. All of it was fabulous, from the bubble to the colors of the dumplings to the bright orange crunch of the pumpkin puff. I will absolutely be returning. The only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 is because our first dinner experience (about a year prior) was not near as good. The Szechuan chili fried chicken was less chicken, mostly just chili's.

Brown Sugar Glazed Peking Duck is really good so is Uluh Dim Sum Platter. Not a place I'd frequent but it's definitely a place I'd recommend and I'd come back to from time to time.

Sherie C.,/user_details?userid=g_ryjVBNYj4l_jNXd35xPQ,"Great Neck, NY",10/30/2021,1.0,"If I could give zero stars I would. My husband and I had decided to order pick up from this restaurant. We were looking forward to try this restaurant based off the reviews. However, our experience with a simple take out order was nothing short of a NIGHTMARE. We had originally planned to have an ""in restaurant"" meal but due to the long wait (an hour), we decided to order pick up through the restaurant's own system because it said that pick up would be 30 to 35 minute. We placed our order at 7:00 p.m. The restaurant system told us that our order would be ready at 7:31 p.m. . We traveled by car and arrived at 7:30 p.m. Once we entered restaurant, we were told that the wait time is incorrect online and that the typical wait time is instead 45 minutes to 1 hour. We understood that sometimes online ordering has the incorrect information and we patiently waited. Throughout this entire time we had our 2-year-old child with us. Anyone who has children know, that children have a certain period of time that they are calm but after that period of time they become cranky and upset. We live in the upper east side and had the restaurant told us that it was eventually going to be another 40 minutes. We would have brought our child back home but there was NO COMMUNICATION at all! We eventually had to end up waiting a total of 1 hr and 40 minutes for our take out order. We were only told after this time that some of the items were not available. We waited for such a long time and did not even receive the meal we ordered. Half of the food items were cold because they were probably sitting out while the rest were being cooked. During this entire process, there was no communication between the staff or management and my family. There were no apologies. When we were finally handed our takeaway bag, We were told that they had removed some of our order and did not let us know until that moment. We are very upset with the service and professionalism of this establishment. Unfortunately even after trying the food, we were disappointed. The soup dumplings were depleted and cold. The tofu dish was wrapped incorrectly and had made a I do mess in the bag. And the soups were all cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/uluh-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

So when I saw this restaurant, I just walked right in.  The restaurant has a nice decor and we were ushered to our table. We ordered the Peking duck, a hot and sour soup and soup dumplings. The Peking duck was the best dish. The duck was cooked and prepared perfectly and it came with a small dish of dipping sauces. My only complaints were the steamed buns that was supposed to be paired with the duck was not good. I love steamed buns but they didn't get the buns right. It was slightly sweet and it was chewy but it didn't compliment the duck. My hot and sour soup tasted overly sweet. I do believe that the chef mixed up the sugar and salt. The soup dumplings were tasty but the skin kept falling apart so the soup leaked out before you could sip it.  I would go back for the duck, the Peking duck is just as good as decoy's.

Earlier in the day, I called and wanted to make a reservation but this place does not take same day reservation. So I came here a bit passed 6 pm. There were only two groups of people ahead of us, but it took us more than 45 minutes to get a table. This is insane. This place is definitely very short of waiters and waitresses, like the owner is trying so hard to save money on waiters and waitresses. Also, after we sat down, I asked for a cup of hot water but the waitress totally forgot it and brought me cold water.  For some reasons, it took forever for us to get our veggie. Getting the waitresses' attention is difficult! OMG, I was having disappointment after disappointment.  This place needs to work on improving its service and hire more staff.

We ordered the Shanghai soup dumplings and the pan fried shanghai soup dumplings. I'm used to getting 6 or 8 in a portion so it was strange to me that it was only 4 for a portion. The pan fried soup dumplings were something I never tried before, so my group was excited to order it. The bottom was crispy, but the filling was unfortunately lukewarm at best and the dough was thicker than one would expect for Shanghai dumplings. The steamed soup dumplings were hot and flavorful, but again the dumpling exterior was more doughy and not the expected light and thin exterior so that threw me off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Yvette M.,/user_details?userid=6fx_GzF4Os4-hLmaYREvbw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/20/2023,1.0,"Yesterday evening my husband and I decided to come here for dinner and drinks. We chose this place since we were in the area. We wanted to try a new restaurant that wasn't too busy. When we walked in, there were about 3 or 4 small groups dining. The other half of the restaurant was empty, and that's where we were asked to sit. One of the female employees immediately handed us our menus and served us water. The other female employee was taking table orders and chatting with customers. After about 5 minutes, we were ready to order. We waited and waited, and waited some more. We looked around, made eye contact with both employees, but no one ever came over. After a few minutes, the employee who had served us water approached our table only to refill our glasses and walk away. We decided to give the staff additional time so I went to the restroom in the meantime. When I came back, I learned that the server still had not come to our table. We had waited a total of 25 MINUTES before deciding to leave. In addition to service being is terrible, the restroom smelled very filthy. This lack of cleanliness was definitely the deal breaker. That's when we decided that we needed to leave. All of this was a definite sign that we were not meant to eat there. Having two customers wait that amount of time shows how inconsiderate and unfriendly the staff can be towards their customers. Don't come here. There are better places with better service in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Of course we ordered a few sets of the dumplings along with the Shanghai salted meat with vegetable rice and the dry-fried green beans with pork. We later ordered the crab soup dumplings just because we could! Each dish was delicious. Next time I plan to try the other signature dishes. I have a feeling you can't go wrong ordering from here and this is your chance to get a taste of cuisine from the Jiangnan region of China (the menu mentions several cities in the region including Shanghai and Wuxi). They offer other more well-known dishes like kung pao chicken and orange beef, which I'm sure are very tasty, but I think before I went for those I'd like to try the Wuxi Pork Ribs and the West Lake Fish.

Frank A.,/user_details?userid=9s7AurWtJa3iV_h-gN2QGQ,"Manhattan, NY",7/31/2019,3.0,"Tipsy Shanghai is the New York sibling of a restaurant in Shanghai that was started in 1905. So with that history you would expect amazing flavors and unique Shanghai dishes. Unfortunately, the food at Tipsy Shanghai can only be described as bland and some of their menu items are more American Chinese (shrimp with lobster sauce, sweet & sour chicken, etc) than truly Chinese. The restaurant itself is very nice and the service is good, but the food is simply bland.

However it was actually a disappointment. The noodles taste ok but we waited one and half hour for the delivery(which is also annoying), so as you can imagine, all noodles stick together and became a soggy pancake. The ribs and zongzi are both very disappointing. Sour taste. Feels like they are spoiled. Our favorite is the sweet sticky rice.

Both the pan fried xiaolongbao and the shredded bean curds (tasted pre-frozen?) in chicken and shrimp broth didn't really hit home for me and were very unimpressive.

The xiaolongbao was soooooo yummy, and you could see how freshly steamed and made it was. The signature dish, Wuxi pork ribs was good and the meat was so tender it fell off the bone, but the only downside was that it was not completely flavorful throughout the entire piece. The string beans were cooked to perfection just the way I like it. But the main star would definitely be the beef noodle soup.

The soup dumplings were hot and juicy and had a hint of sweetness to the soup. The duck was clean and easy to eat, minimal mess with the bones. The rib soup was just like how mom makes it, so extra points there and the bok choy with tofu skin was fresh and clean too. Our waitresses were also on top of the water, warm lemon water, perfect for the cold day outside.

The staff is very friendly, and the food is very fresh and tastes amazing. I've tried chaat at quite a few places in NYC, and I don't think many places compare to Honest. The restaurant is cute, chic, and I love the instagrammable sign that they have inside. Great place to hangout with friends, for a quick bite, or a nice dinner.

Andrea C.,/user_details?userid=hjKox9u1LpwTHUO87IdmgA,"Delray Beach, FL",3/19/2022,3.0,"Small, unassuming place, order at front and they bring your food to your table.  It's definitely different than typical Indian food. They call it Street Food. The plates are small and meant to be shared. Everything seemed fresh, nothing frozen or reheated. Good quality ingredients. Started with bhaji pav, which is kind of a loose mashed potato curry served with buttery rolls for dipping. It was pretty tasty. We then had some samosas which I thought were just ok. Then we had paneer chili gravy which was grilled paneer cheese with veggies in a spicy sauce. That was my favorite dish. Also got something called a mango falooda which is kind of like a mango lassi but with nuts, mango ice cream, and thin noodles. Apparently it's a very popular  Indian street drink. My friend and I really didn't care for it. It actually wasn't bad, but those noodles were pretty off-putting for us. Maybe it's an acquired taste. Overall, an interesting meal, the restaurant was basic but very clean and bright and pretty, and the service was very good. But the food itself, while interesting, wasn't actually that great. I'm glad I tried it, but wouldn't rush to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/honest-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You could sit anywhere which is pretty cool. The decor is spacious, bright, and inviting. I ended up sitting in the back to look at the backyard view which was nice.

Once a manager arrived, things turned for the worst with him asking ""what do you want me to do? fire him?"" after we shared our disappointment in the prior persons tone.

Bread from NYC's iconic Orwasher's bakery ... and a few extras that we gotta mention. We opted to eat outside so we could bring our old senior dog, on her last legs, with us. The server -- so patient -- brought her a bowl of water as she splayed out, not exactly making it easy to maneuver around her.

The buttermilk pancakes, which come in a huge stack of 3, are amazing. Blueberries (for $3 extra) are non-negotiable. Those wanting more protein should try their two-egg breakfast.

Even if you're carnivorous, I recommend trying the veggie sausage - the texture and taste comes about as close to meat as I've tried and even putting that aside, it's just a really tasty ""sausage""!

As for the food - exceeded expectations. We had the burrata to start, which was rich and creamy without being too oily and paired nicely with the Albariño wine. My favorite however, was the main course - the mussels. That's what made it 5 stars for me. The mussels come in a rich buttery sauce and are amazingly flavorful. I am already craving these again. Plus, the staff are nice enough to offer you bread to dip in the sauce once you finish the mussels and the bread comes out warm! Afterwards I had to rush off to a show so we did not have time for dessert, but if it was anything like the main course I would not be surprised. :) Already planning to come back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/esme-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered a couple of entrees but the fried chicken sandwich is what's worth talking about! I got to try this amazing sandwich by accident.  The manager noticed that one of the poached eggs was kind of runny, so he gave us the fried chicken sandwich to try! This manager is an excellent manager! I would've come back just for the great service. However, the fried chicken sandwich was lightly crispy, tender and juicy! Seasoning was perfect and the strips of bacon added to the flavor. It was accompanied by hand cut fries which was also off the hook!

Esme is a lovely, cozy, high-ceilinged room, the meal was tasty and well-prepared and Nate could not have been more welcoming.

Esme is small, but with a crisp, modern design, and the massive windows in the front let in plenty of natural light. My friend ordered the savory French toast, which was even better than it sounds: two massive slices of French toast with tomato-roasted kale, poached eggs, and (what I think was) parmesan cheese. Tomatoes and kale go great together, and the large slices of bread made this a filling, but not overly heavy dish. My dish was also excellent - eggs benedict with (yes) pork belly and roast potatoes. Oh MAN was this delicious. The pork belly was cooked perfectly such that it was tender, but not too rare, and the hollandaise sauce had the right hint of tabasco sauce to complement the egg. And these potatoes, whoa! They were crispy and so well-seasoned, possibly the best brunch potatoes I've had a looooong time.

Our waitress was also very attentive, genuinely personable (not in a forced, chain-restaurant way) and extremely knowledgeable on the all the questions we asked. The only SLIGHT thing I'll say is that the chair (folding wooden ones) were a bit uncomfortable after 3 courses and after-dinner drinks.

This place is killer! Amazing food that you will dream about later! The pork belly appetizer and bruschetta are tasty, flavorful, and memorable. The flank steak and chicken and waffles are comfort food with a twist. Seriously I cannot stress how great the food was and how nice and down to earth the waitstaff was. The cocktails and dessert are also not to be missed! My favorite cocktail was the Zelda Fitzgerald ( a tasty gin number) and the dessert to beat was the grapefruit compote with sea salted Carmel (it tasted like a deconstructed playful key lime pie).

Erin C.,/user_details?userid=9cNi1wtLjxy9BHA5hegUNg,"Brooklyn, NY",10/12/2014,2.0,"I came here with my friend and we had what was a really nice experience until i got my entree. On a saturday night we only waited 20 minutes for a table, there was room at the bar so the waiting was easy, the Zelda Fitzgerald cocktail I ordered was great. We had a tomato soup with basil, a fragrant oil, and croutons,and it was delicious. I ordered the vegetable pot pie and my friend got the flat iron steak. Our dishes looked beautiful and I was so excited to take a bite of the golden crust and warm veggie filling. Instead I started eating what was all crunchy root vegetables. My pot pie was very obviously undercooked. Maybe they ran out of filling and tried to make more on the fly, i dont know. But it tasted like Half cooked veggies in a hot creamy sauce. Just...no. The onions were the worst tho and I LOVE onions tons of em in a salad but not like that in a pot pie. The pieces should be tender to the bite, flavor melting together and with the crust. I tried to enjoy the crust at least but that is like hardly any food. So for the first time in my life I had to ask to send something back and all I ordered was mashed potatoes instead. There was no apology or anything and they charged me for both items!! They finally agreed to take off the mashed potatoes. Big woop those were actually good!!! I dot mind being charged for edible food and great food! As a vet of the foodnetwork and serious eats Im really really shocked that the chef was a James Beard winner, he should know better. Maybe it was an off night but it sure ruined mine. Sad about this experience bec I was very excited about this restaurant, hopefully they don't do this to anyone else-it's super insulting. Guys srsly just dont be assholes. I've never left a place feeling so cheated and so hungry...and I'll even usually begrudgingly eat an over cooked burger or something I don't love. Ugh. Now I should go leave nice reviews for the places I enjoy and who don't insult their diners if a mistake is made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/esme-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered the fried calamari as my appetizer which was delicious. I had the Salerno Sunset which was good as well. For my entree I had the Chicken Sorrentino. The Chicken Sorrentino didn't wow me. There is way to much cheese in the dish and the mashed potatoes had no flavor. This is why I'm giving the review 4 stars. The server was nice. He kept refilling our water and ensured that when our plates were empty he would clear the table.

Shurida L.,/user_details?userid=o9AMDtTkautAP-LGaA-9_w,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/22/2022,4.0,I love that brunch is served everyday. I had the penne ala vodka with shrimp and calamari as an appetizer. The food was really good and the restaurant itself is a pretty restaurant. The only downfall was it was busy so refilling our mimosas took some time and also bottomless brunch being 60 mins sucks. I'm used to 90 mins or two hours.

Samantha M.,/user_details?userid=upV2GPOYdIy0GldCfzEofA,"Fairmount, Philadelphia, PA",2/6/2023,3.0,"I have been here twice before and both times the food was excellent! Both times I ordered the same thing - Breakfast Avocado Toast and a Pineapple Bellini. It was a great portion for the price, and the bottomless drinks are a great value - although I only ever ordered one drink and never ordered the bottomless. The only complaint I have about this restaurant is the service. On my first visit, I had no issues. However, on my recent visit a few days ago I was very unhappy with the service and attitude from the waiter. I ordered a Fried Egg on my avocado toast, as the menu stated you have a choice between Fried Egg, Scrambled, or Poached Egg. When he brought out my food, there were scrambled eggs on top of my avocado toast. I then informed him that I had ordered fried eggs, to which he told me that these were fried eggs because the eggs are fried. He went back and forth with me, trying to correct me that the term I was looking for was ""Sunny Side Up."" However, I am a chef so I think I know the difference between different styles of eggs. Also, a quick google search will show you that Fried Eggs are the same (also known as) Sunny Side Up - there are just two names for it. Once you scramble the yolk, the egg is no longer a traditional ""Fried Egg,"" but rather scrambled eggs, as you have scrambled them. So if what he served me wasn't scrambled eggs, but rather a Fried Egg, I am confused as to what their scrambled eggs look like. Although it may have been a simple mistake from the kitchen, it was the attitude and condescending attitude from the waiter that really turned me off. All he had to say was ""No worries, let me bring it back for you."" It is just strange to me that a waiter at a brunch restaurant seriously doesn't know what a Fried Egg is and has the nerve to correct me when a simple Google search proves him wrong. Even after showing him the Google search, he still insisted I was wrong. It was so strange to me! Next time I visit Court St I may just check out a different brunch spot, not to run into this waiter again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I don't know how I found out about it but I've had it bookmarked for quite awhile. Came in for an early dinner last Saturday and was not disappointed. We were seated on the back patio which is gorgeous and thee perfect vibe for a summer evening. They started us off with complimentary bruschetta which was yummy! We got the mussels and calamari to start..highly recommend both. The star of the show for me was the Bronzino. I was in lovee. It was grilled to absolute perfection and the flavors were insane. I highhlly recommend. If you don't mind deboning it yourself I'd go for the whole one instead of the filet. Service here was awesome too. You need to bring cash to this place though because they charge you when you pay by credit card --which I think is tacky btw.

I ordered Canadian eggs Benedict that came with brussels sprouts and potatoes, the brussels sprouts were OK nothing exceptional, the potatoes were good and the eggs Benedict were pretty good, not too much hollandaise sauce however, they got cold fairly quickly. I'm not sure if it was the space or just eating a bit slow. Also got the unlimited bottomless brunch which was $22 a pretty good deal and you were able to switch the drink so I started with a peach Bellini, then to a mango Bellini and I also tried a pineapple Bellini. all of them were delicious and the waiter was really on top of bringing us a new glass when we were finished.

Highly recommend this place for brunch, would like to return and try their lunch options IG: @mayzmind",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jemima L.,/user_details?userid=XGrlBv0wo-mxal10ypYF8A,"Brooklyn, NY",10/3/2021,5.0,Verde on Smith used to be one of my go to brunch spots a few years ago. I haven't been in a long time so when a friend mentioned she went and enjoyed it so much and asked would I like to have our next meet-up there I was more than willing. We went for a late weekday brunch and the weather was a bit meh so it was pretty empty that day. I ordered the shrimp fettuccine Alfredo and it was a nice portion with good flavors. I also ordered crème brûlée for dessert and a cappuccino. We were permitted to stay past the 90 min brunch seating time allowance as it was a slower day. We really enjoyed our meal. It's great to know that they have been a consistent staple all these years. I saw menu items I knew and loved from a few years back. Definitely a great option for brunch as they have weekday and weekend brunch. The wait service was very pleasant and helpful!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The carbonara was all cream and similarly flavorless. Simply not worth it. Did not finish our plates.

We were waiting pretty long for our last few round of drinks and then the waiter came up to me and my sister and said ""ok your time is up"" after not being seen for 15 mins.

Reshma B.,/user_details?userid=5d4J48WlBAM6CG3ABGvxBg,"New York, NY",12/17/2021,5.0,"Wow - 5 star experience!  My cousin is in town from SF and we were looking for a spot in this area.  I found Verde on Smith on Yelp and made a reservation for outdoor seating for 3 of us.  Because outdoor wasn't specified on OpenTable, I called to make sure and the guy who answered the phone was very nice and accommodating.  As we got closer to the date of our dinner, there was a Covid surge in NYC and the outdoor dining was even more imperative.  We grabbed drinks at Clover Club next door and headed over at 7PM on Fri.  It was not crowded at all - they let us check out the back patio - but to me it felt too enclosed, so we opted for a little ""bubble"" on the sidewalk.  It was great.  They even put a space heater in there to keep us warm.  The menu looked great - lots of options in the Italian/Mediterranean realm.  They started us with delicious bread (refilled twice) and we ordered a bottle of wine, apps (Goat Cheese Salad and Tuscan Stuffed Shrimp), entrees (Lobster Feast for them and Salmon Scaloppini for me), Creme Brulee for dessert, and Sparkling Moscato for them and Irish Coffee for me.  All of it was delicious.  We devoured everything.  Service was great - even though we were outside, they checked on us multiple times (refilling our water as needed), everyone fully masked, and even zipped up our little bubble each time they left.  We were all impressed by the food and the service and more importantly, I felt extremely comfortable with the seating during this tense time in the city.  Highly recommend this place, and even my visiting cousin told me I should come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

She made the experience great. There was also a gentleman there who was just as great but I forget his name. In addition to the excellent service. The food was so good. I had a steak eggs Benedict (for the first time) and it was so good. Also a side of French toast for the table and that was so good as well! The decor is awesome as well. We sat in the back patio area which had Christmas decor (thought that was super cute) and the inside has its own vibe. Loved it. Loved everything. Not my first time there.

Heaven ..,/user_details?userid=zLQpJmqp1aUINDo8KXA0BQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",4/6/2022,3.0,I've been to Verde on two separate occasions and on both times the food was very anticlimactic. The ambiance at night is amazing especially when dinning in the greenhouse! When I dinned for brunch I was met with more abrasive service in comparison to when I went for dinner. The workers behaved very dismissive towards me and my partner our whole brunch. During my dinner experience I may of been graced with our waiters presence once besides when our food was being brought out. Overall I don't think I will be going back which is a shame because I see the potential. Like I said the place is beautiful and if the food taste quality and service was improved upon I think this place could've been a favorite!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ate some of the fried calamari and Tuscan shrimp for appetizer. For the main course I try the #hangersteak with mashed potatoes and #salad.

Although when we arrived it was covered, the covering was retractable. Once it was cool enough it was rolled back, allowing us to enjoy the beautiful blue sky. We ordered the baked clams and burrata appetizers for the table. Both were beautifully done, the burrata was silky as expected. Our dinner orders included the pappardelle ragu and the crispy gnocchi. The ragu dish was massive. Although I was sure I couldn't finish it, it was addictive and I did! My fellow diner was in love with the gnocchi. Can't remember the desserts, but I'm not really a dessert person. What is wonderful about this place above and beyond what I've already described is the service.

We ordered bottomless brunch and I got a smoked salmon eggs benedict. My boyfriend and I also ordered crab cakes to share. For the bottomless drinks, I liked that we were able to mix and match on the drinks and they had a lot of different options/flavors (bellinis, mimosas and bloody marys). The drinks also had a good balance of alcohol and juice! The crab cakes were amazing! They were packed with crab meat and the tartar sauce wasn't even needed to highlight the flavor. My smoked salmon eggs benedict was good, but it was a little fishy for my taste. I would like to try their burger next time! The fries it came with looked really good too.

The food, however, I wouldn't say that it's authentic Italian. It may be inspired Italian food, but the spices have more of a Spanish / Latin twist to them. There was an appetizer we ordered of crab cakes and baked clams. The crab cakes were great, but the baked clams for 6 pieces were anticlimactic. There was more baked crumbs then being able to taste the clam, and two of them didn't have any clam inside of them. Each clam cost  wise was $3 a piece. They were so tiny for being that pricey. The server was kind enough to remove it from the bill because we were unsatisfied with the order of the clams. The salmon was a bit on the dry side for me and the couscous and side of broccoli rabe was flavorless. I made reservations thinking that this place was known for their seafood dishes and it was a bit of a disappointment. Maybe if there is a different approach in the kitchen and menu a bit for those specific dishes could have resulted in a better experience. The atmosphere and ambiance on the other hand was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Came here over the weekend as Family was in town and wanted a place with a hip crowd and good food. Glad we chose Verde on Smith. While I did not make a reservation and called ahead for wait time, they honored the wait which was about 20 mins on a fully packed day. People patiently waited outside to be seated. Once we were seated, we were greeted with Water and a Menu. There is a 60 min seating limit to keep the flow going, which is understandable. We started with the unlimited mimosas for $20 P/P. Given the large crowds, we were afraid that we wouldn't get our hours worth of drinks...boy was I wrong. Our server kept our glasses full as we were sipping our last sip...definitely a winner in my book!!! The platter choices were the chicken crepe with a side of scrambled eggs and turkey sausage , Pancakes and a Nutella filled dish. All dishes came out pretty quickly and were abundantly served.

On the other side they have plastic pods for each table big enough for 4 people. I prefer the pods since it's individually separated from everyone else.

The egg over avocado toast was yum!  It was runny and flavorful .  Overall the food and service was good. The workers were attentive. The only thing that I was eh about was the drinks.

I've always walked by and saw lines so I was intrigued. I ordered the crab cakes to start, they were subpar. Followed by the eggs benedict with steak. Even though the steak was perfect for my taste, the eggs were supposed to be the star of the show. Unfortunately, neither of the eggs were runny like a poached egg was supposed to be, both of them came off as more soft-boiled. My boyfriend got pancakes which were good, soft and fluffy.

Isabella S.,/user_details?userid=OYMC1X0OmRTvQkhK7M2WPQ,"Brooklyn, NY",1/23/2021,5.0,"Verde on Smith is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants and is definitely worthy of 5 stars. Every meal I've had here has been delicious from brunch to dinner. For brunch I typically get the cheesesteak sandwich and it's delicious. I love that they have bottomless mimosas but during the warmer weather days, the wait can be very long. Don't show up at 1 pm on a Saturday or Sunday and expect less than a 45 minute wait. They take your name and add it to a list and then call your name when your table is ready. For dinner I've gotten the penne vodka and the steak madeira and both were soooo good. Large portions and nicely presented. I've also tried the chicken wings, calamari and mussels and all were delicious as well. Really have no complaints! The service is always great. There has only been one time where I had bad service, but it was during brunch hour which is always so busy so I understand things can happen. They have been super accommodating and innovative during COVID and it's a shame we cannot dine indoors and further patronize this great business.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Hector J.,/user_details?userid=ux-LOou9TAKPs5ThbPmkPQ,"Brooklyn, NY",1/19/2021,5.0,"As a native New Yorker there's nothing that can stop me from eating out with my wife and child even during a pandemic. This past year has been difficult as some of our favorite places have either closed or have switched to takeout only. While surfing Instagram looking for a new breakfast spot I stumbled upon Verde on smith and was immediately excited to try it out as they had HEATED OUTDOOR SEATING!! Ofcourse I had to check out the menu and see some thoughts other YELPERS had. After a few minutes of surfing pics and reviews my wife, daughter and I jumped on the train eager to try a new spot. How this place remained unknown to me for so long pre pandemic is beyond me. My wife and I both decided to try one of their signature omelettes. She went with the Italian and I went with the Spanish. Both came With a side of potato wedges and salad. The best part for me personally was the fact that you could taste that it was fresh mozzarella cheese. This place had great food, great ambiance and an even better server. Megan was attentive but not pushy and never missed any of our subtle cues. (More water, hot sauce and ketchup and check) if the food wasn't the best I'd still come back for her service anytime.

Kuzi G.,/user_details?userid=5Qvvqu2vQdOXnhQroarKvg,"Brooklyn, NY",3/3/2021,3.0,Have always wanted to try this place and finally got to check it out recently with my husband for breakfast. The backyard garden is really nice combo or indoor outdoor and wasn't too cold - they also had heaters as well. It's a really nice space with good staff. The food however just wasn't all that. I ordered the avocado toast which just seemed to fall flat. It's sliced avocado instead of the spread style I'm accustomed to for avocado toast. My husband had the salmon eggs Benedict and he also said it was okay not great. Just seem to not be as flavorful and delicious for some pretty simple basic breakfast dishes. On a positive note they have bottomless mimosas which is great but would have been better if the staff came around more frequently to make it worth your while. Not sure we'd go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The party was all grey with no char or color on it, also unseasoned and very wet. It was on a super soggy bun falling apart. For $16 this was a terrible burger and I will bet anyone $$$$$ that it is 100% NOT Kobe beef as described, no way in hell. The meat tasted like some old chuck blend from Associated Supermarket. The worst part was it was so soggy and falling apart it couldn't even be cut in half and eaten I had to cut it up and try to eat it. Mixed greens on side has barely any dressing but has a funk to them like they were never washed. Overall $30 for burger and mimosa was a huge waste.

This restaurant literally had a line for people to be seated while all other establishments looked deserted. This is a plus, a sign of good service and food. Daughter and I waited 10-15 minutes before being seated ( would've been less, but I opted for patio seating). Once seated, we immediately saw why this place was packed.....$17 bottomless brunch w/ 90 mins mimosas!!! I ordered a billini and veggie burger which came with side salad and fries my daughter ordered gingerale and chicken fettuccini Alfredo. I've had bland veggie burgers, so was a bit nervous, but this one was well done on a toasted bun with lettuce & tomatoes. Soft and flavorful to the bite. The fries were seasoned with Cajun and a light crisp. The chicken alfredo looked well done, and chicken were evenly distributed to the pasta. It was eaten within 10 minutes!!

Lacks flavors and I could literally count the amount of tiny pieces of smoked prosciutto inside. They skimmed so much (2/5 points). (2) grilled chicken Alfredo - the chicken was dry, but ok, flavor is simple and alfredo sauce was thick and on-point. THis is the best among the 3 entrees i ordered (4/5 points). (3) Meatballs marinara - the pasta was tender, meatball was thick but dry and lacks flavor (where are the spices and herbs?), sauce was average (3/5 points).

The restaurant is small, so even with a reservation we waited about 30 minutes to be seated. However, when we were, the waitstaff and host were very accommodating. They made us a table and moved us to a larger one when it became available. Once we were settled and ordered our food, we comfortably enjoyed ourselves. Verde on Smith is clean and classy. If it was nicer out, I would have loved to take advantage of the outdoor seating option. The meals and drinks were all reasonably priced for a restaurant in Brooklyn - especially the 2-hour brunch drink deal which was only about $20 per person (significantly cheaper than other options). They were very attentive to the drink refills - you definitely get your money's worth within the time limit. The food was delicious, but the portion sizes were average with no frills. (Depending on how hungry you are, you may want to split a little something extra like we did.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We watched other tables get their food first after arriving before them. When we had enough and told the manager we would pay for our drinks and wanted to leave because of the horrible experience, he didn't apologize or anything.

Only word of advice is... check the weather for the day prior. Unfortunately for us, we sat right by the awning and had drips of water hit every single one of us the entire brunch (moreso on 1 particular seat), which was very annoying. We mentioned it to the waiter and he just smiled at us as if we were speaking a foreign language so nothing was done at all. Our glasses were nearly empty the entire time, yes we had bottomless drinks but there were a few who didn't and relied on hydrating with water. As for the food, we all enjoyed the dishes and they were fairly priced. Another thing to note is I had ordered a side of bacon that came out way too crisp. It actually was burnt so I'd requested it to be remade. I also found myself extra hungry that day, although I don't think the dish was that small but I ended up ordering an extra dish.

Cold wings. Soggy calamari. Rock hard French toast. Salty eggs. Burger and steaks were blah.

I found this gem on yelp and so I was pretty comfortable that the food would be great according to reviews.  It was my son's birthday and 95° outside with outdoor seating and my 82-year-old mother, among others. They didn't accept reservations and so I figured I would walk over and check out the restaurant and make sure that the outdoor seating would be acceptable considering it was supposed to be so hot.  There was a table that was inside but also  considered outside because the windows and wall were down. This table was perfect because you've got the cool air conditioning from inside the restaurant but we were also following the rules of sitting outside.  I asked the manager If I could have that table for the following day for lunch and explained the situation with my mom and that it was a special occasion.  I told him that I understand he doesn't accept reservations but I would gladly leave a deposit for the table.  He told me that it was not necessary and that he would make sure I had that table. He came through for us. The food, atmosphere and vibe was incredible. The service was wonderful. It was a perfect dining experience and birthday celebration and I appreciate so much that he accommodated us.  I will definitely be back:)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nicolas R.,/user_details?userid=r6xQHzikoNn8aREyuuxG4A,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9/10/2020,4.0,"So OVERALL, this place gets a solid 8/10. However, it DOESN'T mean it wasn't a rollercoaster either. They at first give you bread which was nice (they don't toast it) and they give you the most skimpiest portion of oil and olives I've ever seen. I actually almost choked on a pit because the olives weren't pitted, and I thought they were. Can definitely see that as being an issue. That's not important though. The main course of the meal I get the Seared Tuna and the linguine, which honestly was good but could use some seasoning. It wasn't exciting at all. But what was exciting enough for me to comeback was the pasta and marinara. It was very good, sauce wasn't too acidic and had olives that WERE pitted (thank god) and capers which those all come together so beautifully. But what wasn't expected was the added protein to my dish; a f**king hair! Especially during COVID I was kinda scarred. However Yetis, the server was so understanding and nice. He brought me another plate free of charge, and it was delicious. For dessert I had the tiramisu which was to die for. The bill ended up coming to only $37.

Luckily it was a beautiful day outside, so my friends and I were able to sit by the entrance and enjoy the view. The restaurant was loud though. About 8 women were there celebrating a birthday and face timing the occasion to someone. Anyway back to the important stuff. I ordered the delectable French toast with a side of sausage. It was soooooo darn good! The bread was fluffy and crisp with a hint of sweetness and beauty. I cannot wait to return for more. I also had a peach Bellini that was alright, it looked better than it tasted honestly, but I'm not much of a drinker. I will definitely return for brunch. I'm not sure if the dinner menu has changed since I last came, but I am open to trying it again. As far as service, it was great. The waiter and other staff were very helpful and kind. But we had to return a number of dishwater because it was either dirty or broken. A definite no-no but all is forgiven as the staff was very good at addressing the issues promptly.

This place really knows how to serve up a great brunch! From ambience to food to service, I haven't found a misstep yet! I was first here last month for my birthday brunch, and they treated me like a queen! My waiter was excellent! My husband is usually super hard to please, and even he really enjoyed our meal. He got the steak and eggs and I opted for the French toast. The french toast is delicious! One of my favorites all year, and I consider myself to be a french toast connoisseur. It's not an easy feat to be well portioned on thick brioche, yet not so thick that it's unpleasantly ""doughy"". They manage the right amount of lightness and don't skimp on the fruit. Loved it. My husband's meal was really well cooked and well seasoned too.  Most importantly, all the food was hot! Lukewarm food is a big pet peeve of mine, so Verde did not disappoint here. We both had the unlimited drink special (20 dollars for 2 hours) and I love that you can rotate through different deliciously flavored bellinis (mango,peach, raspberry), mimosas and Bloody Mary's. Between the two of us we tried all but the Blood Mary, and all were strong and great tasting! I went back again 2 weeks later with my family and again another home run.

I called a few days before to confirm the reservation and outdoor seating. 30 minutes before we arrive I get a text from the restaurant asking to confirm our reservation. As I was on the subway, I got the chance to answer FIVE MINUTES later. The manager then responded saying he had given our table to someone else. When we arrived at 2 for our scheduled reservation, the manager made us wait for thirty minutes. Then proceeded to sit us at a table not for 13 AND inside. I asked why we weren't outside and why we had to wait thirty minutes and the manager responded with ""you can wait another twenty minutes if you want to sit outside"". As someone who works as a server and has been a hostess, this treatment of customers with a large table and confirmed reservation was in all honesty BS. If it wasn't my birthday I would have left and gone somewhere else.

Katherine W.,/user_details?userid=oeFAs7AGJPXCHlwEX7GeCw,"Brooklyn, NY",4/12/2019,2.0,"I meant to write this review back in December when it actually happened but you know life happens. When I went here on December 22, 2018 I made a reservation for 2 people at 2pm, my friend and I arrived on time and were seated within 5 mins. Now I've always loved brunching here, the food is amazing and the wait staff are usually very attentive to the point when you do the unlimited drinks they bring you a fresh drink as soon as your previous drink is empty without you having to ask for one. When I came there that afternoon we were seated and ordered our drinks and food. Maybe 10 minutes later when were comfortable and chatting it up, the manager comes over to our table and asks if we would mind switching to another table because of a big party of people coming in that I assume didn't make the proper reservations of how many people would attend. My friend says okay before consulting with me and we move tables. They put us in the back of the restaurant, the last table by the kitchen against the wall, to say I was beyond annoyed is an understatement. When I saw another table across from us leaving, I asked if we could be moved because I didn't like our new table they said no, another big party is coming in. At that point brunch was ruined for me, the food didnt taste as good as usual and drinks werent coming as fast either. The manager didnt even come over and apologize or offer us a comp on fries or something from moving from our initial table. I just think the situation was handled poorly it was not our fault nor problem that the party that came in invited more people than they told the restuarant. I haven't been back since",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Michael T.,/user_details?userid=sSFOSIn-lEfpAeZedWFT0Q,"Brooklyn, NY",11/4/2018,1.0,Let's start from the beginning. My partner and I wanted to have a nice brunch at Verde on Smith St in Brooklyn. It was anything but... We had reservations for 1:15 and wasn't seated until 1:35... The host seated us at a table that had stains on the tablecloth as well as glasses that was drunk out of... I kindly asked for a new tablecloth like everyone else had and he assumed that I didn't want a new one?! The waiter was horrible! It took him 20-30 minutes to take our order and another 10 minutes to give us our drinks... So eventually we was served and given our food. But when my partner asked for another drink the waiter boldly said your not finished your other drink so why do you want another one?! I was thinking oh hell no! I was about to say something but my partner held his composure and I said ask for a manager! So we talked to the manager and nothing was solved unfortunately... But as of now avoid this place at all costs! But I'm not going to let horrible service mess my Sunday Funday up!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Michelle Z.,/user_details?userid=g--rxe0o-e0vaKSMnj0nzA,"New York, NY",11/16/2015,1.0,"I am basing my review on the service because the food was actually very good. However, the service was mediocre to say the least.  It was three of us and for some reason they had to take ONE chair away from the table to make it a 3 person table even though it s 4 top table. They did it to another customer as well and he was perplexed.  So me and my girlfriends tried to somehow understand why they were doing this but the owner explain they were very busy - hello I am looking around there were only 4 tables being serviced how are you busy right now. Anyways, moving on - here comes our lovely attitude fill waiter who for some reason the owner defended when he should have been corrected. We told him we couldn't understand why they couldn't move us to another table - he proceeded to make a joke that was NOT funny saying ""well what is the problem I can give you the other table and switch and it still be the same table"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So I told him - well it seems he doesn't care about his tip.  He had an attitude and his name was Luis. They was absolutely nothing pleasant about him - I would have rather have one of the other serves which were REALLY nice. One of them brought us our drinks and he practically pushed him out to take the drinks from him. He was rude and didn't have any customer service skills whatsoever. As a owner you should be able to correct your employees not let them act however they want - your business is a representation of yourself and since you approve of him as a waiter you lost and will loose plenty of customers.  I do not recommend this place and will not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I've been to many restaurants on Smith Street and have enjoyed most of them, but I have no desire to revisit this one. The servers were overly attentive when I was waiting for my boyfriend to arrive but once he arrived, we had to grab their attention every time we needed something. We shared the roasted beet appetizer, which tasted OK but would have been better if served warm. I ordered the scallop and sea urchin pasta, which was what I expected, except the scallops were shredded and cooked in the sauce. Why wouldn't they keep the scallops whole? Seemed very odd and it left me wanting more. But the worst crime was my BF's dish: the tuna. The only reason he ordered it is because he read some good reviews about it, but what they call a  ""white bean puree"" was just a bland mush of undercooked, underseasoned beans. There is no way this dish is worth $24.

Hayward L.,/user_details?userid=Vj9DChgT_sej81tDKr3yGw,"New York City, NY",6/22/2022,4.0,"Upscale, polished Italian bistro in TriBeCa. The food is high quality and the ambience is upscale yet casual. The ricotta cheese with bread and olive oil is an excellent appetizer, would definitely recommend sharing it between 3-4 people. The arugula salad with green apple is worth a try as well. For the main course, the pasta dishes are very impressive, they are simple but the texture of the pasta is perfect. The salmon main dish comes on a bed of salad, it was also very well made and has a great balance of taste but not quite as unique as the pastas.

Lucy M.,/user_details?userid=siMTjT_lFs6PkAqytrDSHA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/21/2021,5.0,"Locanda Verde is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC.  I love the food, the vibe, and the service.  It's definitely one of those restaurants you go on a special occasion since it is quite pricey, but the food is so worth the money.  I've tried a bunch of dishes before, but some of my favorites are the beet salad which is probably the best beet salad you will ever have.  The green sauce with the sheep's milk yogurt and pistachio is out of this world.  Additionally, I love their pastas even though I am not a huge pasta fan.  A stand out is the crab spaghetti which had so much flavor from the red chili in the dish.  As for the secondi dishes, I love the duck breast which is cooked to just the right temperature and is so juicy and delicious in your mouth.  If I could afford it, I would eat here all the time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was hopeful that the positive reviews would not steer me wrong. We made sure to be at the restaurant 10 minutes prior to our reservation at 9:30 pm. We waited 30 minutes and had to confront the hosts two times in order to ensure that efforts were being made to seat us. While waiting, the hostess ensured that the staff would bring an entree to compensate for our long wait time. The food was very good. I wish I could say the same about the customer service. We confronted the hostess Gracie about the lack of delivery when it comes to the entree that should have been sent to the table. Her response was less than impressive as she stated, ""Okay. I will let them know."" I would hope that this restaurant would employ more customer-service oriented personnel at such a reputable restaurant.

We were almost immediately shown to a little curbside house that ultimately became our private dining room. Despite the considerable chilly wind gusting outside, our little bubble remained warm and cozy throughout our meal and our servers who had to come out in the cold were always. extremely attentive. The food was first class throughout. I had the cacio e pepe pasta, an absolutely excellent version of a dish that I've had several times before at different locations.

I work across the street and it's been on my list to try for a while. The place is small and you need a reservation for a table for lunch although bar seating is available for walk-ins. I only ordered one thing - grandmother's ravioli. My grandmother actually did make ravioli. And this dish was nothing like what grandma would do. The ravioli itself is miniature in size - a square of just over 1 inch per side. You get a bowl of only 10 or 12. There is the tiniest bit of meaty something in the center - probably the size of a peanut m&m. The meat itself isn't particularly tasty. And this is $28. Grandma's ravioli should be large and well stuffed, delicious and served in a bowl you can't hope to finish. 0 for 3. On the plus side the tomato sauce was delicious.

Ben T.,/user_details?userid=Zas1lZIBfv9ysns4-1wI9w,"ASTORIA, NY",11/25/2021,3.0,"Food was great, service was good. What ruined it was the manager. We were here for Thanksgiving and we were seated about 30-45 mins after our reservation. Despite this, within minutes of paying the bill the manager came over to our table and gave us a very fake ""how was everything?"" before she tried to kick us out to make space for other customers. Everything about her attitude was wrong. As someone who worked at a Danny Meyer restaurant for 8 years I know what good service is and this was the opposite. Very pushy and no people skills whatsoever. Very clear that she didn't care at all about the customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Then we shared the lamb meatball sliders. They were delicious. For my entree, I ordered the paccheri pasta which was made in a ragu sauce and provolone. It was amazing.

Danielle L.,/user_details?userid=ilncKuVDkJq0DyD0_dL-Ng,"New York, NY",12/1/2018,1.0,Soooo disappointed in this restaurant. I had been before and enjoyed the food. When  am back for the second time We had a terrible experience and will not return. When the restaurant sat us 30 minutes after our reservation we were very understanding that things happen.

Alex P.,/user_details?userid=YRNidsfHoHZk4kBfwtymAQ,"New York, NY",7/22/2021,2.0,"As a big fan of Andrew Carmellini and someone who had dined at the restaurant in the past, I was saddened at how the food had fallen.  In fairness, I could not tell how much of my experience last night was due to a more widespread and partly understandable ""coming-back-from-Covid"" recovery - one in which the restaurant, the people in the kitchen and the people front of house, are all still getting back on the saddle. With that however, the decline in experience was highly noticed. Focaccia Napoletana arrived tepid and soggy. A cacio e pepe was as though the chef over-salted the pasta water and forgot that the cheese used is inherently salty. The garlic chicken flavor was ok but lacked the crispiness afforded by a good last few minutes in the over (it was JUST cooked through). The highlight was Evan, the wine guy, who was welcoming, informed and genuinely passionate about Sicilian whites. I am so sorry to say that the whole experience seemed soulless, a hustle and bustle of machine-like motions designed to get food, in whatever form, to the diners. I know Carmellini's work and what he and his restaurant's are capable of. As a native Italian, I am hopeful they can take feedback on and double down on attention and focus returning to the days of more sublime experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Was able to get a reservation for 4 at 8PM on a Wednesday the night before. The restaurant is attached to a fancy boutique hotel in TriBeCa - my fiancé saw Ryan Reynolds here a couple of weeks ago, apparently him and Blake Lively were staying at the hotel  We ordered the Cod, Squid Ink Pasta, Malfadine verde, and Tagliatelle. We ordered Ricotta as an appetizer. Everything was delicious, although the cod originally was too salty. The chef made us a new one and it was perfect. The restaurant didn't charge us for the cod dish, either. Overall excellent service, delicious food, and pretty decor.

Little Spicy with peppers but perfectly al dente, fresh seafood- just cooked to perfection. Would gladly come back.

The portion sizes were excellent! The food is on the rich (delicious!) side, but they clearly kept that in mind when designing their portion size. Their plating choices were also well thought-out. Coffee was delicious and they have almond milk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Elizabeth R.,/user_details?userid=A0ViSnCdC3xklbh0bt-JjQ,"Winston-Salem, NC",8/15/2017,1.0,"We stopped into this restaurant given its 4-star reviews after a long day of walking the NYC streets.  It has a beautiful appearance and was initially an okay experience.  We waited at the bar with wine and one of the bartenders asked if we would like a spot at the bar for dinner if that opened up.  Given how hungry we were, we accepted.  After about 30 minutes we were told that they had space for us at the other end of the bar.  En route we take our name off the dining room list only to find on arrival to the other end that there is only one barstool.  We were then told that when others left that we would be seated together.  After what seemed like an eternity of waiting and another glass of wine later we decided to check on the dining room wait with the host saying that he would ""do what I can"" despite there being multiple empty tables and approaching closing time.  Needless to say we were never seated in the dining room.  Finally, a spot opened up at the bar.  The service after this was horrendous.  Not once did the bartenders (who were overhead saying that there were a lot of open tabs and that it would be a good night for them) check on us to see if we would like more wine, ask if they could get us anything or even ask how the food tasted (2 apps and 2 entrees).  The person bringing food from the kitchen seemed to be the most pleasant person there!  The food was fine but nothing to write home about.  However, perhaps we were jaded by the incredibly poor service. While we were visiting, I can promise you that we will never return to this restaurant again and have been sharing the word with all friends that may visit the city. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere as Laconda Verde is not deserving of your attention or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Visited on a Saturday night (call waaaay ahead of time for a reservation) at 9:45 PM. Was seated right away as we had a reservation. Upon being seated, I finally had a chance to look around the restaurant and appreciate the ambiance. Dimly lit, intimate, and perfect for the occasion I was there for- anniversary dinner. We started with the ricotta and crostini, and the octopus. Both were simply amazing. Must order in my opinion. Their house Prosecco was absolutely delicious as well. For our main entree, we split a mafaldine verde pasta. This was so tasty and flavorful. The ground sausage was what made the dish spectacular IMO, but both the sauce and noodles were excellent. We finished with a stone fruit cheesecake, which was, again, spectacular.

Ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were light and fluffy, but I would have liked more lemon curd - there wasn't enough for the threw pancakes we had! Also got the uvo moderva dish with poached eggs, that was delicious. The garlic potatoes were fantastic as well. Would have loved to have had some dessert but was too full. Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu. One downside was the Air-conditioning was up way too high, so it got a little uncomfortable.

Once we ordered wine, she warmed up. She was helpful to our friend who has proof allergies and identified foods he could eat by speaking with the chef. We loved the sheep milk ricotta and found it to be easily shared by the table of four. The cruising are small bites,serving two only. Not being big eaters, we were happy to share a pasta , lamb chops, and dessert, all of which were delicious. When the lamb arrived, we realized the server had never asked how we want it cooked. It was very rare, rarer than I would have liked but very tender and flavorful. We shared three desserts between four of us and agreed the pistachio cake was the best.

The attention to detail in the restaurant lay out and design is awesome and admirable.

Had to wait a little bit for a table but enjoyed wine at the bar and the wait was worth it. MUST TRY the sheep milk ricotta- i know everyone else recommends it too but it is literally that delicious. my friend got the pasta with duck and i had the pumpkin tortelli and it was phenomenal. the chocolate sourdough dessert also was amazing-never had anything like it. not a thing touched my lips tonight that i did not LOVE. cannot wait to go back again. so good!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Essentially trendy, upscale modern Italian restaurant featuring some very classic and eclectic dishes. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, including the burrata, arancini, and prawns. The prawns was our favorite appetizer. I got the paccheri octopus pasta for dinner, it was delicious!

Laura J.,/user_details?userid=JNY_D2b-RYJ-Y0o6gssAUA,"New York, NY",5/11/2019,3.0,"Have been wanting to try this place for a long time and have to say I was INCREDIBLY disappointed. I'd be remiss not to give credit where credit is due: The food was incredibly delicious but the experience left me with a very bad taste in my mouth and I won't be back. I decided to take a risk and bring a client here for lunch, booking a 12PM reservation. We were immediately sat and the service was attentive, so everything started well. Being the first warm day of summer we elected to both have wine and decided to share the ricotta appetizer (also ordering our mains at the same time). Both the wine and the ricotta arrived quickly and we enjoyed them but after an additional 30 minutes I had to flag the waiter down to ask about our mains. I was offered no apologies or explanations, he simple offered to check on the status. Fast forward another ten minutes, still no mains and no explanation form our server, and this song and dance continued until 1hr and 15 minutes into our lunch the mains arrived after repeated requests and attempts to get our servers attention, and we both had to ask for them ""to go"" as we had to leave in the next 5 minutes to make our respective meetings. I get that mistakes happen and the Kitchen may have gotten slammed. What bothered me was we were never offered an apology and no one seemed to take seriously our repeated requests to accelerate the service of our main course. It was embarrassing for me with my client, so wouldn't be able to take a chance on these guys again despite the delicious food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nayla B.,/user_details?userid=0AdKXeJfxR9_TAdeTpcrow,"Manhattan, NY",4/21/2016,4.0,"My family and I went to Locanda Verde last Sunday and thoroughly enjoyed our brunch, from the atmosphere to the food. We ordered the omelette, pasta, and pancakes. In particular, (this may sound weird amongst all the other delicious dishes) the omelette was my absolute favorite. It was fluffy but moist, and the cheese oozed out of the layers of eggs. Positioned next to the omelette was a bundle of arugula mixed in a truffle vinaigrette, and this provided the dish with some freshness and a cool bite that complemented the warm omelette. I also loved the pasta, which was cooked to al dente and mixed with melt-in-your-mouth shreds of duck! I definitely can't wait to return to this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We got one sorbet! One scoop is $10, are you kidding me? They had three flavors on the menu so we assumed that it will be three scoops, but nope one scoop! I don't think that was remotely close to being right. We asked the waiter and he said ""yup just one scoop"".

When I asked the waiter why is it pink on the inside they said that they were unable to cook it all the way without being dried out.

The steak had no flavor other than a charred taste- like eating charcoal which was smoked. The pork sandwich was bland, the only flavor was the spice mixed with the red peppers and it took over. The lamb meatball sliders had bitter tomato sauce and no noticeable cheese on them, just spicy lamb. I wanted to like this place but on both occasions I'd say the food was overpriced and the service just so-so. I have never seen so many bus boys in a restaurant I think there were 15 and they were much more helpful than the waiter, it was hard to get his attention. The onion focaccia was tasty but my boyfriend doesn't like onions and that was the only bread served. The wine was good, a nice selection.

The dishes we tried were excellent - we had a carbonara with truffles that stood out as memorable and something I would go back for.  You might want to make reservations as it was very busy even at a later hour.  Highly recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jessica G.,/user_details?userid=ayrUmM0wy9VNCP17KQfHGA,"Manhattan, NY",5/21/2017,5.0,"We had a remarkable dinner at Locanda Verde. We arrived on a Friday night around 10pm and the place was full. There was even a waitlist for a bar-seat. Luckily, we had a reservation but did have to wait a while after a reservation time which was fine. They had a great cocktail menu with a couple of Mezcal selections which was a plus for me. My bf ordered a nice scotch and commented that the Scotch selection was satisfactory as well. Once sat, the service was good although the experience was a little faster than I would have hoped for. This is one of those restaurants that the chef requires you put in your full order at once apps/dinner/desert. We really don't like that style because we like to pace our own meals but I understand why they do this to ensure turn over time for reservations. The food was great but by the time we were finishing up the restaurant was empty (around 11pm). The apps and entrees were brought out right on top of each other as we feared they would be but they were delicious so we aren't taking any points off for that. We would return to this restaurant but maybe for happy hour instead of dinner.

Great service, great food. The food is still great but the service has really taken a turn for the worse. It took 25 minutes to get our cocktails and the waitress was difficult to flag down when we needed something. I also found it really annoying that we couldn't order appetizers first THEN entrees. We had to order everything all at once which I hate doing because they never course it correctly. While the food is still great, I don't think I'll be back as the bad service has soured the experience.

Dishes ordered included the squash crostini (nothing special), beetroot carpaccio (fine), tagliatelle (luke warm when served and zero flavor), bass (also luke warm and very ""fishy""), and the dark chocolate rice pudding (tasted lovely but horrendous presentation - the kitchen needs to reconsider how to plate this dessert or take it off the menu). Upon review of the bill, I noticed my aperitivo was a shocking $42. When I questioned the charge, our server sent a smug, condescending manager to confirm the charge was correct and perhaps I just wasn't aware of what I ordered; the mansplaining was neither appreciated nor helpful. What would have been helpful would have been a heads up from the bartender that the drink I ordered was going to cost $42 so I could have enjoyed a good laugh at the asinine pricing and ordered something else instead. This was definitely the first and last time I will be eating at this restaurant. So many other wonderful options in NYC that blow this place out of the water.

Jason P.,/user_details?userid=pcNlw_pRGi0YTZxvzq9rTg,"Chicago, IL",7/12/2017,4.0,"Started off with the burrata salad and was a lovely presentation. The cheese was delicious but think out of proportion with the only few beets on the plate. Also, I found the salad a tad bit salty, which was unexpected given the typical saltiness in the cheese and beets themselves. Still, good overall. For my entree I chose the Black Sea bass which was sweeter and creamier than expected but a great cut and perfectly cooked. Notably, the accompanying vegetables - squash and zucchini - stood on their own and were just the right tenderness (no small feat). I tried the Sassafrasso house cocktail, which is rye based. Nothing offensive but nothing special either. Wanted a light red with dinner and grignolino was chilled and a great complement to my fish. They slightly chill it, which I wish more restaurants would do with light reds. The atmosphere is excellent and I was pleased to see it jumping on a Wednesday night after 9 (I realize that's more customary in NYC than in most Chicago neighborhoods). Finally, the service was strong - I sat at the bar so perhaps that's a more likely outcome but a handful of competent male servers behind the bar who knew the menu and were sufficiently but not overbearingly attentive. I'd consider going back because there was nothing wrong with the meal but a) there was nothing stand-out about the food and b) there are too many other restaurants I'd try with a $125 bill (one person, drink, salad, entree, glass of wine, dessert and espresso).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Not my experience sadly. The special crostini was very odd. Salty apricots, hmmmm? The eggplant sandwich was a disaster. Hard, old bread and so messy and watery from the eggplant it was impossible to eat. Served on a small board so you couldn't come close to using a knife and fork. I tried and failed miserably.

Our first appetizer included a hair, our first drink without alcohol and our dishes were bland (except for one dish which was salted beyond being edible and we were told was made by the chef himself - as if to say it could not be bad). Were it not for our waiter (who was gracious and amazing beyond belief) and the bar tender who kept us happy with a seemingly endless stream of hot toddys we would have left quite upset.

LV came high recommended from my mom who visits weekly so we decided to check it out for a drink at the bar. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. The female bartender on Wednesday afternoon was miserable, didn't say hi when we sat at the bar, and didn't crack a smile the entire time we were there. Then we ordered the Crostina Of The Day and she forgot to mention that it had a fish spread on it along with raw salmon. Neither myself or the three ladies I was with like raw fish and when we told her that she didn't even apologize or offer to take any cost off our bill. We decided to tip because we aren't bad people but she truly didn't deserve one. It's a shame we had a terrible experience because the atmosphere was cute and drinks were good. I told the hostesses as we were leaving but am not sure if they ever relayed the message to the manager.

The Jedi Foodi E.,/user_details?userid=_XxNSjq1W1AuLuQa73jchQ,"New York, NY",3/9/2010,4.0,"I normally would not write a restaurant review based on a brunch experience because I do not feel that a restaurant is fully represented menu-wise on Sunday from 11am - 3pm. But, if the food I had the pleasure of sampling at brunch is any indication of the items on the regular dinner menu, then I must make a return evening visit to Loconda Verde. Opened last year in the former Ago space at the swanky Greenwich Hotel, this Robert Deniro - Ken Friedman- Josh Pickard redux is the absolute quintessence of Tribeca chic. Meyer Davis Studios came in and completely renovated this vaulted cathedral to Italian bistro cooking. The room is loud and lively, features high ceilings, large windows, plush leather banquettes, and dark wood, giving it a very cozy airy atmosphere. A massive granite-topped, brasserie-style bar has been installed to promote a casual, tavern like feel. Mala and I had a 1:30 reservation and after a brief delay, we were seated in a corner banquette that gave us a glorious vista of the main dining room and its classy and fashionable clientele. The walk-in wait for a table is unfortunately long, partly in thanks to the reputations held by the kitchen's award winning chefs. Leading the charge is Andrew Carmellini (A Voce, Cafe Boulud, Le Cirque). He has assembled numerous gourmet treats to awaken the senses on a lazy Sunday morning including updated egg classics and new variations on pancakes and french toasts as well as hearty fare like Fire Roasted Garlic Chicken ($19). I ordered the Citronata brunch cocktail ($12); a refreshing blend of Aperol, Lillet and Aranciata. The warm focaccia presented as a starter was out-of-the-oven fresh and well balanced in earthy flavors. To drink with my meal, I ordered the Tre Stelle ($7). It is simply a blend of pomegranate, blood orange and Valencia orange juices. The taste was ultra sweet and robust and just what the doctor ordered to brighten my demeanor. Earlier, while waiting for our table, we saw an alluring bowl of pasta on another patron's table. After perusing the menu, we discovered it was the Bucatini with Pancetta Marinara ($17). I suggested that Mala select that as her main course and was she happy that I did so. The sauce was so authentically Italian that it transported me back to Calabria, dining with my cousins at the family table. Mala devoured it down as if she had gotten a tip on a pending famine. The service at Locanda Verde is exceptional. Our server Sarah was very pleasant and also quite patient as I had a few questions about the menu and the drinks. I ordered the Shaved Porchetta Sandwich with Grilled Onions and Provolone ($16). The pork tasted like it had been braised for months; so tender, savory and juicy. I think Chef Sara Jenkins (Porchetta) across town should start worrying about some serious competition. For dessert, there was only one simple choice to make. Pastry Chef Karen Demasco achieved fame from her tantalizing sweet creations at Tom Colicchio's flagship, Craft. Recently her Maple Budino with Candied Pecans and Apple Butternut Sorbetto ($9) was awarded Top 10 Things To Eat/Drink In NYC in TIME OUT NY which stated ""the creamy pudding, rich with cooked syrup flavor and topped with toasted, candied pecans, tastes of Autumn itself."" This dessert is, in a word, transcending. New York Magazine praises, ""Many a restaurant pastry chef dreams of opening up his or her own cozy bakery one day, far from the fast-paced restaurant fray. Karen DeMasco almost gets to fulfill that fantasy at Locanda Verde, where, in addition to sending out elegant plated desserts like her lush Maple Budino, she stocks a marble counter in the street side café with all manner of mouthwatering breakfast and afternoon muffins, scones, tarts, and cakes. There's a menu-appropriate Italian cast to confections like crumbly Nutella cookies and moist streusel-topped fig muffins, but happily, DeMasco hasn't reined in all the homespun-American impulses that made her name at Craft. Want proof? There's her dense, aromatic pumpkin-spice bread; her delicate, barely sweet toffee-date cake; and, most compelling, her tender glazed apple-cider doughnut, a paragon of the form."" I could not agree more. Brunch for two with drinks, tax and tip was $90.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Melanie M.,/user_details?userid=1GCVw2bDsOjyXVbCKyFgGw,"New York, NY",7/4/2010,5.0,"Ricotta ricotta ricotta! After perusing other's Yelp reviews as well as the Locanda Verde mention in Travel & Leisure Magazine I knew immediately to order the ricotta crostini with truffle honey, orange, and rosemary, but i was not at all prepared for just how amazing this would taste. Cheese is normally dense and heavy, but this was no ordinary cheese. The texture had the lightest airiest sensation on my tongue and it was smoother and creamier than any ricotta that I've ever tasted before. The presentation was delightfully simple (just a sprinkling of rosemary, a shiny drizzle of truffle honey, and the beautiful dark char marks on the perfectly toasted bread), as were all the other plates. My zucchini frittata was a vibrant yellow circle, minimally topped with a 3 flashes of unbelievably sweet plum tomatoes, and hints of green from the zucchini skin. But I couldn't finish the frittata as I kept going back for more helpings of that ricotta. until I had polished off every last little smug of ricotta left on the plate. I loved the decor too. It made me feel comfortable without being bland or country. The pastry display looked ready for a food photo shoot, while the large windows allowed for ample sunlight to highlight the beautiful dark wood tables. With a constantly refilled cup of coffee and some excellent conversation with a new friend, my perfect Saturday brunch was complete.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Decor is warm and market-bistro like. It's quite a scene. Lots of students at the bar and a mix of older people, hipsters and tourists at the tables. I would suggest going on a weeknight for the best crowd. I personally liked the older people and hipsters. Wine and beer is fairly priced but not the biggest pours. Food is unpretentious, with quite a few dishes made for two. I highly recommend the chicken. It is amazing... large, moist and flavorful with a nice sear on the skin. I know everyone does Brussels Sprouts but these are insane... a real standout. Servers are unpretentious and casual. My only complaint was my pumpkin ravioli could have been slightly larger and had more Sage and been even more decadent. Pretty damn good, though.

That ended today however when I had made a reservation a couple weeks in advance for 4. When we arrived we were sat at a table that could not and should not seat 4 adults. I asked the server for a possible relocation, to which she replied 'it'll be the same table somewhere else"" . This was a lie. We asked about a 4 top next to us and another and also 2 2 tops. She was dumbfounded.  They were all empty. This was my daughters birthday and to be sat at a 4 top that couldn't accommodate 3 ppl is an embarrassment.  There was no remedy by Mitch who apparently couldn't be bothered as he said nothing as we left.  I spoke with Peter, who apparently was the manager, after we'd left and appraised him of what transpired. He was kind enough but we had already had a birthday brunch ruined. There was nothing I wanted except to relay to him what occurred and maybe retrain his front office staff how to accommodate in his absence.  In my opinion it was an easy fix that was overlooked by a server and Mitch that didn't feel the need to make a simple change on our behalf. Alas, we went to another establishment but I wanted to share our experience and maybe you would consider somewhere else before you book this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Yes, you're getting top notch ingredients, prepared by skilled chefs and served by professional staff; but you may feel that your portions are a little skimpy for the price, and you aren't alone. That said, the tomato sauce in my scampi and grits brunch entree (which should really be called poached eggs with sausage and tomato sauce) occupied my thoughts for the rest of the day...they should sell that stuff by the gallon.

The sea salt, herbs and oil really provided texture to the soft cheese and bread. Locanda Verde also gave us some bruschetta which had thin tomatoes and pesto - it packed a lot of flavor for not looking like it did and was fluffy to the bite. And for the piece de resistance I split the garlic chicken for two, which had vegetables and potatoes. If a restaurant can do chicken well it is an indicator to me that they can do everything else and boy did Locanda Verde deliver. The garlic was still on the skin of the chicken so the flavor and moisture were contained and the chicken was effortless to cut into. The house wine was fantastic and we drank it up like water.

Jeffay C.,/user_details?userid=t2lcYmcuoNUWCeQLCyO5Fg,"Pelham, NY",9/27/2012,4.0,Purpose of visit: dinner with colleagues. We were 15 minutes late for our reservation but the hostess was very kind in accommodating us. Atmosphere was lively with the dining and bar area packed. We ordered appetizers broccoli rabe and mozzarella side. The mozzarella was silky smooth and delicious. Also tried the calamari with fried jalapeno peppers. Very nice and not as spicy as you would expect. Main course was branzino with spinach. Very light and seasoned very well. Service was attentive and unobtrusive. Excellent meal and atmosphere.
