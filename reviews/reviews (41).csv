The harumaki rolls were so fresh and came out piping hot. The outside was flaky and light and dipping it in the sauce just really brought it all together. The skewers were also very good I got the sampler where you can only get one of a flavor. Next time I'll grab an actual entree since these were so good and I bet other items are just a great if not better. If you do get the skewers my favorites were the ribeye and the chicken. Porkbelly (liempo) is normally my favorite but the other two took the cake. I was sitting at the bar and didn't look around much but the place was popular as expected.

Luckily we were able to run to the Duane Reade nearby to get some bug spray since there were swarms of mosquitos out there. The table they put us at looked large enough for about 5 people, but they put 7 of us there which was quite tight and uncomfortable. Some people in our party ended up ordering their own separate entrees, so when they asked if they should wait to bring out the food all together we said yes, but in the end they brought them out individually so some dishes got cold while people were waiting on food. Additionally, there was some confusion on how many rices we had ordered but the guy was nice and let us keep an extra rice without charging.  The cod katsu sisig was pretty tasty and probably my favorite dish. The Laing was nice but nothing super special. The short rib kare kare meat was extremely bland but did have a nice texture.

Kadeesha L.,/user_details?userid=t0yamaWKaSInp6AoVPmJZA,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",10/28/2022,5.0,"This was such a well done beautifully executed experience. I truly did feel like I was at a dinner party at one of my close friends houses. The dinnerware is all mismatched and hand picked. Gives a nice chill, homey vibe. The food all came out timely and everything was really enjoyable. There's only one seating per night at 7:30 and this allows everyone in the restaurant to really take their time and also engaged with the servers and the head chef. We started out with a flatbread that was topped with warm goat cheese I believe, pears and arugula. Then we had a delicious fall squash based soup with pepitas on top and a delicious herb olive oil. Next we had a beef roast with mashed potatoes topped with radicchio  and olives. This was so flavorful it tasted like it was slow cooked all day. And to top off, molten chocolate cake for dessert. My absolute favorite part of the meal was chatting with the chef. The menu is set weekly on Mondays when they shop for whats in season. This makes everything taste really intentional.

Aram A.,/user_details?userid=mhj9MAxUAAKgazVWXNu-jQ,"Oakland Gardens, NY",2/11/2018,2.0,Update: last year the quality of food has gone down. Way down. They take shortcuts and put significantly less actual zatar on the bread and just throw it on after the bread is baked which is NOT the proper way and was not how they made it when they first opened. Not one a one time mistake either.

They say the whole in the wall are the best places for the best food...its true when it comes to this place. Great customer service as soon as I came in, greeted with a smile and an explanation of the menu. I ordered the zatar with laban, which comes stuffed in a freshly made pita wrap. Everything come out of a domed oven, which is cool as you see your food items being cooked in front if you. Portions are small but the price reflects that, depending on how many items you want inside your wrap. I ordered one more, but with zatar and akawi cheese, just as good.

While not a place to sit down - Manousheh only seats about 7 - for a grab and go dinner or lunch it's excellent. They make all their sandwiches and dips fresh, so when I ordered the chicken musakkhan wrap, I was not surprised by how juicy and flavorful the pollo was. The spices felt present, but never overwhelming. At $11, the sandwich was a little expensive considering its size, but its tastiness makes it worth it.

The food is made to order, and if you check-in on yelp, you can receive a free tea or coffee. I was surprised that the wraps/flat breads were served cold. I was expecting that they would be warm given the bread is made to order. I suppose since the flat bread is so thin that it cools quite quickly after leaving the stone oven. The Lahem Bi Ajine was ok (IMO, would have been better if it wasn't cold - cold ground meat doesn't seem right). The star of the show was the zaatar with veggies & avocado. The mixture of raw veggies, herbs and olives encased in a crispy thin wrap made for several delicious bites! The 'wrap' is really large, but since the stuffing is light, you can easily finish one.

A side of Labneh was great for dipping. For the two sandwiches it was 10 dollars plus $2 for veggies and $2 for a side of labneh.

Hailing from the Levant myself (Palestinian), I hold mana'eesh pies to a high standard and Lebanese ones are known to be the best. Unfortunately, authentic, old school, delicious mana'eesh are hard (even impossible) to find outside the Levant--but this place is spot-on! My father owned a mana'eesh spot in Jordan 20+ years ago, and walking in here instantly transported me back to my father's place: tiny and busy, smelling of dough, dried thyme, and Turkish coffee. Even their bottled water is imported from the homeland! The decor is awesome too, especially the Lebanese street signage that read, in Arabic and French, ""Bleecker Street"" and ""City of New York."" We'll most definitely tell everyone we know, and be back for an authentic taste of home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/manousheh-bleecker-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I have ordered from here A LOT in the past. The avocado zatar wrap was my favorite thing, I was literally obsessed with it...but the last five or so times I have ordered it, there is hardly anything in there and one of the times the avocado was completely unripe. I'm assuming they are trying to cut costs but it would be be much better if they raised the price but maintained their quality. I would be more than happy to pay more but get quality food. My wrap was quite literally more than 50% wrap. I'm pretty sure that's not the point of a wrap. They put so little avocado and zatar in there that I don't even know what's the point of calling it an avocado and zatar wrap. I haven't ordered from here for a long time (when I used to on average twice a week) and now I remember why. I keep thinking this is a one time thing (because again, I loved this place so so much) but after my last 5 or so orders it's clear that the quality has just seriously dipped. It's a shame.

Marion P.,/user_details?userid=Yq26k-cmFfnWqOd1IyyPmg,"Yardley, PA",3/25/2023,5.0,Excellent restaurant ! Initially I was intimidated by the menu and I wasn't sure if I would like it but everything was so good! We started with gougeres which was cheesy and delicious. I didn't love the sauce that went with it (friend did). Then we had the cheese soufflé (so soft!) and the beets (my least favorite but still good). I had the salmon en croute which was really excellent. My friends had the risotto and fennel tagliatelle both also really good. We ended with creme brulee and cheesecake excellent. Our server was so nice and helpful. Ambiance was nice as well - I just didn't love that you have to walk through a hotel to go to the bathroom and had a totally different feel. Would highly recommend,https://www.yelp.com/biz/koloman-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Samika P.,/user_details?userid=LF1o1iUqc0SbaJcZR5t2jQ,"New York, NY",3/5/2023,4.0,"The entrance of Koloman is a little discrete, but when you walk in, you're greeted by a very stately, sophisticated interior. The service was impeccable - right away, they checked in our coats and took us to our table. The ambiance is slightly ruined by the crowd near the bar area, which didn't match the otherwise chic vibe of the restaurant, and the tables placed really close together. The standout here is definitely the salmon en croute - the perfectly crispy and buttery crust goes so well with the tender salmon and tangy beetroot sauce. The cheese soufflé and the gougeres (mainly bread and cheese with red wine shallots) were also noteworthy, practically melting in your mouth. I was disappointed, however, by the snapper crudo. I wasn't getting much flavor or texture in the dish. And of course, this place is extremely pricey, so the food didn't wow me the way I expected it to. Overall, though, I would recommend checking out this spot to anybody looking for a delicious salmon dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/koloman-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We split the beets ""linzer"" and the Short Rib Tafelspitz Terrine. Both were very good. The beets were fairly basic, with a bit of linzer crumble strewn in, and some creme fraiche lining the plate. The terrine was a bit more interesting, and the flavors were nice. For mains, my pal got the Schnitzel (I found this a little greasy) and I had the beautiful -- and very tasty --  Salmon En Croute. The Salmon was faultless, but not thrilling. For dessert we split the soufflé with rum and lingonberries, and it was very good, but I was a little disappointed (am I being too picky) that it wasn't served in a soufflé ramekin but a shallow dish.

Todd B.,/user_details?userid=gTWPvP2cmXIWyNLkadAMbg,"New York, NY",10/1/2022,5.0,"Everything, from start to finish, was near-perfect; even the bread service was outstanding. Celery root tartare, short rib and tafelspitz terrine, roasted duck with oranges, lingonberry soufflé: all superlative. If there was one weak link, it was the schnitzel; very good, but ordinary compared to the fireworks of the other dishes. There were long-ish waits for the first round of drinks, and between appetizer and entree courses; but the service itself was smooth, professional and attentive. The decor is beautiful, too, but the layout of the room is such that some diners will only get a view of a blank wall. Noise level can be very loud, but if you snag a booth or corner banquette, you're buffered somewhat. All in all, a terrific meal and one which I felt justified the price tag (which, honestly, was quite reasonable given the quality -- I've paid a lot more for much less).

This was incredibly rich, oozing with flavorful olive oil and spices. The salmon was excellent and the tomatoes were delicious with all the other parts of the dish.

Incredibly fresh authentic Greek food in a great location in Bushwick. Large portions and bold flavors but still super home made and simple but incredibly delicious. I got the Greek salad topped with chicken. The salad dressing was awesome and it might've been the best Greek salad I've ever had (and I've had a lot). The ingredients tasted like they grew them right there and chopped them fresh off the vine. There were huge chunks of feta in the salad. My friend and I shared the vegetarian moussaka which was a fresh take on an old classic and cake layered with grilled veggies and topped with a yummy beschamel.

I got the Lamb & Chicken Kebab platter and it was the worst lamb and chicken I've ever had. The lamb was tough, almost impossible to bite off and chew. It also had basically no flavor other than the char from it being slightly burnt / over cooked. The chicken had an okay enough taste, but was SO dry I couldn't eat it.

Must try the grilled octopus as it is a banger each time. We enjoyed the Kalamari and their cold dip platter is exquisite. I loved the Taramosalata (caviar spread) and my wife enjoyed the Melitzanosalata (eggplant dip). The tzatziki is also a winner. Try the tyrokeftedes if you like a Greek version of mozzarella sticks. The sangria is a perfect blend (not too sweet and not too watery). We also enjoyed the spinach pie and the chicken gyro. The best part of this place is the service and the owners. The atmosphere and friendly attitude washes over the entire place and is a genuine delight. Their story on how they survived the covid pandemic is inspiring and the Daily News even wrote a story about them. Take the time to try out this place. Me and my wife are not certified regulars!

Both were tasty especially the Tzatziki sauce which was great and tasty to dip the meat in. For dessert we split Galaktoboureko which was very good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Alexi C.,/user_details?userid=wkyshnQEIxySVau0TJ0T8w,"New York, NY",8/13/2018,5.0,"Saw this place 2 days ago and decided I had to try it before I left for Greece and Cyprus with the rest of my family. Yes we are Greek and this food is authentic, flavorful, and generously portioned! I've lived in Brooklyn for 5 years and I'm so happy to have finally found a good Greek spot here as we usually head up to Astoria when we have the gyro munchies! And the best part is it's in the neighborhood. The owner and the rest of his crew are very friendly and said there would be some BYOB days during the week. We didn't sit in the backyard (which is really lovely and quite spacious ) because it had just rained, but definitely next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yia-yias-taverna-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sally D.,/user_details?userid=AQCRSqE5ULCGEfc4pxuw9w,"Glen Head, NY",11/2/2019,4.0,My husband and I ate a late lunch at Yia Yia's Taverna today. We were warmly greeted by the staff and manager of the restaurant. The restaurant is clean and the menu has fantastic healthy options for all types of eaters. Our food was very good and the house white wine was amazing. Our only complaint is that the Spanikopita appetizer was very dry (overcooked) and needed a dipping sauce or some tzatziki sauce to go with it. Suggestion for the walls: someone needs to climb on top of a chair and straighten all of the beautiful photos/paintings that are  improperly hung. This restaurant is warm and inviting- we will return when in Brooklyn again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yia-yias-taverna-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
