Jennifer S.,/user_details?userid=QqZoiKd2lT4Joec-E6YCyw,"New York, NY",4/2/2023,4.0,"Xu's Public House offers some delicious dishes in a swanky setting!  I don't eat seafood so we stayed away from their extensive seafood selection. We loved everything we ordered. The snow white pork buns were exceptional. The outside is crisp but then instantly give way to a fluffy, slightly sweet dough and savory filling. We also ordered the sheng jian boa, but they were showed up by the snow white pork buns. The Shanghai soup dumplings were excellent. The dough was thick like I like it and the filling was hearty and delicious, especially dipped in the vinegar sauce. The beef chow fun was very tasty as were the sauteed pea shoots with garlic (these were even better than Han Dynasty's because they were less garlicy). The scallion pancakes and egg tarts were also good, but not as special as the other dishes. In addition to the yummy food, the service was very attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/xus-public-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

In fairness, the manager will make you a gin and tonic or a martini but that is about. There wine list is very simple, Red or White. The dim sum now seems to be brought in from outside rather than being made in house. With that said, xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) are very good.

I asked for the price for 70 people which he responded to $35/person; but according to him it is impossible to buyout the entire restaurant for 70 people. According to him, he can do 50 people. Which then I asked, is it the same price? How much will that be for 50 people? (Thinking there might be a price variance given that there are less people) which he then answered ""I already told you it's 35!"" And remarked something in Chinese thereafter. What comes next?

Given that this place gives an elevated dim sum experience compared to its China town counterparts like jing fong or golden unicorn, the communication and public relations are sub par compared to the latter mentioned. I can attest to that since I am in contact with the other dim sum places and was simply appalled by the impression and representation this man made.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/xus-public-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jessica W.,/user_details?userid=9uf4IwGMtxH3Bq-mgh7glA,"Manhattan, NY",9/27/2019,5.0,Awesome Shanghai food. I like its upscale decor immediately when walk in. Newly opened. Great place to treat friends and have a party. The service is very attentative from waitress to manager and owner. They are all hands on and take care of customers for any little problems.

Melissa H.,/user_details?userid=2VNb5XLyIfy6S5FG2ma6CQ,"Manhattan, NY",9/1/2019,5.0,"This brand new restaurant nearby union square is bound to be a gem once people step inside its doors and realize how incredible it is. The flavors of the food blew our minds, because the attention to detail and quality ingredients really shows. Not sure where to start because everything we had was amazing. My favorite dishes were the uni pastry (buttery uni topped onto a sweet flaky layered pastry) and Orange shrimp (crispy and huge shrimps with a tasty orange sauce). We also loved the Yangchow fried rice. It's made steamed instead of being cooked in a rice cooker which maintains the natural shape and flavors  of rice. This is just an example of how the extra time they put into the quality of the food really pays off. Other things to mention that we're top of the line - steamed egg topped w caviar, tiger prawn and lobster risotto, morchella esuelenta soup dumpling, squid ink shrimp dumplings, five elements tea. Last thing to mention of course is the beautifully designed interior and incredible service. We can't wait to be back as this spot really exceeded our expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/xus-public-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I didn't know why and it seemed that it happened out of no where! Regardless, time goes on and there's a new player in this space. H&H took the former Sugarburg and created a more seamless theme throughout the space. Part casual bar, part group hang spot, part semi-high end bar this spot seems to tick all the boxes for a great hang in the area. It's a different vibe than rock a rolla and union pool but it adds variety in the neighborhood with it's cleaner feel than the other bars in the area.

While the cocktail list and cocktails themselves were fine, I'd grab your beer of choice or a classic cocktail and snag a seat at the bar. From there, I'd order the broccoli tacos (they pack a ton of flavor on their own but the add a few dashes of the sauce they'll bring out and it's a flavor explosion) and also a side of fries (as long as you like em McDonalds style). That's it - that's the order. If you absolutely must have a larger meal, I think the fried chicken sandwich was quite tasty.

I'm happy to report that all the lauded praise is well earned and deserved!!  You absolutely have to have a reservation to secure a table on the weekends as they get literally overwhelmed by all of like-minded patrons waiting to get access to the seafood barrage!!  I had a 7pm reservation, but we still waited about 20 minutes for our table.  You travel downstairs to the main dining area and once we were seated, we were given an explanation of the paper menu ordering system, and we proceeded to choose a good variety of everything they had to offer.  The 115 dollar lobster option, in my opinion, is the only way to go.  Everyone at the table has to get it if one person wants it, but it is totally worth it.  One thing to consider is that they bring out dishes extremely fast, so take that into account because our table was completely filled in less than 10 minutes!!  Also, the portions are humongous, so one person can get a dish to share with the table, not everyone having to get a particular item each.  Largely, all of the food was successful, with the lobster, of course, taking center stage!!  Whether the steamed option, the fried option, or cold claws,  they nailed the cookery every single time!!  The other items like the Dungeness and Snow crab were cooked well, but a touch on the dry side.  The other items like scallops, whole fish, flat iron steak, shrimps, and salmon we enjoyed as well.  The server we had was quite friendly, and she was engaging with us thoughtfully throughout our whole meal.  Service was pretty decent as the wait staff were quick to remove empty plates and the big steamer pots that started to dominate the space and took any additional orders as we needed them.  I recommend that you skip the starches and fried items or simply order them last.  They give you 2 hrs to go in on the buffet, so you can fill up on the premium items and get those options like noodles, rice, vegetables, or anything you missed to take home.  They price it out according to what's on the table, but they were extremely fair with the calculations, so we left with a good amount of food.  They also will sing happy birthday to the lucky patron, with your meal for free with four other full price meals!  They honor your birthday meal the day before, of and the next day, which is super generous!!  We felt rushed at the end, but when we were leaving, we saw why?  There were like 80 people   waiting to try and snag a table!!!  So in that respect we gave them a pass. This restaurant is so worth a trip here, as you will leave filled to the brim and you'll already be looking forward to planning your next visit !!  Cheers to all!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/crab-house-all-you-can-eat-seafood-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We got the $80 ayce seafood option (vs the $115 option that includes lobster). There was a good variety of seafood on the menu which I appreciated. The oysters were good, very big. I mainly came for the snow crab legs, and although good, it was too salty. I prefer cajun style seafood and the snow crabs legs tasted like they were just showered with salt here. All of the seafood has a slight Asian flavor to it which was ok. Service was also not the best, we were not given any crab crackers/tools to eat the crab with until asked, which I believe should be a given at a seafood restaurant like this.

As you walk downstairs you could smell all the good seafoods being served. At first the seafood came out really quick and was still hot. After that it was a little more difficult to get our servers attention but it also started to pick up. My favorite dishes were the scallops, oysters, calamari, and Dungeness crab. The scallops were nicely buttered and cooked on the skillet. The oysters were big and fresh. There was something about the coating of the calamari that was so good! The Dungeness crab wasn't salty like the other crabs and was perfect with butter. I was nervous that we didn't eat our money's worth but with how expensive seafood is nowadays, I'd say we ate enough.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/crab-house-all-you-can-eat-seafood-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Tricia L.,/user_details?userid=5lzg8EJgf8tIOyIMMO4veA,"East Flatbush, NY",5/12/2022,2.0,Didn't really enjoy the food here as much. The old bay shrimp was the best item. The noodles and fried rice were a bit bland. The crab legs were just ok not much meat in them. The steak was cool. Overall it wasn't as good as many people said on their reviews. Yes it is all you can eat but the quality of the food could have been better. Especially for the $80 or $110 price tag.

Joanne K.,/user_details?userid=oT3PLUuSXzPxLM7DaFtHbg,"Woodside, NY",11/26/2022,2.0,I was really excited to try this place however it fell flat for me. My crabs were overcooked. And i didnt care for a lot of their sauce. If i were to ever go back I'd definitely bring my own sauce with me. Also i don't understand why everything has to come family style. Its such a waste of food. Especially if 1 thing is being ordered for 1 person. We were 2.5 people. I say half cause my daughter is 5 and eats the size of a peanut. When we ordered edamame it was a huge dim sum basket size. And it was full. I understand they want you to get full off the cheap items before you get to the seafood but if i don't wanna eat it you're just wasting it. What they should do is lower the portion sizes and just charge people less. Then maybe you would make more profit as well.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/crab-house-all-you-can-eat-seafood-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Edmond C.,/user_details?userid=SBL1yLcXBvXAxGV7r0jYdw,"Anaheim, CA",3/12/2023,4.0,"Crab House will take care of your seafood, crustacean desires. I recommend going with the lobster upgrade and everyone in your party must do the same. Go with people who will pay for the upgrade, for the waiter will not have some in your party ordering without the lobster upgrade. They only take reservations for parties of four or more, so go with people who are on time. Your reservation lapses in fifteen minutes. These things must be understood up front. Now that practical considerations are out of the way, let's talk about the feast you will experience. The sizzling steak is not to be overlooked and don't miss the various ways they prepare shrimp. Seriously, the lobster is what this place is all about and please have at it. I did and so did my friends visiting from out of town. They want to come back and so do I! Yes,they have veggies and other things like very good lobster mac n cheese, but do not overload on carbs and beverages. I kept the waitress on standby for more orders of lobster. I preferred the regular steamed lobster over the fried salt and pepper lobster tails and I kept'em coming. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is nicely divided among multiple dining rooms, but your focus will be on the lobster.

Honestly, the crab were just okay. It wasn't as sweet and decadent as quality crab, and you can taste the difference. The food was plentiful, and the service was top-notch, but at the end of the day, if I'm paying $90+ per person after tax and tip, I'd rather take that and get surf and turf or get premium crab, rather a bunch of mediocre old tasting crabs that just don't quite do it for me. I would not return, but this can be adequate for someone who is not quite as picky, and is looking to get stuffed.

Xt N Lj C.,/user_details?userid=apcLdYwjEJqQHmXyftzrvQ,"Grand Prairie, TX",9/8/2022,5.0,When in NYC and you love seafood this is a place to be . Where can you find an all you can eat seafood that includes lobster . A different style of all you can eat - a preselects menu - you order everything you want on tej first round . The pic shown are our first round . Yeah yeah yeah pricey but with the seafood - it's all worth the price trust me . The lobster OMG I ate four of them so yeah worth the price . The ambience is unlike any other unlimited food - it's booth . A bit of wait to be seated if dinner time - we waited 30 mins . On our way out heard the hostess saying 2 hr wait .

We went on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm and did the Yelp check in since we were only 2 people. We waited about 15 min until we got a table.

When they all you can eat they mean that. So come with your belly empty lol. If you want lobster it is an increase understandably. The variety of drinks are so good and super strong. My only qualm is Pattie's less than 4 there's no reservations but they do have a waitlist allocated for smaller parties.

I must say, everyone at this establishment is very kind, super s/o to our server Erica, she was great! This is the type of buffet I like and it can also get you into trouble, you check off what you want and they bring it, fresh & piping hot to your table. This is wrong on so many levels, because you don't get to walk off the first serving. Then you get a cute server like Erica, with that nice smile, bringing more of those darn order sheets to your table. You finally have to say 'No'! The food was great, all seasoned to perfection. I can't list what we ate because the order sheet is very long and that should give you an idea of what we did eat. When in NYC, give them a try because we will go back.

Maria A.,/user_details?userid=4vCmgyDDN7QxQc-EVqCoLw,"Staten Island, NY",2/6/2023,1.0,"I did not enjoy my experience at all. I was interested to see what all the hype was about but unfortunately it was not what I expected.  The group I was with was anxious to try it , and being seafood lovers thought why not try for the experience ? Well this was NOT the type of restaurant to actually enjoy tasty seafood especially at the set price they charge !  Everything was very salty . Once the order was placed, it did arrive all at once in family style  but piled up on small table -- being we were a party of 6. It was overwhelming and not enjoyable. There was no proper room to actually eat. Yes, you get crab legs  but you cannot  even enjoy them in this way. The owners / management apparently want to serve a full house but with no care / regard about customer satisfaction or comfort. More of a factory feeling , and rushing your order on table without organization. I like eating in slower pace maybe. So this was not for me . I am glad I got to try but I won't return. I also factored in maybe due to their unusual circumstances-- water pipe leaking , fire department arrival , a hand written paper bill and ( not computerized/ itemized one ) .

We tried mostly everything- shrimp garlic noodles (only came w/ a few shrimp/ good flavor), basically all of the different varieties of crab and shrimp (favorite were the crab legs), raw oysters, crab rangoon, calamari, sizzling steak (pretty good!), black bean clams( i think my favorite thing- so flavorful).

Woody C.,/user_details?userid=moWPoUOEWNHCK_QrVWBAnQ,"New York, NY",5/4/2022,5.0,"I think this might be the only AYCE lobster place in NYC. Yes it's a bit pricey, but I felt it was totally worth it. They exceeded my expectations. Everything is very fresh and cooked to order and cooked well. My favorites were the lobster, scallops and steak. Everything else I tried was still very good except for the clam chowder, which I felt could have had more clams and a creamier broth. Hope they can make this better, otherwise please take it off the menu as they already have so many other good options. Other than the hostess at the door who could have been more welcoming, service was friendly and very attentive constantly checking in and did not make you feel guilty for ordering too much. Really hope they keep it up. I see that prices have steadily been increasing, but hey they need to make a living. I don't mind as long as they keep their stellar quality. Sadly places like this that are too good to be true and don't stay around for long. AYCE places are tough to be profitable especially when so many people abuse them.

Shrimp, blue crabs and crawfish in spicy sauce. Black and pepper dungenous crab claws, snow crab legs, chicken wings, fried calamari, garlic noodles and shrimp, raw clams and oysters, hot iron steak!

It makes sense since it's all you can eat for a pretty decent price being that it's NYC. This will not cut if you're particular bout your seafood. Now I can see this being some what okay to those who don't care much for higher quality. It's not the freshest fish either and very greasy in flavor. Extremely overwhelming oily taste. The oysters were so disgusting. My friend and I almost threw up tasting it. From the ocean straight to your plate. No lemon nor sauces served along side.

The crab legs were alright, nothing to brag about and the spicy shrimp as quite good. However, what they call their famous lobster was actually a disgusting piece of food. It was said to be fresh, but tasted like it was just in the freezer and was warmed up in a microwave that's 50 years old. It was tough and so gross to eat, that we threw away all the lobster we had.

Thinking about the quality of all their food, its well over 65$ when you eat only a few. Who knows maybe you just crave crab legs and for 65$ you can get as many as you want.

I had a healthy serving of rice and shrimp left and was charged $5 to take home. I think that price was based on my portion though...Oh, I forgot about the steak!!! It is served raw in a cast iron skillet that is HOT!! When it's brought to your table it has started cooking. I flipped it one time and it was done! 30 seconds. I don't what seasoning is used but that steak is DELICIOUS! There's a small alcohol menu and drinks are $15. Wine and beer,  $6. Bathroom was SPOTLESS. I appreciate the enclosed stalls. Most of all I didn't feel rushed as with most buffets..I will be back. $55 per person, well spent!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/crab-house-all-you-can-eat-seafood-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Vanessa A.,/user_details?userid=xS05JNRW927FVqKONJyPlw,"Fair Lawn, NJ",11/3/2020,4.0,"I have to say, I'm very impressed with how the quality of their food has actually improved since Covid. We came here the first time before the pandemic, and only loved the crab legs. This time around we came for crab legs but decided to give a few things another chance. I loved the little neck clams in black bean sauce. We also enjoyed the spicy crawfish, though sadly the sauce did not soak into the meat, it was still tasty. Raw oysters have definitely improved since the last time. I'm also glad they finally got their liquor license. I do wish they had some dessert options.

We ordered - snow crab legs, Dungeness crabs, raw blue point oysters, pan seared salmon, Cajun garlic butter shrimp, mussel with black bean sauce, crab cakes, pan seared scallops, crab Rangoon, old bay shrimp, iron steak, chicken wings, broccoli in brown sauce, Cajun fries and spring rolls. Everything was great. The only thing we didn't really like were the chicken wings but otherwise there were no issues. For drinks we ordered the a few lychee passions, Hawaiian sky's, Hennessy sour and scorpion bowl. The Hawaiian sky's weren't strong and tasted like juice. Our waiter ( I believe his name was Ky or Py? I feel bad for not remembering because he was great)  was amazing. He was on top of everything.

Good servers are hard to find in fast establishments. The food seemed pretty good but What made everything go downhill was, Me and my best friend saw a mouse/ rat pass our table. We were both in shock. I've eaten at many restaurants even in the Bronx and have never seen this! Looked over to a vacant area near us and we saw another !

Stephanie L.,/user_details?userid=got0PN6oQDlMfIoCwMOZ7g,"Honolulu, HI",12/21/2019,3.0,"Just ate here. The staff is super friendly.  The restaurant just opened yesterday,  which I should have looked at more carefully when reading reviews (5 stars could have been from family members/friends at the grand opening). They tell you to try everything and then order more of what you like. However,  a lot of the dishes the portions are really big. The best dishes in my and my friend's opinion are the ones that actually were small portions, but better quality. Those were the scallops and the teriyaki salmon. Those both had only 2 pieces, so one for each of us. The sea bass was good, but it's a whole fish (small/medium size),  a lot for a taster. The steak was also tasty (8 pieces on a sizzling platter). The Dungeness crab was dry and a little fishy. They don't have a really good dipping sauce for the crab. They have tarter sauce, soy sauce, ketchup,  and cocktail sauce that you can get from the bar at the front. Also fresh garlic & lemon, but there was no utensils for the lemons and garlic to dish it out (probably just an oversight because they just opened). The edamame was okay, but the server said they steam it with the crab to give it flavor, but it tasted like just plain steamed edamame. The dumplings are like the frozen ones from the supermarket- not recommended.  The fried shrimp and calamari were typical bar food and just okay. The small piece of corn on the cob with the snow crab is good as well as the snow crab, but I would like melted butter to dip the crab in. The garlic shrimp and other shell on shrimp are good, but they give you too many if you want to eat other dishes. It was nice that they gave you gloves to eat your crab, wet hand wipes, and bibs. The blue crab is a whole small crab and even though I'm from Hawaii that is something my more adventurous friends would eat, but not me or my friend. They recommend the $55 all you can eat, but in small print they also tack on a 17% service fee.  I had 2 perrier waters for $7.50 & my friend had a $2 ginger ale. We split the bill and ended up paying $74.81 a piece. In my opinion overpriced,  but if you have a huge appetite you may be able to get your money's worth. I felt bad wasting so much food, but I feel the way they tell you to try everything and then order more of what you like is misleading.  If you want to take the leftovers it is an additional $15. In my pics the dumplings are in the dish with the edamame. My friend also had the clam chowder and said she's had better. The clams and mussels were good. They start you off with a garlic panini pressed toast, which is tasty. I also want to apologize to our waiter if our bill did not include tip, but I think the owner cannot tack on a 17% service fee and expect the customer to tip 15-20% more on the meal we received. It was questionable whether it was worth $70+. It definitely was not worthy of $80+ per person!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/crab-house-all-you-can-eat-seafood-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We did noticed something our waitress was doing to everyone on her side. Your first round was fast and she was attentive but then would literally disappear. There was a point where she was gone for 20 minutes and no one knew where she was, and once she came back she even told us to not ask other waiter for service because this was her table. which clearly became impossible since she disappeared so many times. If you order crab legs just know they bring you 2 at a time which is hard when you're a family of 4. So make sure to ask for more or maybe sit close to the kitchen so you can ask for things faster.

We were greeted very friendly - and staff was attentive. I do recommend to get your food in waves as it is an all you can eat so you can enjoy your experience better. Me and a friend ordered most of what we wanted to try in one order and couldn't add more because of how full we were and how big portions were. Overall, It was great, I will be coming back to enjoy my experience the right way instead of one shot- which was my fault. Only thing I can say lacked were corn & potatoes. I didn't see it as a option I could have missed it- but any seafood boil ALWAYS needs corn & potatoes!

They tell you to fill out this paper with all the food items you would like them to bring out. We were there for almost 3 hours and was still waiting for food from the first order . We put in a 2nd paper and it took so long for that food to come out and we was STILL missing a lot of the food that we had checked off. Mind you, they don't bring out enough food in the first place . After we kept complaining they then starting bringing out the food. I asked can we pack up the food at this point because we sat there so long and the kids were beginning to get restless. I was told that they charge $40 to pack up food but he would only charge me $20. I told them I'm not paying to pack up the food at all because we would've been able to eat it there if it would've came out in a timely fashion and if we would've received what we ordered in the first place.

The restaurant is pretty small so the tables are intimately close but everyone is very mindful about keeping the noise level down. Most menu items are on the smaller, tapa like sizes so my friends and I started off with the truffle rice cakes and honey butter tots. The truffle rice cakes reminded me of a pasta dish and was actually very filling and the tator tots were crispy with a subtle hint of honey butter favor.

Very inventive and full of flavor. We came without a reservation and I can't believe it wasn't packed.

If I knew they were smaller portions I would've rather ordered the dishes individually. We also got rushed out after 90 minutes since someone else had reservations but we weren't told there would be a time limit when we sat. The burger was salty yet again.

Nowon is a Korean American Gastro Pub Fusion, the place itself has such a groovy interior and perfect place to have dinner with a friend or to grab some burgers or wings before a night out. The food didn't disappoint either, we ordered the K.F.C (Korean Fried Chicken), Legendary Cheeseburger and Crispy Tater Tots. The K.F.C (Korean Fried Chicken) has a gochujang glaze with blue cheese buttermilk which gives it such a savory and unique taste. The Legendary Cheeseburger has smashed double patties, american cheese, kimchi mayo and b&b pickles, which was a delicious twist on the classic.

Sebastian H.,/user_details?userid=6qZBWG97olYq6HIwIzIj3Q,"Kearny, NJ",8/25/2020,4.0,"3.75 Had this place on the list for a short while due to the IG posts my lady has been sending me. We also pass it every time we are in the East Village. We just decided to go for it. Service is very friendly. I think the selection of classic Hip-Hop (Wu-Tang, DMX, Lox, etc) earns an automatic point! I was loving it. We started with the chopped cheese rice cakes and the wings. The rice cakes, while not reminiscent of chopped cheese (at least to me), were still delicious. The wings were crunchy and pretty tasty, but an order of 6 (really 6 halves) for $20 is very pricey. We also got the chicken sandwich and the burger. The burger was good but not great. My gf and I had split opinions on the chicken sandwich. She though it was ok and I thought it was really good. She wishes they used thigh instead of breast (an opinion I am not at all mad at). I will say the breast was still very juicy and I thought the sandwich had great flavor. The cocktail list is very limited and also a little on the pricey side. The vibe here is cool and it's a place I would love to come back to once indoor dining resumes (hopefully ASAP!). If you are in the East Village I would recommend you stop in for a bite (or two).

We got the octopus and soy chicken wings as appetizers. The octopus was two small skewers and rubbery. I didn't even want to finish my small piece. The wings were small and nothing spectacular. Go to turntable for real wings. We got the dry aged burger and honey butter tater tot's. These took almost 40 mins to arrive after we finished the apps. And then the burger was cold. Probably sat out for 5-10 minutes before someone realized to push out the order. The burger was small and had no flavor and no other condiments other than the spicy mayo. For a $24 burger you expect it to be somewhat good and larger. It does not come with any fries or tots which you order separately. The tots tasted like frozen and the honey butte flavor was a bit overpowering. To summarize there are way better spots to spend your money and to get Korean gastopub experience and food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nowon-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We made a dinner reservation for 5pm on a Sunday, we recommend a reservation since people without reservations were not able to be seated. Got the honey butter tater tots, numbing cucumber salad, spam and octopus fried rice, shin ramyun fried wings, spicy prawn jjampong, and the famed double cheeseburger. All of the food was good. Service was good - offered us to add another wing to the order so that each of us had one, which was the right move, since the wings are so good. The bathroom is a party. One small wish is that the dining room wasn't so dim... But really great music playing, so it was still a lot of fun.

But rounding up for a new restaurant delivering this well. We walked in and were offered a table for an hour. But the hostess moved things around to get rid of the time crunch. Nowon is a very dark spot that feels like they have a DJ playing. But why hide this amazing food? Octopus was perfectly cooked with an interesting flavor. Squeeze the lime. It makes it even better. The cucumbers took a minute, but get the juice from the bottom to really take in the peppercorn. The wings were as advertised - outstanding. And the mung bean pancake was a thicker, juicier scallion pancake. We are definitely quite satisfied.

The honey butter tater tots are the best fried potato type food I've EVER had!! The cream cheese dolloped on the top went really well with the taters and they were subtly sweet. And the Jae Mac is SOO GOOD, which means a lot because I don't even like burgers all that much. Super messy to eat but in terms of taste, 10/10.

As a result, I got to sample a variety of food I probably wouldn't have otherwise. The food here is mostly korean bar food, so don't expect health. I had the pickles, the kimbap, honey butter tater tots, kimchi burrata and the charred broccolini salad. The kimchi burrata was an unexpectedly delicious combination. The honey butter tater tots were tasty but it's hard to mess up deep fried carbs. The kimbap is not worth getting at all. It's fine but not great.

I made a reservation for 5:30pm (NOT a popular time) the morning of (so clearly this was not a reservation that people were trying to make since it was available that morning) and when I was unable to attend my reservation because I was asleep sick in bed and worried I might have COVID, the restaurant charged me $40 ($20 pp). I attempted to cancel the reservation on Resy and it did not give me the option to and said I could not cancel within 24 hrs even though the reservation was made less than 24 hrs before the time of the reservation. I emailed the restaurant to explain the situation and they were very rude and said they were still charging me despite my covid concerns. Most gyms and restaurants are being extremely cautious and understanding of cancellations due to covid but this restaurant was so rude and strictly adhering to their policy despite these unusual times. I would not trust going to this restaurant as it does not seem they are concerned with the risk of covid and would have rather me attend indoor dining even with the risk of having COVID.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nowon-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The chopped cheese rice cakes were delicious, couldn't have been better. The burger was fantastic, I would put it on par with Emily/Emmy Squared. The tots were just normal tater tots drenched, and I mean drenched in butter, avoid at all costs. The cucumber salad starter was devoid of flavor and I wouldn't recommend. Service was fine, atmosphere fine, though there was a table with several children sitting next to us for a 9:30pm reservation on a Friday night.

Amazing food, good service, great small selection of natural wine, good soju bottle options as well as soju cocktails drink selection, cozy ambiance and good price for amazing food. We ordered the guacamole shrimp dip, which was delicious, flavorful and unique. We ordered the chopped cheese rice cakes that were also outstanding, cheesy and so delightfully topped with minced meat and with scallions. We also ordered a side of kimchi which is home made, mild spicy and delicious (had to order an extra side). The fried chicken wings are a must, crunchy skin with a sweet and savory flavor and the juiciest chicken. Simply delicious. The only thing that didn't impress in the menu was the dry aged burger, maybe because it was too much mayo and maybe because the cheese tasted like Kraft cheese...apart from that, everything was beyond delightful and I recommend and I will be back again for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nowon-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I did like the shishito peppers because they were vegan (I think) and the portion was generous. I ordered the hoisin noodles as it was pretty much the only entree available. It's called hoisin Hakka. To the restaurant, hoisin means seafood in Chinese so perhaps an update to the name would make it more clear. The noodles were disappointing. Very hard and I didn't finish them. Despite giving us a two hour dining limit our server was hard to pin down the rest of the evening. It took almost 30 mins to get our dessert and another 20 mins to process our cards. We asked for individual cards if possible and the server said it would take a longer ""minute"". Had we know it would take 20 we would have done one card.

Now dont know what happened! The menu shrunk to one page lost so many good food options and the Bar Manager refuses to make certain drinks at the fully stocked bar. Why? Because we just dont! I havent had a drink in 3 weeks and was talking Macao up to a friend and was looking forward to having a well crafted cocktail here but apparently they ""just dont"" make what I want. No explanation, no reason they just wont. The place was completely empty and its just me and a friend and they refuse to make me one Long Island. They also refuse to make Lychee Martinis. Didnt know since the name is Macao they adopted communist rules as well and decide what you can and cannot drink. Youd think during a pandemic thats forcing all the restaurants in NYC to close up permanently and the fact I was sober and just wanted one drink theyd want to make some money and make me a happy customer.

She could have kept the extra cash for herself but chose to be honest and that really went a long way with our party as they ended up tipping her even more. So many great many items here! My favorite is the Bronzino. The Drunken Dragon's Milk is also a must have! Such a great summer drink - similar to a pina colada but not as sweet.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Absolutely solid and I cannot wait to try other things on the menu. We split an order of dumplings, half steamed and the other half fried. I was not a fan of the fried as it was definitely not what I was used to. It ended up being deep fried and not pan. The steamed were very good. We also got the Lobster noodles and oh my goodness. I'd come downtown just for that dish. I'd eat it every day if I could. It had an entire tail of lobster sitting on top that was grilled and seemingly, the rest of the lobster was in the noodles. Lots of chunks of perfectly cooked lobster through out. The sauce was super spicy and creamy. Cannot say enough about those noodles!

The ambiance is awesome, it's straight out of a movie, awesome old school Asian/Portuguese influence; the food is delicious, service is really good, and the drinks are to die for. There's an upstairs bar which is almost always packed and a small restaurant area. If you go on a Thursday-Saturday evening, they will also have the downstairs open. I love the downstairs, it's dark, lit with a bunch of candles, there are a few small tables and small bar and the bartenders are awesome. My favorite food items: mushroom & truffle croquettes, BBQ pork ribs and shrimp mozambique. All I amazing. I ADORE their Drunken Dragon's Milk drink, and their bashful maiden was really good too  If you tell the bartenders what type of liquor you like and the flavor you are looking for, they will throw something together and it will likely be AMAZING.

Christina G.,/user_details?userid=sNn49OwMPUBhMfozyGz2zw,"New York, NY",1/13/2016,4.0,"I visited Macao for the first time last week and have to say it was one of the best meals I have had recently. The interior of the space is dimly lit and stunning. Apparently it is fashioned to look like the brothels and opium dens of 1930's Macao. That definitely comes through, especially when you take a look at the artwork and scandalous figurines that pepper the stairwell to the downstairs speakeasy. Around 7pm on a Friday night there were plenty of seats available, but after 8pm the place really seemed to pick up. The drink list is great and we really enjoyed our cocktails. The favorite at our table was the Bashful Maiden.  Both the food and drink selection seems to be Asian inspired with an exotic twist. We split a number of appetizers and sides including the charred octopus, which was the best I have ever had. It had great texture and wasn't rubbery the way I have had it at some places. Our favorite thing by far were the mushroom and truffle croquettes. It was very difficult not to order more, they are a must!  Service was attentive and we were happy that they accommodated our walk in, despite there being a lot of reservations coming in. I will definitely visit again and would love to come back to the speakeasy for a sexy date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Moe M.,/user_details?userid=FKBkWE2uY7_-Fo1KEb648g,"Manhattan, NY",2/15/2019,5.0,"We went for Valentines Day and had an 8:30 reservation. Even though most tables were full the hostess graciously gave us a booth at our request. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a smoky dark old world bar in Hong Kong back in the 50s,60s. It is romantic and funky with interesting drinks. I had the Mata Hari a cognac based drink and my Husband had the Bashful Maiden a gin drink. We started with the chicken and pork belly dumplings and the spareribs. Both were delicious and flavorful. We ordered our 2nd round of drinks when Franny our wonderful server informed us that we would have to wait since a health inspector made a surprise visit. They have an A rating which they still have after inspection. They are not allowed to mix cocktails or cook until inspection was completed. We were happy to wait since we were in no rush and it was Valentines Day. After inspection was completed our African Chicken and Veggie Fried rice came out. We split both and the chicken was moist and juicy and I could've eaten the fried rice all day. We ordered the banana split which Franny informed us was on the house cause of the inconvenience!

We were seated at the bar in the basement- The room at first seemed more like a private room/lounge. But as the crowd picked up, it had alot of potential to hang out and meet others. Most of the patrons were mid 20-30s professionals and seemed a somewhat fashionable. The menu was interesting and I don't necessarily mean that in a skeptic manner. Basically, you can choose a dish and have it either Asian or Portuguese style. The dishes were good but not amazing. Based on my tastes, some of them seemed over-seasoned. I'm supposing this is due to their well made cocktails and the intention to drink more and snack lightly.

Taste wise, no complains there. We ordered the steamed chicken/pork dumplings which were great. We also had the mushroom and truffle croquettes and it was out of this world; if I ever come back to this place I would def get two orders of these bad boys, so friggin good! We also had the special fried rice of the night (spicy shrimp fried rice) along with the prawns and the african chicken which was more like a pigeon because it was so small.

The portions were very small - I image they would be bigger for the a la carte menu - but everything was tasty. I definitely could have gone double portion on everything. The ambiance was dim and moody, pretty nice. Servers were very nice overall. I'm knocking off a star for the slow pace and lack of attention in service. It bothers me when a restaurant is only a quarter full but there are five servers clustered in a corner talking with each other and studiously avoiding eye contact with the customers.

Joe V.,/user_details?userid=8ouRrJlPzmQUOW_LKm_e9Q,"Astoria, Queens, NY",8/24/2010,4.0,"Went here last night for a friend's surprise birthday party and it was delightful. As you walk in past the metal doors and observe the dim lighting, dark brick walls, wooden ladders, and the balcony littered with random objects, you will feel like you're dining in a warehouse from the 1940s as opposed to a modern restaurant in Tribeca. The food and decor is supposed to be inspired from the era where Portugal had a colony in China. If the food recipe is accurate, one would conclude that soy sauce was used heavily in that colony. I ordered the Peking Style Pork Ribs with a side of fried rice and nibbled on other dishes of people sitting next to me. The dishes were served with decent portions, tasty, and definitely  unique but I just couldn't ignore the heavy use of soy sauce. For dessert, I had the Coconut Panna Cotta and the Portuguese doughnuts with rum sauce. Both great but everyone in our table attacked the Portuguese doughnuts. Since the place is not very large, they were able to provide attentive service to all the tables. I was informed that they also have a lounge in the basement but I did not get a chance to check it out.

L S.,/user_details?userid=KHZsBBgcMCnXPI2w_bMp2A,"Atlanta, GA",5/1/2013,2.0,"There are things that were great about this place and things that were really not. The atmosphere is cool, the bartender is spectacular but the food was below average. I started at the bar with a Malena and it was a very awesome drink. Bourbon, Campari and some other wacky ingredients but it definitely hit the spot. One gripe I have is that my date was a little late so I told the bartender we had a 6:00 reservation and wondered if I should let the Hostess know.. The place was empty at the time but I just didn't want them to think I was a no show. He said ""no problem' Well I checked my Open Table account today and they marked me as a no show...ding them a 1/2 star. When we did sit down our waitress was pleasant enough if a bit scattered. We ordered a bottle of the Pinot Blanc Blend from Alsace and she said they were out of it. Then she ends up bringing a bottle any way. As far as the food goes, any average place in Chinatown is better with PF Changs blowing it away. We started with the steamed dumplings which were good but the pork inside was a bit crunchy? We also ordered the calamari with olives and white beans. This plate was basically 1 long tentacle that was deep fried and a few beans on the plate...meh. For an entree we decided to split the chicken and the bacon and shrimp fried rice. The chicken was really dry. I thought it would be a classic Chinese chicken dish with cubes of chicken in sauce but it was basically a quarter of a chicken with some heavily seasoned skin sitting on a plate. You definitely had to drown the thing in peanut sauce in order to swallow it. The highlight of the meal was definitely the fried rice. It was served with a fried egg on top and once you mix that in the flavors were delish. Would I go back? Not for the food, maybe for the drinks and the place does get rockin after 7:00 pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Krystian D.,/user_details?userid=Qq5k4KYtRA_Nnc5JgfpBiA,"New York, NY",4/3/2010,1.0,"The place was a disaster from the moment we entered the door. The hostess only mentioned there was a downstairs lounge with possible seating after we'd been standing in stilettos for nearly 30 minutes. We were given a table for six (although there were only two of us) and told we had an hour before they needed the table for a large party. Then, before we could order, we were asked to move to a smaller table because a large party had just arrived and they needed the table (we were compensated with a round of drinks). Mind you, we were told that the two seater was on reserve and we could not be seated there not five minutes before. Ok, despite this, we order and have a lovely (yet slow) meal. The Portuguese style chicken was amazing and the Chinese broccoli is delicious. I must say overall the quality of service and ambiance are nonexistent. Macao was understaffed and poorly managed. In fact, Brian, the manager last night, was the worse part of my experience. We asked our server to split the check and she paid the wrong amounts to each card. Brian, took over from there and says ""Well, we don't split checks. You've got one table, you get so one check. So tell me how much you want to put on each card."" Needless to say, this is highly inappropriate, demonstrates absence of class and professionalism. And then he pretended he could not assign appropriate sales tax to a $44 subtotal and asked us to do the math for tax as well. He never apologize for the mistake made to our bill and only apologized for his behaviour after I pointed out that it was disrepectful and just plain wrong. Neema, our server is an absolute doll and, even though she made an error in settling our bill, was totally gracious and is an asset to the establishment. Overall, I will never return because the good food and great dessert and far outweighed by disorganization and bad leadership.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Lolin L.,/user_details?userid=zJp6um8sxHAfB6Fbih86CQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/18/2023,5.0,"I love cream puffs, so naturally when I saw a new cream puff spot opened I had to try. The space is cute, a decent size and there are a few tables inside for you to sit down and enjoy your pastries and puffs at. I tried the banana chocolate, tiramisu, black sesame, and ube. I'm a big fan of chocolate and banana so it's no surprise that my favorite was the chocolate banana flavor. The ube one had a very subtle ube flavor, the black sesame and tiramisu fillings were equally as good. The cream puffs are small enough so you can buy a few more to try and not be too full. Priced decently. Loved the texture of their crust. They're best enjoyed as soon as you purchase them so the crust won't get soggy I would think.

The interior is really brightly decorated and there's a few tables, although they were all full when I came around 4 PM on a Saturday. There were a decent number of people inside, and some of the flavors were sold out. We got the black sesame and seasonal strawberry Sakura cream puffs, and they were both really good. I was surprised because only the cream on top of the puff is flavored, and the filling inside is just vanilla, but the flavors still came through. I especially loved the black sesame, since the flavor was really rich and strong. The strawberry one was solid, but I couldn't really taste the Sakura. They're pretty small and a little expensive for the price, considering you can get larger ones for only one or two more dollars at Alimama or Bibble and Sip, but I still really enjoyed them.

I recently had the pleasure of visiting this cozy little bar, and let me tell you, their crème brûlée Mac n cheese is nothing short of magical. It's like someone took the best parts of a campfire and turned it into a delicious meal. And don't even get me started on the s'mores dessert - it's absolutely to-die-for.

Alissa M.,/user_details?userid=d3UqedJrFyFr3u9kPu_QPg,"Brooklyn, NY",2/16/2023,2.0,"My friends and I came here one night around 8:30pm on a weekday and we were able to be seated right away. The decor is unique, with a tree in the middle of the dining area and ""cabin"" inspired art. The dining area was dark and the music was loud. Upon seeing the menu, we realized that the dishes were meant to be shared. We ordered a few dishes for the table (mac and cheese brûlée, crispy brussels, glazed bacon steak, truffle fries, and meatballs). I forgot to take pictures of the fries and the meatballs, but the fries were doused in truffle mayo which was a bit overpowering, and the meatballs were bland. Seriously, as I was eating them I was thinking about how my mom makes better meatballs. The mac and cheese brûlée was also underwhelming and very watery. It did not hit the spot we were looking for with cheesy goodness (how do you mess up mac and cheese?) The bacon steak was... weird. We thought it would be bacon wrapped steak, but our waitress did tell us that it was just a steak of actual bacon. We decided to still order it anyway and regretted it. Although the flavor wasn't bad, the texture was just weird and it was fatty and chewy. The crispy brussels were the only thing we ordered that we were happy with. They had an addicting sweet and savory flavor. Overall, we were disappointed with our meal and experience. Especially for the price, we expected better. We didn't try the drinks so maybe those are worth it, but I don't think I can recommend this restaurant when there are so many more better options in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Shannon D.,/user_details?userid=7aNHVbQzDMomCuKOrLyElA,"New York, NY",2/7/2023,4.0,"While working our way downtown to go bowling, my fiancé and I were planning to find a spot for dinner on our route and this led us to find the Cabin. First of all the decor is super cool. A tree in the middle of the main dining room with seasonal trimmings and a very cozy feel. The staff were so accommodating despite our lack of reservation and got us a spot at the corner of the bar. We started out with some drinks which were both so delicious and creative. We ordered based almost entirely off the waiters suggestions, and he was pretty spot on. We shared the Brussels sprouts. And I cannot make this more clear. They may have been the best thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. I want to try and remake them, but I cannot imagine it getting any better. I then had the brûlée Mac and cheese which was also so delicious. That something extra added by the brûlée was fantastic. My fiancé had the meatballs, which he also said were so yummy, but unfortunately cold which is the only reason this spot did not receive 5 stars from me. I think if we ever went back if would be for a drink and the Brussels sprouts as a precursor to another dinner. All in all, such a fantastic spontaneous dinner experience!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Unfortunately the food was quite lackluster. I had the pac's potatoes and eggs. The texture of the eggs was strange, like very overcooked. And despite mention of bell peppers, they were nowhere to be seen. The potatoes on their own were greasy. The burger was good but the fries it came with were undercooked.

The drinks are crafted for pictures and taste. I came with a large group of friends and were seated in the front with a bench that was a Windowsill which was perfect for the weather. We ordered almost everything on the food menu because everything was appetizer size. Brussel sprouts were 10/10 and must try, even if you think you don't like Brussel sprouts, you will after trying there's (trust me, my friend hates them and loved it after one bite). The fried chicken is nice and crispy which was unexpected at a place like this. The veggie burger actually tasted like real meat (my vegetarian friends were pleasantly surprised) and the meatballs were seasoned to perfected and plated so perfectly. The s'mores was not particularly my favorite as it literally was Graham crumble, cold chocolate and marshmallow but I enjoyed the fire display. Lastly but most importantly, the service was AMAZING. The waitress, the hostess, the busboy and everyone in between came to our table multiple times and made sure we were good each and every time.

Jessica A.,/user_details?userid=0Xyf3EYsrpfGkzvrZoRHuw,"Manhattan, NY",3/15/2023,1.0,I went to this place for ladies brunch in the spring time. My experience then was very nice. So for my daughter's 19 bday I decided to take her here for dinner along with her boyfriend and my 17 year old daughter. I made reservations online and indicated the reason for our dinner was my daughter's bday which I was so excited for her to try their food and feel special that day. The time was set for 7pm which by then was dark out. We arrived the hostess took us to our table and was very nice. We got our menus and ordered our food. As soon as our order was placed the manager approached me in front of my kids and other clients that were sitting very close to us to. He said for future reference we don't book for mom's and their teenagers because we've had bad experiences before where the mom and their teenagers cause chaos in here. I said we're not those type of ppl and I've already placed the order. He said it's ok your food is already here. Our food came out from the kitchen within 5 minutes of ordering it. I honestly wanted to leave in that moment but I didn't want to ruin my daughter's night. We were sat at 7pm we received our check at 7:30pm this including a small dessert I ordered for my daughter with a candle. The reason why I'm writing this review now is because someone recently asked me about this place since I had been there twice. I realized reviews are important. If this happens to someone else they will understand the racial profiling the manager of this restaurant did to us. I'll never again go here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Brady R.,/user_details?userid=p0ZUYI7IOF3ltVzsxsnSmA,"Milford, CT",1/8/2022,3.0,"There is a lot to like about the Cabin but there were a few things that were off putting about the place. We had a party of 6 & decided to come here for a birthday in the group because the vibe looked awesome from the pictures on Yelp. I can confirm that it passes the vibe check. It feels like you are eating dinner in the middle of the woods. Unfortunately that's not necessarily a good thing because it was cold outside and they only were using one door to let guests in. Therefore a massive draft swept the restaurant anytime came or left. Besides it being freezing, the decor and the fact a tree was in the middle of the restaurant was pretty awesome. Typically I like to drink just beer or wine when I'm out to eat but decided to go with the camp fire old fashioned to start. I like old fashions but this was elevated with a dash of maple syrup. For food, this place has a lot of shareable plates. We ordered the creme brûlée Mac 'N' Cheese, truffle fries, burrata & crispy Brussels Sprouts. The Mac, Brussels and fries are must have when coming here. To add a crystallized brûlée on top of a Mac n cheese seems like a strange concept but it was actually pretty bomb. The brussels were sweet & savory which made them tasty...they were so good we ordered another plate! I'd avoid the Burrata, it's not worth your hard earned cash. It wasn't terrible but it was nothing special either.  For our main courses we all ordered our own dishes. I might have to give up ordering meatballs and comparing them to my moms because 1) I'm getting sick of meatballs 2) Places have meatballs on their menus that really have no business being in the meatball game. This one was disastrous really for one reason: they were stone cold. I usually never send food back, I take a more passive aggressive approach, Yelp. But this time it couldn't be ignored and had to be sent back so we could get some warm ones. Even the second ones that came out weren't hot, they were just warm entering into that lukewarm temp pretty quickly. The balls themselves weren't terrible. I liked the creativity of the bison being the meat in the ball. The sauce was so so...nothing that popped & pretty forgettable. Prior to coming here we saw pictures of the smores and it looked different than what we were served. They still torched it which is always fun to watch but the dish definitely looked different than what we were expecting. What makes a s'more so good? The perfect ratio of chocolate, graham and marshmallow. Well there was no graham in sight so it was missing that s'mores essence. I didn't particularly care for this dish...wish I ordered the deconstructed apple pie...oh well. Overall, this spot has a lot going for them and honestly if they can fix the temperature situation as well as tweaks to some of their dishes, this could have been a 5 star.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Often when a place has such a unique ambiance, either service or quality of food is lacking. However, the Cabin delivered on both. While the music was too loud (you could barely hear each other) and three courses were done in 45 minutes (way too stressful), the experience was still pleasant. The ambiance was nice, the service terrific and the food good. We will try to come back during the week to see if it feels as rushed as well.

It went from bison meatballs to fried chicken to ravioli. We unfortunately got all three for the table and the meatballs were bland and grainy while the chicken was ok however the portion was so small it could barely be considered an appetizer.

I made a reservation for 5 at 1pm. When we got there, they took the menus and, without informing or asking us as a courtesy, if we'd like to be sorted indoor or outdoor, they took us out back to their makeshift cabin/camping like tent (keeping up with the theme) except, it was awful. The tent felt like it would blow over and fall on top of us. They had heat lamps, which honestly seemed useless; why? Because the 2 tents they set up, had a HUGE opening at the top.. because the tents were not set end to end, instead it left a wide opening. The rain and snow fell on our heads. We were cold and honestly the staff just was not pleasant. We wanted to enjoy our brunch, instead we felt rushed and left with headaches, cold feet, and runny noses. 3 of the 5 of us had a fever by the time we got home. There was no other reason for us to be upset if we were just asked the option or if the outside seating was more properly set up.

When half of the party arrived (early) they wanted to k ow what we wanted to eat!  We told them we would like some coffee. One guest only takes decaf. Nope they don't have it. Only some decaf tea. No hot chocolate for two kids either. They advertise as a brunch place?   When all guest arrived (at the assigned time). We tried to get more coffee. Told they are brewing fresh pot. No one else was in the restaurant and they ran out of coffee already!  We ordered food and for two kids we asked for eggs,bacon, cheese on a roll. Told they couldn't do it!  We explained that they had eggs and cheese and bacon and hamburger buns on the menus. We were told they could give us a biscuit, order the eggs cheese and bacon and PUT IT TOGETHER OURSELVES!   Still waiting for coffee!  Finally got a few more cups. At exactly 60 minutes on the clock they wanted to know if we wanted anything else. Luckily I forgot to bring  the birthday cakes that they wanted to charge a cake fee.  We just wanted to get out. Unfortunately the food was good but the place has no idea how to run a brunch. Completely non-accommodating and horrible systems.  I would pass!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We booked this place for a bachelorette party because they said they could accommodate 13 people. We arrived, and they led us to an outdoor area that looked like somebody's backyard had just been hit by a tornado. It was dirty, freezing cold, and they gave us 2 separate picnic tables. We wanted to leave, but they would charge a fee per person. They ended up moving us inside, but there was still no room to sit together. A few of us (including the bride) ended up having to sit at the bar. The food was awful, the most basic things you could make at home and grossly overpriced.

The place is beautifully decorated inside with artificial flower vines. I was immediately seated even though I was waiting on my friends which I really appreciate. We started with mimosa and other cocktails and were wowed. They were not too strong but definitely gave the buzz we needed without getting drunk. The food however was underwhelming. We ordered lobster sandwich which was too dry and french toast which was too sweet. Breakfast scrambler had cheese lumps in it and was too bland. The salad it came with had no dressing just some salt sprinkled on it. Not sure if it was just the brunch food which was disappointing but not sure we'll be coming back to give it another try.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Belle L.,/user_details?userid=Xvu477gZ296XpAUCxZIBUA,"New York, NY",12/11/2019,5.0,"Made a last minute reservation at this place for a quick dinner. Came here roughly around 5 PM and it was pretty empty with the exception of 1 table. We ordered 2 hot toddies which we felt like there was no alcohol in it at all. Even so it tasted great and we didn't mind. We got 3 dishes to share- a brussel sprouts dish, a salmon dish and another dish which I don't remember. Regardless everything tasted amazing and was so flavorful. The service was also attentive and everyone there seemed to be enjoying the food. When we left it started to get packed pretty quickly. Will definitely come here again for the food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Kristen G.,/user_details?userid=ZQKrOHZSAW_DM-oS_kTXhg,"Hoboken, NJ",9/2/2019,5.0,"Surprised this place is delicious!! Wow. The decor is for a young crowd. Tried this via the Fever app. We each got three drinks and one brunch dish. We tried the bloody Mary's and I got a mimosa. The drinks were delicious! The Bloody Mary has some nice heat. The mimosa was good too. We ordered the egg white omelette and the biscuits and gravy. Everything came out hot! And quick. Service was great. Our waitress, Payton, was very attentive. Everything was delicious! The eggs were fluffy, the cheese was melted and the scallions were fresh. The arugula on both dishes were lightly dressed, fresh, and yummy! The biscuits were cooked perfectly! Soft and warm on the inside and a little crunch on the outside. The gravy is thick but has incredible flavor. Everything paired so well. Very happy with this place! And for NY the prices are amazing. We will be back. :) Definitely recommend giving this place a try!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My only downside to this restaurant is that the portions are SO small that you end up spending a fortune. It would be a good place for like 2/3 people since it is so small BUT for 5 very hungry people we had to order a lot of food. The truffle fries were amazing and the drinks were good too.

The spiked hot cider was good but that's where the good ends. We were sat outside and they assured us there would be heat lamps but when we sat they were turned off to ""air out the tent."" Over the next hour we asked about 6 times if the heaters could be turned back on yet and were repeatedly told no even though it was 45 degrees out. We were originally told we had to order one food item and then after we did we were told actually it's 2. Which is fine it just should have been clear from the get go. The meatballs were subpar to say the best. The s'mores were cold and burnt. Not a great combo.

Elizabeth L.,/user_details?userid=SDNkFDSc7aR8id2PT-LW3g,"Norfolk, VA",9/18/2020,4.0,I was very pleased with the drinks and with the food however I was disappointed in our reservation. We made a reservation and I assumed the back porch area which has a very pretty white tent with white lights would be for reservations and the front area with blue tents would be for walk ins. They made no effort with the front. It's very dark. No lights at all whereas the back is very well lit. I asked the hostess and she said a walk in and of 8 guests came in before us and took over much of the back tent. I would normally give this management strategy a 3 out of 5 stars but it's covid and the employees were lovely. Just think reservations vs walk ins should be handled differently.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

One thing to know about going to this bar was that they didn't have too many options of food in the dinner menu. Also the thing that bothered me was that I really came here for the drinks. But they were being cheap with the alcohol, and they put a giant ice cube  in the small cups! I was hoping they would give us more especially for a $15 drink.  I ordered 21 Questions and Alaskan Salmon fillet. The food was decent but I wasn't too crazy about it. And in the dessert menu is an absolute joke. The s'more is literally a small cube of chocolate with a creamy marshmallow on top, sprinkled with the grand crackers, they used a flame torch to heat it up.  Lastly my friends got the deconstructed apple pie with ice cream..... all we were eating was just tiny bits of everything.  Would not recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The minute I sat down our server came by to inform me that happy hour ends in an hour in case we wanted to get some happy hour prices. I got the mulled wine and the spicy margarita. Both were very strong lol. I've never had a spicy margarita the way it is done here. I ordered the fries and chicken. Both were delicious!

Maria M.,/user_details?userid=aUxj0qB9C7LMebZWEq_j0A,"Jersey City, NJ",4/11/2021,2.0,"I will start by saying that atmosphere and décor is beautiful. My party was seated outdoor under a tent, it very covid safe while still maintaining the vibe. Our waitress was friendly, very descriptive and took the time to ensure that we were taken care of. Unfortunately, after we placed our order for dinner everything else went downhill. The burger was the best thing we had, the meatballs were average and the not Caesar salad was nothing to write home about, not to mention we were charged a dollar for a side of Aioli. Drinks were decent for NYC, however they were served in plastic cups ( I guess this is because of covid). When it came time to order dessert around 8pm, they ran out of their smores dessert. I don't understand how you run out of one, out of two desserts on your entire menu so early on during a Saturday Night service ( especially after your staff was raving about the homemade marshmallow). Additionally, we were charged a cake cutting fee, which is normal, but my issue came when the waiter dropped cake all over the table and practically butchered the cake. Once our bill was paid, we were practically kicked out. I understand that with covid restrictions, it is important to keep to the time limit, but as we walked out, we overheard the staff saying that "" we were doing this on purpose, that we were being rude."" I truly hate to write this because this is the time were we need to support this industry, but all this experience did was create a bitter taste.

Meatballs lacked flavor, lobster roll had a measly amount of shredded lobster, truffle fries were soggy, watermelon cucumber salad was so soggy. And finally, the fried chicken!!! It was so burnt and flavorless, I can't believe they had the nerve to serve that to anyone. Drinks are also SO expensive. A vodka soda with their cheapest liquor will run you $16, which is the same price of their specialty cocktails.

Vane K.,/user_details?userid=tW8rXQYkekQndaNdQbc5Qg,"Ossining, NY",2/25/2020,5.0,"I came here with my husband to meet a few friends. We had made reservations for 5:00 PM, however, we arrived at 4:30 PM. We were greeted right away and informed that the kitchen is closed until 5PM, but are more than welcomed to have a seat at the bar. The host was super nice she even asked people to scoot over so that we could sit comfortably, she even brought me a high chair. So sweet of her, she really went the extra mile. While seated at the bar, we met trey or drake (one of the owners of this restaurant) had a couple of drinks so didn't pick up the name correctly, I apologize about that. He was actually our bartender and I thought it was pretty cool that he was working hard like all the other employees, WAY TO SET AN EXAMPLE! He was telling us that he appreciates our visit, which was a nice touch. Once our friends arrived, we were seated at a table, where we were seated was a bit tight, the staff had no problem relocating us to a new table setup which was much more comfortable. The menu does not have a lot of options, however the flavors make up for it! We basically ordered everything off the menu. I wanted dessert first, so I had S'Mores first! It was amazing, they lit it on fire in front of you and brought a bunch of spoons so that we all could share. The waitress we had was so kind and always replenishing our water and checking on us. We had the Crispy Brussels Sprouts, French Fries (both Truffle and regular), the Fried Chicken with Coleslaw, the Salmon, as a second dessert the Apple Pie. On top of all that a bunch load of Mojitos and Spicy Margaritas. The vibe of this place was awesome, I loved the mix of music. There was a live DJ before Dinner started which was cool.

Matthew N.,/user_details?userid=PQaSZJRmnYJAm0ccZKYsiw,"Queens, NY",10/23/2021,1.0,"Food was good. But the service was bad to the point that you won't care. Called up at 10:15pm on a Saturday night asking when they were open until, and was told the bar is open until 1am and the kitchen is open until 12am. We arrived around 10:45pm and got food and drinks. Everything was good.  Suddenly at 11:20pm when we are about half done with our meal, the manager rushes over like he's clearing the stage at a night club and says we have to finish up and get the bill. His explanation was that there was a ""private event"" currently going on in the back, and some other gibberish about how we had to leave before them. When I explained to him what I was told on the phone, he said that is true but not on nights when they have private events, and that ""he did us a favor"" by even serving us at the time we walked in. After we paid the bill he came over (clearly seeing how annoyed we were at his dismissiveness) and said that it was the hostess's fault because she was ""new here"". Very rich of the manager to just blame his staff and show absolutely zero care or consideration for the customer. But wait, it gets even worse. I told him that this was no way to treat customers, and that at least he could have done something for us to make us feel valued, like taking something off the bill or giving us a free round, etc. His response was ""well you got served didn't you! You ate the food"". Probably one of the worst service  experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. I know it is COVID and mediocre service is now becoming the new ""normal"". But there is never any excuse for essentially telling your customers to their faces that their concerns are irrelevant and that they are not valued.

Bryant V.,/user_details?userid=AgQAgVNDpGnIuyh2HGCMmw,"Queens, NY",10/26/2021,5.0,"A great place for date night.  We reserved our table for a Saturday night and we were seated right away. The space is super welcoming and dope. The decor is really cool, combing the wood elements and cozy accents with modern art. There's even a very instagram worthy swing by the bathroom to take really cool pictures snd videos with. The bear and cat paintings based on Biggie and Tupac's iconic hip-hop images are great touches especially since they have an amazing old school hiphop/r&b playlist playing at a decent volume in the background. The drinks were amazing, my girlfriend loved the sweet flower which is infused with chamomile syrup and I stuck to 21 questions. The food was also amazing. It's tapas style and the menu encourages sharing, which my girlfriend and I usually like to do in order to be able to try everything. However, next time we agreed we will be getting our own fried chicken because we wanted more! We also loved the Brussels  sprouts and the truffles fries. The meatballs in sauce was very tasty and the added bread was great to drench it in the sauce. We also order the bacon dates and bacon steak. Overall the food and drinks were delicious and we will definitely be returning.

The space is cool and the music playing gives the place a great vibe. With all that said Id read about the dinner menu being small portions meant for sharing but brunch was individual dishes.

Audrey T.,/user_details?userid=eYEZq-SeASGAsZ09GURYBw,"Jersey City, NJ",11/23/2019,4.0,"A very festive cocktail bar/restaurant in Alphabet City that is ideal for the Fall and leading up to the holidays. They are very true to their theme- there is a tree in the middle of the bar, lots of cute bear decor, and fake mossy grass on the walls. We came on a Sunday afternoon for drinks, and it was pretty crowded and there was a DJ playing some great throwback hits. The biggest downsides were that the by glass wine list was quite short- no Sauvignon Blanc, and each cocktail was $15/$16, which is actually expensive for Alphabet city. We tried the S'mores and apple pie for dessert. Both were great- the S'mores had a chocolate ganache and home made marshmallow cream, and the pie had a nice flaky crust and sweet filling.

Made a reservation for 7:45 and showed up around 7:40. I believe it was the owner who checked us in and asked us to take a seat at the bar while we waited. We were never moved to a table. Another couple arrived at the same time with a reservation and they were never seated after waiting for 30 minutes and decided to leave-telling the owner they were disappointed with their experience. We got drinks- and upon seeing how busy it was and how the service was clearly lacking- we paid out and decided to leave. The bartenders were clearly very busy and rushed, the owner/manager kept yelling at them, and we were in the splash zone when we were sitting at the bar. As we were about to leave- the shift changed, the crowed cleared a bit, Rick became our new bartender, and our experience immediately changed. He gave us waters and new drinks and we were finally able to get food. We ordered the sliders, truffle fries, fried chicken, peach pie, and s'mores. The desserts were top notch!!!

I actually bought a voucher from gilt city for dinner and drinks. The restaurant is very cute and homey. It is small and it has this pretty tree lit with lights in the middle of the restaurant. We made a reservation and we were running late due to traffic and the weather. They were really accommodating and didn't give us a hard time about being late. The menu is meant to be shared. The dishes are organized by vegetables, fish and meat then dessert. Everything we ordered was a sharable plate rather than an entree. We started with the truffle fries. They were great for fries however I didn't taste much truffle. We had the shrimp scampi. It came with three jumbo shrimp. The shrimp were very fresh. We had crab cakes that were really delicious. We also had the jammed up sliders which were a little larger than a typical slider size but delicious. They had a great bacon jam sauce that had a little kick to it. We shared the fried chicken which had great flavor and seasoning. They brought out the chicken with a two minute sand timer and suggested we eat the chicken when the timer runs out to keep the chicken moist. For dessert, we had the bread pudding which was also great. Overall, The Cabin had great food, drinks and service.

Sofia R.,/user_details?userid=F24wZ3QBHVfJ06lblL1IAg,"New York, NY",8/10/2019,5.0,There's no better place in EV for brunch or drinks anytime than the Cabin. This place is so adorable and So insta-worthy. First dates - go here. Impress a girl - go here. Jam to 80s90s on a Sunday afternoon - go here. Happy hours go until 8 4 nights a week. The owner Joey is a kid from the neighborhood who came back to open a place in his old stomping grounds. He's generous and kind and will make sure you have a great meal. For $10 on Sundays u get three drinks (mimosas - screwdrivers Or bloodys) w ur brunch for $10. Crazy!

Frank T.,/user_details?userid=-s2AOLG-pSJ4bBz0lZPYYA,"Manhattan, NY",4/18/2019,5.0,"Went to the cabin tonight for dinner and drinks with a few friends. When you walk in you can see that the owners took a lot of time to make sure every detail was perfect. There's a big tree in the middle of the restaurant that really makes you feel like you are in a cabin in the woods somewhere. The music was acoustic laid back songs that really set the cabin House mood. We all ordered drinks off the cocktail menu. Our favorites were the spicy margarita and the old fashion. When it came to food we couldn't have been more impressed. The portions were generous and they even served the food with an hourglass (and told us to wait until it ran out so that the food would be perfect to eat) LOVED the attention to detail. I can say that the whole menu was filled with awesome comfort food (I got the fried chicken with spicy honey dipping sauce - incredible) The chicken was crisp and you could tell it was fresh. My friends had the house meatball and the glazed bacon. We ate so much that we had no room for dessert, but the manager (dont remember his name but couldn't have been nicer) came over and asked if it was our first time. When we said yes he asked that we sit tight and came back with a homemade chocolate and marshmallow smore. Ohhhhhhhhh man it was ridiculous. It's a must try, trust me. Really happy we stumbled on this place walking around our neighborhood and we plan on going back this weekend for brunch. The manager said that they do live acoustic music on the weekends, which I'm sure is gonna be a really nice touch. Well done cabin crew, can't wait to come back and try the rest of your menu.  Cheers!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

If you're here with a group, don't bother with the food. We were a group of three and were so SHOCKED with how tiny the portions were, that we just called it quits after the Brussels and truffle fries. Both were tasty, but 100% not worth the price.

The decor is awesome and the throwback brunch had great music and a good menu selection. However everything else left something to be desired. First off, there was 1 server for the entire place so she was flustered and not very friendly. She seemed annoyed when we asked for anything. We tried to be helpful and order our drinks and food at 1 time to make life easier for her. My husband doesn't eat gluten or carbs so he asked for no bun with the burger and she hesitantly said okay and he asked if it was possible to substitute the fries for something else and her exact words were ""you're already asking for a lot and the kitchen is small so no"", he said okay and left it at that. Later when the drinks came, the Diet Coke was flat and we very nicely let her know and asked for a coffee instead she just took everything from the table without saying a word then plopped the coffee down. The burger did indeed come out with a bun but we didn't even bother to say anything and Everyones burgers were well under done (everyone asked for medium or medium well and they all came out medium rare) only 1 person asked for the burger to be cooked more, everyone else just dealt with it. I ordered the eggs and potatoes and they were cold when they arrived but I figured at that point the server would have chopped my head off so I just ate them.

A large party was seated next to my friend and I, but they were polite and we were more than happy to squish in for them. The waitress had been nice enough to combine two tiny tables so all our plates could fit without sliding off, but within 10 minutes of our entrees arriving, the manager (I assume) interrupted us to tell us we had to move because he needed the table. He was very pushy with no apology for the inconvenience of moving our meal onto a table that couldn't accommodate it. He started taking plates to make everything fit and things got uncomfortable quickly. Once we were resettled, I asked if our drinks could be taken off the bill. The manager (?) was immediately irate and insisted that they didn't do that. He tried to push complimentary shots, which I declined. He returned again to push the shots, which I declined again. He repeatedly put his hand on my shoulder, insisting that I take a drink, finally offering champagne. I wanted to try and salvage what had initially been a nice brunch, so I agreed. In the end, the difference between the champagne and the drinks I asked him to comp was $9. He ended the experience by dropping off the check and informing us that there was a reservation waiting for our table, but ""no rush.""

Angelica Q.,/user_details?userid=3ZWT0H_CTjIb4WiAYEG0fA,"New York, NY",3/8/2019,5.0,"If I could give this place six stars I would! The cabin has three primary beauties, the ambience,the  delicious cuisine, and of course the stellar staff. First,let's start with the design. The restaurant achieves the look of a cozy, warm cabin, which gives you a break from the rough and grimy city outside it's doors. It is anything but basic, and I would definitely recommend going here if you need a change of scenery from your regular bar and dining atmosphere. Second, and probably most important, the cuisine. These portions are great to share, but while you can just eat them on your own- I think it makes for a much more fun experience if you gather a couple friends, order everything on the menu, and share the food. My personal recommendations are the Brussel sprouts (oh my god, I dream of it), The chili, and last but not least- the truffle fries. I've never had better truffle fries my entire life, they were so plump and soft on the inside and had a golden crunch on the outside- topped with the perfect amount of toppings. Don't skip out on the dessert either. Share a s'mores with friends- it's an interesting take and a unique experience. The staff are very kind and accommodating too. I will be returning to the cabin very soon =)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cabin-nyc-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Mark B.,/user_details?userid=cbxJaFxdB-GEbTrBCMDkmA,"Houston, TX",3/29/2020,2.0,"I ordered delivery from Roberta's, and unfortunately, I was highly disappointed. My greatest point of contention was the size of the pie, which is only 12 inches. To charge approximately $20 for a 12 inch pie is quite excessive, I think. Second of all, their crust. I've had a number of pies in the Bedstuy, Bushwick, Queens, and lower Manhattan areas, and so I am confident in my abilities to distinguish between a well-cooked crust and a burnt crust. This crust was definitely burnt in many parts of the pie. Yet somehow, the pie had an extreme amount of flop. Confused on that one. The delivery was on time, so I cannot take any points away from them on that one. The ingredients were also pretty good, albeit not as plentiful as they should have been. I am giving them a 2-star review due to the size of the pie in relation to the cost, the poorly-cooked crust, and under-serving the toppings.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/robertas-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Cecilia C.,/user_details?userid=W80BuAjANlrmkW8jenJtCg,"Cherry Hill, NJ",6/23/2021,4.0,"Had to try the pizza here even though so far out of Manhattan because I have been hearing about it being the best for so long. We went for lunch on a Wednesday and made a reservation although unnecessary, there were several empty tables. The outside of the restaurant is pretty raw, it doesn't seem like a restaurant I would go into if I was just walking by, but that's part of the vibe being in Bushwick. Their outdoor seating was very cute, with a garden with picnic tables and bar with a very specific 70s hippies vibe. The pizza was very good, it had a perfect Neapolitan crust and the offerings for the toppings were both original and authentic and fresh for the classics. We tried a margherita and a cheesus christ adding speck. They were both delicious although very expensive, especially for being in Bushwick near not much else. That would be my criticism, especially since adding the speck was $5 and you can see from the picture attached how much was put on it. The service was pretty good as the servers were all extremely friendly even though one pizza came out about 5 minutes after the other. Overall, I think it was a good experience to try it out but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back considering you can find similar pizzas in Manhattan for the same price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/robertas-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They also sell pizza making kits which are fun but it's wayyy better when they make it in their oven!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/robertas-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Gentjana H.,/user_details?userid=1sS1tKxUA4cP6jeoF8l17g,"Brooklyn, NY",2/19/2021,5.0,Take out and dining in the car!! Lol but either way the pizza was good. We got the Bee sting and Speckenwolf. Both were good but just be aware that Speckenwolf has a lotttt of onions and if you DO NOT eat onions (like myself) then opt out from this choice unless you just want to try it and pick the onions out (that's what I did ‍). I think Bee sting does taste better.. it's a combination of honey and a little spicy. A must try!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/robertas-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ellie S.,/user_details?userid=f6_S2BYuJXDbzqRYyMNYgg,"Queens, Queens, NY",1/5/2020,5.0,One of the best pizzeria in Brooklyn. The crust is thin if that's what you like. They make the pizza in the front and it's baked in the oven. The pie is a perfect size (not too big or small) to share with someone or eat on your own. The atmosphere and interior is cozy.

Bre Y.,/user_details?userid=A-ed1j8lfnUpdlglwmfUnQ,"Brooklyn, NY",9/23/2020,5.0,"It's so popular for a reason. Roberta's offers tasty wood fired pies in a hip setting. They do offer a nice amount of outdoor space, that in the summer is a fun spot for events (the frozen margaritas are key).  They also have a take out shop next door, where you can get a pizza to go and stake out some of the outdoor seating (reserved for this purpose) to avoid any ridiculous wait times for table service.  Inside, I enjoy sitting in the Atrium. I recommend the Bee Sting Pizza (chili and honey featured) and the Speckenwolf (white pie with speck). I will say that it is always packed, and often touristy as well. As someone who has lived in the neighborhood for years, I find myself only going when an out of town friend wants to check it out.

Fernando M.,/user_details?userid=-CS2VWhKM5zOiBxWk-8Vqg,"Brooklyn, NY",11/19/2021,1.0,"I don't understand the hype around Roberta's. I tried dining there two times and both were disappointing experiences. My first experience with Roberta's started when I was doing a Pizza Crawl through Brooklyn. We hit six spots that day and Roberta's was last on our list. We wanted to end it with a bang. But I must admit Roberta's was the worst experience of the day. To start off, we put our names down for a table inside so we could have their so called full service restaurant experience. After an hour of waiting, they text us saying they were no longer seating tables inside as they had reached full capacity, they then recommended that we get a pie at their take out window, which was absolutely packed. After another 40 minutes of impatiently waiting, we go to check in on our order since we hadn't been called yet and our pizza is on the counter, gathering dust. When we open the pizza box, much to our dismay, the pizza was undercooked and soggy. The ingredients used to make the so called best pizza in Brooklyn were alright and the crust was be biggest disappointment. The pizza was cold, soggy and lacked flavor. I figured they were having a bad day. After all, how could the best pizza in Brooklyn, reviewed by popular established guides like Michelin, be the worst pizza of the day? I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Two months later, when tasked to organize a pizza event for my company, I thought of no other place than Roberta's. The OG Roberta's in Bushwick. I figured that would be the best place to eat really good pizza, indulge in some refreshing cocktails, and have an overall great vibe. Boy was I wrong! Made the reservation two weeks ahead of time since we were a big group. Confirmed the reservation the day before and I kid you not, 3 hours before the reservation they text me saying that ""Unfortunately Roberta's full service restaurant will be closed tonight. Our pizza Take Out and Tiki bar will remain open as well as indoor self service seating. Deepest apologies for the inconvenience."" That's it. I tried calling the restaurant and no one even picked up. I'm not mad, just extremely disappointed. It's a completely unreliable restaurant that hasn't shown much love or hospitality to its customers. They kinda just think they are above everyone else. I expected a better experience with Roberta's. It's a shame because I haven't even been able to really eat there and I already have a negative desire to ever try going there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/robertas-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jessica B.,/user_details?userid=s_-TYGBssO75kC7VWRG5DQ,"Queens, NY",9/14/2019,4.0,"A nice pizza place in Brooklyn that's very hipster. They have a lot of graffiti out front and two fire pits out on the street that makes the block very smoky. There is a ""garden"" where I find people sitting on benches drinking beer and a storefront where you can order to take out or delivery. They also have a restroom there in addition to selling various baked goods and their own merchandises. I tried the beastmaster and was delicious! The pizza is thin and the dough is soft. The beastmaster comes with pieces of sausages, onions, and jalapenos with a hint of sourness. It is very difficult to find parking there, but good thing I found one because I ate in the car thinking there was no sit-in area except for a bench right in front of the store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/robertas-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
