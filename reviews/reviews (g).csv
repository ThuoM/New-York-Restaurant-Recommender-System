Mediocre at best so disappointing cause Korean barbecue could be so good. I guess we should have gone to Korea Town but we just didn't want to go that far.

Katherine M.,/user_details?userid=_Z1Rt_wdYu0qGWP7Z_j24w,"Brooklyn, NY",1/7/2020,4.0,We came here on a Sunday evening so there was a lot of available tables. I definitely recommend the hot & crispy baby back ribs! The potato salad banchan was really good so we asked for seconds. It wasn't free though! Their banchan is not free unlike other Korean restaurants I go to. I didn't really like the stone bowl because it had too much kimchi and not enough rice.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kook-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Milo C.,/user_details?userid=9fRs1gEVY8dHWnpRkdLe4Q,"Manhattan, NY",6/29/2020,5.0,"During the Phase 2 opening of NYC, I decided to give outdoor dining a try and so I came to K'OOK for an excellent experience. They have revamped the outside to include outdoor seating with partitions and spaced tables. They even put out nice plants for you to look at and made it a real restaurant experience. The waitress was extremely nice and friendly and started me off with appetizers and drinks. The Pinot noir I got was very good. The appetizers were great as well, plus you can never complain about complimentary appetizers. I got the fried egg as an appetizer as well and it exceeded my expectations, and was priced very fair. It was covered in spicy mayo which I love, and the egg was cooked very well. For dinner I got a beef Bibibop, which came in a bowl with a side of rice for me to add in. Although I'm used to it already mixed in with the sauce, I liked that you can add your own sauce so you can measure for yourself how much you want. They did a great job of social distancing and re-opening the restaurant. I will sure be back, and plan to support small local East village restaurants like K'OOK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kook-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I've been to K'OOK three times, all during the pandemic, and have been amazed each time. The food is incredible and the prices are amazing for how much food you get. Their outdoor seating is comfortable, I didn't feel too close to other people. They also have multiple heaters for when it's cold out, which is great during the crazy winter weather! They start you out with some complimentary appetizers of kimchi, potato/macaroni salad, bean sprouts, and greens. I've had their noodle soup, chicken wings, bibimbap, friend rice egg, and soju cocktails and everything was incredible. The chicken wings are simply amazing, we had them with the soy garlic sauce and they were the best wings I've ever had.

Katina S.,/user_details?userid=yHyg69vRGFNcUfXgmfRTnQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/1/2021,2.0,"I don't even know who's tasteless soul was cooking that Wednesday night, but our dishes were lacking in every way and service was a whole other issue. Let's start with the scotch egg, which is responsible for 1 star. You can get a scotch egg at every other pub in NYC- this one had spicy Mayo on, it wasn't mind blowing but compared to the rest - it was one of the 2 better items. The star was one of the ban Chan sides- Mexican achiote in a Korean dressing, this earned them their 2nd star. So, that makes 2 of the stars given to food that isn't even Korean. I ordered the ox bone marrow soup- the marrow was invisible and the soup looked like murky dishwater and Tasted like it too. To give it flavor, I was given salt. Lol no amount of salt could have fixed it and I tried. My friend ordered the spicy beef soup which came with dry, over-cooked meat and lackluster flavor, but my friend shared since mine was gross. We couldn't get a refill on water until the end of our meal, good thing my friend came with a bottle of water and napkins bc apparently that's hard to come by at K'ook. The soju flight came out with the food and one tasted like a lemon drop shot and another like a green jolly rancher shot, the lychee and whatever the other one was were less than stellar and I'm not even sure there was Soju in any of them. Don't waste your time or money, so many gems in the area- this isn't one of them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kook-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Linan C.,/user_details?userid=HD7h6Pty8wZnDwR6uBJZtQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",11/20/2018,4.0,This place is quite hidden because it is a half basement surrounded by a lot of apartments.

The cheese dubboki had maybe a small glob or cheese, was diluted and barely any rice cakes- it was mostly onion and green peppers. The ""corny corn corn"" appetizer was also very watery and sickly looking in color. To my surprise, there was barely any corn- mostly onion and green peppers again. I tried but could not eat it. The kalbi was average and priced cheaper than most places so no major qualms. All in all... I'm incredibly disappointed that I spent $50 on this delivery and still, very hungry.

Alex C.,/user_details?userid=Bd_AsKVXrzc-jGfYBLqpKQ,"Chicago, IL",6/29/2019,4.0,"It was Friday night and I was tryna find a Korean restaurant near by Gramercy. I was torn between Thursday Kitchen and K'OOK. Thursday Kitchen had way more reviews, but when I showed up it was a 2 hrs wait. So I decided to go to K'OOK. It was perfect because there was no line. After sitting down, I immediately knew that the crispy rice egg was one of the most popular options. I thought it was crunchy and delicious, but It would have been better with some cheese. I also ordered corn with cheese. It came with some bell peppers and onions. It went very well with the crispy rice egg. I highly recommend you pair the two dishes together. The sundubujjiga was a little too spicy. It was ok. It could have been better. The galbijjim was savory. The meat was soft, and the juice went really well with the rice. Overall the food was good, but the sitting was too close together. You can hear other people's conversations. Definitely not a intimate date spot.

The side of kimchi came in the CUTEST LITTLE GLASS JAR that I can use later!!! I'm in shock that it was only $3 and they make it in house.

Diana S.,/user_details?userid=XYV8Q1JstT7-QW0W6uMm5A,"Brooklyn, NY",3/9/2017,3.0,"Seeing such mixed reviews about the food, the thing that kept me interested about this place was the crispy scotch egg. I'm giving it 3 stars because the service was great but the food is mediocre. I came with a friend around 6pm on a Saturday and had a bit of trouble finding it until we saw a sign with their menu on it (the restaurant is hidden down the steps). It was pretty empty so we were seated quickly. We ordered the soju sample set, crispy scotch egg, snowky, and budae jjigae (army base stew). The soju sample set came with 4 different flavored sojus and was what you can expect from fruity sojus. It was great that we were able to sample the different flavors instead of having to order each one individually. The crispy scotch egg was hands down our favorite part of the meal (you must try it if you're here!!). The snowky is rice cake sautéed with ham, bacon, mushroom, cheese, and matcha in cream sauce. It looked good in the pictures so we decided to try it but it was only ok, nothing too special and was just rice cakes in a cream based sauce instead of the usual spicy red pepper paste. The budae jjigae was what you can expect from other korean restaurants and was also nothing too special. I would say that K'OOK is still worth a try, especially for the crispy scotch egg!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kook-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It can get pretty packed on the weekends so if you're going at a prime time you may have to wait but we've always been lucky and gotten a table. I have to say though - I've been 4 times now I think and the service is always pretty slow. This time we waited 20 minutes just for someone to take our drink order and they were less than half full. The staff is nice and apologetic, but I really feel there's never enough staff. But that aside I love the décor and vibe here and am never disappointed with the food.

Chicken wings - free with yelp check-in - pretty decent size, juicy, and finger lickin tasty. Only ""complaint"" would be I wish it were crunchier (I'm used to bonchon crunchy but maybe because the chained Korean fried chickens use more batter). It was still very good nonetheless. Pork belly - very tasty and juicy, wish the slices were thicker. Scotch egg - mmm crunchy and very satisfying. Galbijjim - flavor was definitely there, I wish it came with more than just 3 pieces (for $18). The meat was somewhat tender and had a bite to it, with that said...I'm used to and prefer my Galbijjim meat more tender and in thicker/stickier stew. I'm a fan of tea infused alcohol so I ordered the earl grey infused soju. I think it needed some sugar in the mix.

As a Korean, seeing that this place was Korean-owned and had basic Korean dishes, I thought it'd be a fine easy meal with my boyfriend. Little did I know it would be the lowest quality and least tasty Korean food of my life. I was legitimately shocked at the flavorless soondubu and ""Dynamic Bowl."" The banchan (or ""side dishes"") were also not properly seasoned. I was literally shocked that a Korean-owned restaurant could sell such food, and not be embarrassed to be profiting off of something that is such a misrepresentation of Korean flavor. Also, the service was below average, with the waitress bumping into me several times and dropping my chopsticks off the table twice. I am so upset that I ate even one bite of this food.

What a good mix with the spicy mayo as well. We also tried the soy garlic wings which was really crispy on the outside. At this point I was impressed with the food and when the ox bone soup (unseasoned) came out and we tried that, I knew I found my go to place. This place had all the Korean food I want to eat at a really reasonable price! The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the cheesy rice cake dish. The sizzling platter made the cheese melt to the point of just oil everywhere especially since there were slices of hot dog. Not very appetizing. But overall a very good experience.

This time I got the dynamic stone bowl($12) and my friend got the goon mandu($5) which comes with 4 dumplings, and the crispy rice egg($3). I enjoyed my bowl, however my friend was a bit surprised at the serving size of the dumpling order. They are 4 relatively small sized dumplings so don't expect to get full off of it. Taste wise, I believe it was ok but my friend said he wished it was a bit more meaty with less sweet potato noodles inside. The thing about the crispy fried egg was that it was noticeably smaller than the last time we came in. We weren't sure if we just got it big last time, or if this time it came smaller. Consistency is something I would suggest. We also checked in on yelp and got the free dak twigim and this time we tried the soy garlic which was alright, but we definitely preferred the hot and spicy much more. We also heard about the flavored soju and wanted to try that and were able to get samples. We tried the peach flavored soju and I would highly recommend it. Doesn't taste watered down like i was expecting and was surprising good (if you're a soju or vodka fan, get it). If the restaurant ambiance was a bit more upbeat and loud I would def come here and get it with some side dishes. The wait staff and owner was again on point and no issue there.

I came with my friend because we did not want to travel so far to ktown and wanted some korean food. We ordered a crispy rice egg, corn corny corn, and dynamic stone bowl. The crispy rice egg was pretty good. It is boil egg wrapped in meat and rice and deep fried. The contrast in textures with the crunchy shell and the soft egg was great. The Dynamic stone bowl I got is with some sort of radish kimchi, spinach, bacon, cheese, and egg in a sizzling pot with rice. The kimchi was actually really salty so luckily there was the rice and spinach to balance everything out or else it would have been unbearable. As for the corn, it was really nothing special.. corn, cheese, peppers, and onions.. something that anyone can make at home. Also to note they do give 4 different banchans and if you want to refill them, u need to pay (I believe). Which is kind of weird to me because korean places usually refill side dishes for free but I guess it's not your average korean place. I think I need to find some time to come back and try the stews to see how they are. I like the family owned feel korean restaurants but there aren't any available in lower manhattan.

I  finally get to try the scotch egg after hearing so much about them. I was not disappointed, It was delicious! You absolutely have to try it, it is that good. The braised pork belly (soft dwaeji) was pretty too. Warning, it is pretty fatty/heavy so you might get overwhelmed after a few bites. so take it slow. I also ordered the army stew (budae jjigae), it was pretty disappointing to say the least. It was overly salty and spicy. I had less than 5 bites and my throat was hurting from the amount of salt and spice from the stew. My boyfriend ordered the dynamic stone bowl, he too was dissatisfied with his entree. The rice bowl was covered by a mountain of greens and when its mixed with the rice, the raw salad added an unpleasant bitter taste to the dish. I had high hopes for this place, but sadly it didn't live up to the expectation.

We also ordered the pork belly, snowky (cheese teokbokki) and the kimchi cheese dol'sot (bibimbap). Pork belly was fine, sauce helped but the bibimbap was sort of bland and I barely tasted anything besides rice and the romaine lettuce(?); the snowky was nothing special, just sliced hot dogs with onions, peppers and rice cakes doused in cheese.

Chelsea P.,/user_details?userid=PHVGUeauQqCL9U_GsrHW-A,"Brooklyn, NY",1/16/2023,4.0,Antidote is a cool spot the vibes are lovely . I loved the place and the decor . First the service . That's why a star is off I felt like they weren't observant . It took a while to get just appetizers and drinks . Then our food came out . There wasn't someone coming back asking if we were good or needed anything . The servers were just very absent honestly . The food :I had the scallion pancakes. They were greasy and very flaky . I usually like my scallion pancakes with a little softness and flakiness to it . There was no balance . I did enjoy the eggplant with garlic sauce a lot . It's one of the best I've had . Also my other hiccup was the fact that rice didn't come with the entrees . Overall it's a cool spot will I be back ? Not sure but we will see .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/antidote-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

As for the food, my favorites were the spicy cumin lamb and beef in chili oil -- must order if you enjoy spicy food!! Sadly, I was disappointed by two of their popular dishes, crab tofu and curry fried rice. The tofu was soft and cooked well but did not have much flavor, bland. The fried rice with the curry flavor also did not go well together in my opinion. As for the other dishes, they were all delicious as well! I definitely want to come back here to try the other dishes!!

I wouldn't want to sit outside though as it doesn't have the same charm. We sat at the bar since we didn't have a reservation. Service was solid, drinks and food came out timely. We didn't tty any cocktails but all 3 of us were impressed with the wine selection by the glass. We had pork and vegetable dumplings (both were good but the pork was better--also, the dough was a bit too thick for us). The King Pao chicken was a hit as was the Feihong Spicy Prawn dish.

The food is absolutely incredible, the price is right and the room is trendy but not too hey look at me. There's not one questionable dish. Small plates, dim sum, noodles and entrees all top quality. Standouts are the crispy beef jerky, the fried chicken, shredded beef and bamboo shoots, Dan Dan noodles, wood ear mushrooms and the ribs. the ONLY thing they could improve on is the service. Both times I went I had to flag down the bartender or waitress after a good amount of time waiting without someone coming to the table to greet us, so we could order a drink and then again later so we could to order food.

Some of the spicy dishes were SPICYYYY and you must caution when ordering. A lot of the dishes they use Szechuan peppercorns so it's a numbing spicy. We left stuffed and our bellies happy.

Also, it took forever for our drinks to come. Our friend got her drink, and me and our other friend had to wait 15 minutes for ours, and our friend was done with her drink by then.

First, let's talk ambiance. Decor and setting were awesome. Great place to go for a date night in BK. Food, 10/10. It was delicious. Spicy fries were an absolute stand out. From soup dumplings to sui mai and more, they really didn't miss. Drinks, another 10/10. Drinks were cool, delicious, unique, and their raspberry tequila drink is a top 10 in NYC. Music, Jazz music was crazy loud, couldn't hear each other speaking, that was unfortunate. Jazz was nice, just turn it down. Then, very weirdly, they did a last call for food around 9:45pm. This is NYC on a Wednesday night? At 10pm we tried to order a final drink...denied, bar was closed. By 10:08pm the lights were on and they were kicking us out!

I understand we live in NYC and a $17 cocktail is expected at this point, but I found our drinks to be pretty underwhelming. I've had much better cocktails in Brooklyn for cheaper. I really liked our starters (mushroom salad and cabbage) but our mains were lackluster. My partner got the beef with bamboo shoots and I got the spicy chicken which was extremely dry and had no other flavor profile beyond just being spicy.

Michelle C.,/user_details?userid=ZJCFTNrydVMcV4U0mZ_EAw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/26/2020,4.0,"I really enjoyed the food over at Hak Box, but the menu is limited to only three items: rice noodle rolls ($2.50), stuffed tofu ($5/2pcs), and dumplings ($3/4pcs). On the bright side, you can sample everything for only $11. The most memorable of the three, in my opinion, is the rice noodle rolls. Unlike the Cantonese-style cheong fun, the rolls at HakBox are firmer in texture and more robust in flavor and size. The rice noodle base is dotted with salted pork and dried shrimp, rolled into a thick tube and topped with a scallion-oil garnish.

These rolls were longer than what I have had elsewhere and full of meat and scallions. The dumplings are $4 for 3 dumplings. The dumplings were plump and had a lot of meat. The tofu was $5 and you get two pieces. This was cooked perfectly. Overall, the food was yummy and close to what I use to have at South Wind. With Covid hours, they open at 10AM. Closed on Mondays. The woman in front of me ordered 5 dumpling orders. When it was my turn, the owner had 2 dumpling orders left but he said he would be making more during the day.

I liked how it had veggies in it, but some pieces of the meat are a bit dry since it's deep fried. It's definitely a bit on the rich side and the portion size is large so I had leftovers for another meal. My friends got the sigsig which was also pretty good, but I really liked the bagnet express my friend got! We also got the halo halo for dessert which was tasty and not too sweet.

Also got the pesto pasta with nice thick noodles that I LOVED the cook and texture of it.

Went here for dinner last night and we waited a bit past our reservation time, which is fine on a Saturday night in New York. I'm surprised that no one offered us a drink menu while we waited, but whatever. Let's get to the food... honestly subpar. The gnocchi appetizer was borderline nasty and extremely chewy. The broccoli dish came with 4 pieces of broccoli lol. And the burrata had some strange fish on it. Burrata and fish - not a great combo. I've never not wanted to finish a burrata dish at a restaurant before. The polenta fries were inedible (they took this off our check which is kind, and we didn't ask for them to do that).

Maybe it's a better question for nys tax agency (double taxing). As I left  I noticed there was a poster in window with $4.29. She  could've just said the prices increase and we're using the rest of the old flyers (Duh).  Then I get chicken where one piece has no skin, I take it back and another worker says what's wrong with it. Really no skin is on it, the most important part of my fried chicken. Good thing I checked before leaving.  She did try to rectify by giving me an additional piece.

Asma S.,/user_details?userid=NNdfM9PcnhYZljQDnIAvyg,"Central Arlington, Arlington, TX",10/26/2019,5.0,"Wow. Best meal and service I could've asked for. Being a native Texan, I didn't have huge hopes for southern food up here but boy was I pleasantly surprised. The fried chicken was crisp, juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The boneless strips were just as good as the bone in pieces and that's something you don't see very often (even in the south!!). The collards were to die for....so savory, just enough bite, packed with seasoning and flavor, perfect greens to broth ratio. The fries were some of the crunchiest and crispiest I've ever had while still being fluffy inside. I mean at this point you think I'm just making things up but I'm dead serious. We were there for at least an hour and our fries were still just as crisp as when they first hit the table. I don't know what they do to those potatoes but it's incredible. The Mac and cheese was sooooo creamy and rich. It has a cheesy, crunchy topping that gets mixed into your serving and it gives such a unique flavor and texture to some bites. The biscuits are fluffy, moist and comforting. The restaurant itself is cute and relatively small but the service was impeccable. We were taken care of every second we were there and surrounded by positive energy and kindness. I don't know when I'll be back in this city, but when I am, catch me at Bobwhite Counter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bobwhite-counter-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered the bbq chicken sandwich and my bf ordered fried chicken. While the food was good- it was very cold and tasted re-heated. The bread on my sandwich was hard as if it had been placed in a microwave after toasting it. The chicken had waaaaay to much bbq sauce as if they were trying to cover the fact that it hadn't been freshly cooked. French fries were delish- maybe the only thing actually cooked fresh. Based on the great reviews of this place it's clear this may have been a one off situation and maybe they were just reheating food since business was slow.

As far away as Bangkok Thailand where believe it or not is famous for it in south east Asia( abet its a unique Thai style). Some of the very best places are in the southern part of the USA. The fried chicken dinner that I had at Bobs is among the very best that I have ever eaten. First the pieces of chicken are on the bone and the juiciest chicken that Bob himself said was created by a special brine, then fried under pressure. The result is a crispy, yet juicy and never greasy piece of chicken. You get a wing, thigh, and leg with every order( the breast is saved for the sandwich. I got mine with delicious better than mom can make Mac n cheese, and the most delicious buttery crisp biscuit you would ever have.  I would recommend Bobs to everyone that I know.

The pieces of chicken are big and juicy - generous portions. But having lived in the South, still not the BEST chicken and biscuits I've ever had.

I've never had fried chicken in candlelight! They also say they close at 10PM, but they take customers up until then because I arrived at 9:30 and did not leave until after they closed as did a few other tables, so I liked that I wasn't rushed.

Clayton C.,/user_details?userid=-o_4I5TIAitqP35zmgN0-g,"London, United Kingdom",4/30/2017,5.0,Probably the best fried chicken I've had recently. Delicious biscuits with lovely fillets of fried chicken and smothered in honey (only $3 during happy hour) and the beer and chicken for $5 something was great. Just what was needed on a hot afternoon day.

Mace D.,/user_details?userid=wEw3NgucfaiyOApYY2JXzg,"Clifton, NJ",2/28/2016,4.0,"Food was delicious. Flavoring and seasoning was great. Buffalo chicken sandwich could be a little bigger. The biscuits could have been fresher and hotter. They don't have mashed potatoes or gravy which is a no no.

First 2 times I've ordered take out and it was great. Ordered eat-in the third time and the guy who served my group was extremely rude. This is my first time writing a Yelp review. We asked, ""can we order here?"" The guy said, ""what do you think?"".. We weren't even seated yet. I was physically pushed by the same guy when we were looking for a table to sit at.

Florence F.,/user_details?userid=ZELeYdaC6bB-jBHzQe99Wg,"New York, NY",7/1/2014,4.0,I'm from the south and their fried chicken is delish! Juicy on the inside and not overly battered but crisp! Also however they season the chicken is awesome it's not bland and almost sweet because the chicken is so tasty. Thank goodness for bobwhite on those wintery nights when you need a little comfort. Their banana pudding is also awesome!!!!   I like their biscuits but am a little picky so I would say stick to the chicken and you can't go wrong.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bobwhite-counter-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
