You can order takeout at the counter or sit down to eat. I sat down and ordered the Beijing Street Noodles. The portion was honestly pretty big - lots of noodles, minced pork, and shredded cucumbers. Didn't notice the black bean sauce but overall pretty good. Overall, pretty straightforward place with nice portions and good prices for Williamsburg ($12 for this).

The food was okay, they have a happy hour that is pretty good. I tried the crispy chicken wings with soy garlic sauce, a mint mojito, and a scallion pancake. The wings were okay. They were crispy but the sauce didn't do it for me. I've had better soy garlic sauce. Also, you can't take the happy hour food to go. It must be eaten in the establishment which is okay. The ambiance was cool. It was a cool mixture of hip hop, pop and R&B. They have a couple tables where you can dine in. The service was just okay. The lady at the counter was busy doing other things each time we approached the counter. So it wasn't the best service. I asked a question about one of the food items and decided against it by the way she described it. It was almost as if we were disturbing her. I hate that feeling.

Also, I'm not going to flushing or the Bao on St Marks every time I want a soup dumpling. Â The crab and pork are delicious, get them. I wasn't a huge fan of the ""sandwich"" baos (including the duck others seem to like, it was glazed with too much soy/hoisin for me) or the non-soup dumplings.

The dan dan noodles were also exceptional. The snow pea shoots were a must order, and the Shanghai shumai were quite tasty (my friend said it reminded her of her grandmother's dishes from childhood).

If you're wanting Chinese and happen to be in this area of midtown just south of Central Park definitely consider Blue Willow. I would definitely return but it's not necessarily a place I would frequent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The only part that could have been better is the moistness of the noodle+sauce blend. It was a bit dry. The interior design is pretty cool too.

There's a constant chatter as it gets pretty busy even on a Thursday night-- reservations are highly recommended. The menu is labeled well with vegan options, and there is quite a selection of drinks. I highly recommend the cold sesame noodles, which were the perfect amount of sauce, and great nutty sweet salty flavor. They're a tiny bit spicy which added to the whole flavor profile without being painful. :) The home style tofu casserole dish is basically stewed tofu, with some bell peppers in a savory thick soy sauce base. There are shishito peppers, red bell pepper, and the fried tofu, with a generous amount of thick cut scallion. Very yummy. Presentation made it look and taste really nice but I can see it being a super comforting take out dish too. The chrysanthemum ice tea is also super refreshing and not the perfect amount of sweetness. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and want that kind of vibey sophisticated atmosphere with nice Chinese food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The vibe and aesthetic here is perfect. Smiles abound - as if they were privileged to host us. The food was outstanding. We had several dumplings, Grandmas Noodles, cauliflower stir fried (with pork belly). Each were scrumptious. Sooooo flavorful. We had a lovely pot of tea too.

Vanessa L.,/user_details?userid=axNlV76LulLJ246bG_RBOQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/1/2022,4.0,"4.5 stars! Pleasantly surprised by Blue Willow! I always pass by it during my treks to 5th Ave and usually notice small crowds by the restaurant. So, I decided to check it out with my family and friends. The interior is very beautiful, almost reminds me of Old 1950s Shanghai. As for the food, my favorites were the mapo tofu, red pork belly, and the green bean eggplant. Everything tasted very fresh and the fish and meat were tender. The spice level was also very tolerable.

First off, their Resy system is messed up and they take reservations they can't honor. We had to wait 30 minutes for ours, which is ridiculous because the whole point of the reservation is that you don't have a wait that's 20+ minutes long. They're also understaffed, but that's a common problem these days. Finally, the food is alright. The snow pea sprouts were absolutely delicious, but everything else (chili oil beef, eggplant, etc.) was just fine. Drinks came after our food.

A solid mix of traditional Szechuan with a creative twist, and it was all very well executed and flavorful. I particularly loved the Blue Willow fish (we got the sea bass), the Peking duck, and the snow pea sprouts. They have decent vegetarian options as well and accommodated my vegetarian friend who wanted to swap out meat with tofu in one of the dishes.

There was a lot of ingredients and the broth was flavorful. The Mountain Baked Fish was okay but not much fish. There was definitely a lot of vegetables though (tofu skin, lotus root, bean sprouts).

Decor has a retro vibe of a Shanghai speakeasy. We had Beef Brine Noodles Chengdu Spicy Wontons crispy shredded beef and fried rice with chicken . Â Fried rice was our favorite. The wet noodles with bits of beef were a soggy mess and bland. Â Crispy beef was definitely crispy with a sticky sweet sauce. Beef was chewy and had an unpleasant fryer oil aftertaste. Â Spicy wontons were ok. The chili crisp was good and spicy but the wontons themselves had almost no filling which was disappointing. Â We also had pan fried dumplings with pork to start . Were ok but ultimately forgettable. Â Lastly , service was lacking despite staff dashing to expedite food.

Then when when we were finally ready to order around 2:50pm for the lunch special the waitress didn't come by until 3:02pm (and we had to wave her down) to which she then told us ""sorry no more lunch special it ended at 3pm"". I mean cmon by 2min and we were ready to order long before. We tried to reason with her but she explained that the the system they use on their iPads automatically prohibit them from giving out the lunch special at 3pm.

Helen Y.,/user_details?userid=ws8flq1p7oSbgYIg2eyUvg,"Long Beach, CA",4/6/2022,4.0,"For the location, this might be one of the better option for Asian food around the area if you can't go to Flushing. We made a reservation for a table of 10 people. It would have been nice to know ahead of time that they require a minimum spending. You may want to confirm with them before booking a rsvp. For a group if 10, they required spending minimum $350. In the end, it came out about $35 per person which wasn't bad. But it's good to know still. The decor was great. I love the Shanghai vibes it gives out. We were able to get our own table that's more private. Food came out super fast. Some food were not good and those are usually the super fast ones that come out. The steam dumpling definitely taste like it's been sitting out a bit and reheated. Part of the dumpling skin tasted dry. The fried dumpling taste better because it was skillet on the bottom and came out warmer. I wouldn't get the ginger chicken. That one just doesn't taste good. But for their better food, you need to order the dishes that require preparation. One of their better dish is the dry pot where you can customize the meat and vegetables. It's still on the saltier side but definitely one of their better dishes. Their vegetable dishes such as fried green bean and the snow pea leaves were delicious. I was impressed by the snow pea leaves as it was fresh and taste really good. You'll need some veggies as the meat dishes may all be a bit salty. Actually, I think most of the vegetables dishes taste pretty good. The chicken soup was pretty good. The other good dish is probably the Peking duck. They don't have the bao for the wrap. Instead, they have the thin mushu wrap. But still, that one was one of the better dish to get. The beef skewers doesn't taste like beef. I think the meat is tenderized and tasted like fatty pork but others thought it was fish. No one in the table ordered it and everyone guess wrong. The beef in chili oil isn't prepared in traditional way, but still pretty good. The seafood fried rice was actually pretty good too. Our waiter, Terry, Â was very helpful and friendly. He helped accommodate our requests and had lots of patiences with it large group. Overall, I think this was still a pretty decent place for food especially when you're trying to accommodate such a large group for dinner.

Andy Y.,/user_details?userid=EOdNt58yKwnqQLe0fJ2ovw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/30/2022,5.0,"Blue Willow is famous for its Mala Dry Pot, and the menu lets you choose what goes into it, which gives you a lot of optionality with protein, vegetables, and overall portion sizes. Along with this, we ordered the salt and pepper prawns. The bar tender who took our order made sure to warn us that the prawns came with the shell. I personally wasn't a fan of eating the prawns with their salt and pepper shells, but it offered an unfamiliar flavor profile that I could appreciate. The dry pot came out promptly afterward, and it was perfectly spicy enough. We ordered the pork belly, fatty beef, bok choy, lotus, potato slices, and enoki mushrooms. For me, the potato slices were the unexpected star of the dish, defusing some of the numbing spice. For two people, we couldn't finish everything, so I took some of the dry pot home to re-cook for the next day's lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jordan W.,/user_details?userid=H4Z_Ltb32c8jmNP5bK92Pg,"Virginia Highland, Atlanta, GA",5/26/2022,5.0,"A hidden gem in midtown, Blue Willow is the spot for Chinese classics in an elevated atmosphere. First of all, the restaurant is gorgeously decorated in a palette of dimly-lit reds and yellow, and is romantic and retro. We didn't get the best table, and were a bit wedged between two noisy parties, but the food more than made up for it. You might expect detached or esoteric dishes here, but Blue Willow delivers the familiar NYC-style Chinese classics. We started with the perfectly tangy and salty cucumber salad and an order of spicy wok-fried green beans. For our entrees, she got the golden yolk tofu, a creamy tofu casserole in an beautifully-pastel yellow egg yolk sauce that reminded me of egg salad in the best way, whereas I had the hard-to-find vegan mapo tofu, which was spicy, saucy, delicious. Our meal, paired with a couple dirty martinis, made for a nice Chinese meal out in NYC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Trendy, hip places always make me skeptical about the food (especially with Asian food) because they can draw people in with their vibes so I guess they can slack on the food but no this place has it all. Also prices are reasonable. Everything was yum but I want to point out the century egg clay pot especially. I am not the biggest fan of century egg on its own because it can be dense and is definitely an acquired taste (I grew up eating it) but I've never had it prepared this way - the server will mash the dish in front of you, it's a cold dish comprised of century egg, eggplant, and some spicy green peppers.

Â The scallion pancakes were decent, calamari was good but the dish was a bit small with 6 pieces of calamari (I liked the peppers mixed in there though!), mapo tofu could have been better, and the big disappointment was the Changsha spiced chicken. Â There were fingernail size pieces of fried chicken (mostly batter though), peanuts and way too many red peppers (they weren't spicy, but the dish was more dried peppers than anything else).

It is located in midtown Manhattan, right next to Central Park. Amid the towering skyscrapers, the restaurant has a cinematic 1920s China style decoration, which creates a unique atmosphere that combines modern and vintage vibes. It serves the best Chinese food I have ever had since I came to the United States. My favorite dish, Mala Dry Pot, has a rich spicy flavor that I thoroughly enjoyed. I have been to many Chinese restaurants, but Blue Willow has the most authentic taste. I strongly recommend this restaurant to Chinese students who miss the taste of home and people who like Chinese food in general. The fact that I went there three times in four days can self-illustrate how good the restaurant is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Karen C.,/user_details?userid=A3BmfrFtpGHrJpCygh2Tng,"New York, NY",5/31/2022,2.0,"I made reservations ahead given it was Memorial Day and I was really looking forward to returning to Blue Willow... however, it was such a disappointment. We ordered the sweet and sour spare ribs, garlic sauced pork belly, husband & wife special, Qing Hua Jiao fish, and eggplant & beans. The sweet and sour spare ribs dish was such a huge disappointment. The ribs showed up looking like they were just blanched missing the sweet and sour sauce. I've been here before and that's not what the dish looked like during my previous visits or how this should look like anywhere else. I took a bite and immediately spat out the meat. There was no taste except that porky flavor which was not the most pleasant. We told our server about it and he took the dish to the kitchen. Then he came back saying this is how the dish is supposed to look like according to the chef. It was total bullshit and we cancelled that dish. (I'm posting a photo of what it should look like and a photo of what we got for your reference.) The other dishes were alright... they also placed the wrong order for the fish and we got Xiang River Fish instead. We were in and out of the restaurant in 40 mins and didn't want to linger further after such a disappointing meal.

We got a variety of dishes from fried rice to dan dan noodles to string beans. It was indeed super spicy and mala but the yellow beef and frog really stood well.

Stephanie W.,/user_details?userid=YkmMTGQYKt6CcxT19KAbNQ,"New York, NY",5/22/2021,3.0,"I really wanted to like it but everything was mediocre. The restaurant itself is beautiful. It has an old Shanghainese feel to it and the decorations are on point. I had a reservation for a birthday dinner and I brought in a cake beforehand the day of. We got seated in a room and ordered drinks and food. We also checked in to get the chrysanthemum iced tea. For drinks we tried the empress Wu, good fortune, lychee martini, and lost in translation. The drinks were okayyy, some of them were too artificial and some had a interesting blend of flavors. Presentation was better. For food wise we got the numbing beef tendon cold plate, chengdu Dan Dan noodles, chili oil braised beef, eggplant and beans, golden prawn, ma ma peppercorn fish, and mapo tofu. My favorite out of all the dishes was the golden prawn because they have it fried in a egg yolk covering. The dishes were also on the smaller side so this was just right for 6 people. Â The issue came later on when they gave us the check but they charged us for the chrysanthemum tea so we told them and they said they'll take it off and then it took half an hour for the check to come back. In between that time another server came by with the check again and we told them again but this server said we had to write a review on the spot but the other server said it was fine. Then we asked about the cake and they couldn't find it and it took another 20 min for them to bring the cake into the room and left. So waiting for the check and getting it corrected took over half an hr.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I think the reviews here are about as valid as reviews on Amazon. Get a bunch of friends to post good things. The service was absolutely horrible. We were informed when we were seated Â that we had a 90 minute limit, which we were fine with, but then it took 20 minutes to take our drink order. We wound up ordering our dinner at the same time since we had had plenty of time to look at the menu and the food for 3 of the 4 of us came quickly, but they totally forgot my son's food and trying to flag someone to remind them to forever. Then it took 20 minutes to bring him his food while ours got cold waiting for his. It was shrimp fried rice which does not take long to cook. I will say his was the tastiest meal. My sesame chicken was average, my daughter's kung pao chicken was tasteless and while my husband's General Tso chicken was spicy as promised, it was super dry. The glass of Sancerre was a half glass.

Kiley C.,/user_details?userid=ul0dFkxEw5Iduz4nR_eajQ,"Dallas, TX",11/21/2021,3.0,"Food was delicious. Service was pretty terrible...so giving 3 stars. It was packed on a Sunday night. We had a reservation and were seated promptly but no one came to our table for about 20 minutes other than to give us waters. Finally my husband went up to the bar to order our drinks. Every time we wanted to order something we had to flag down someone to come to our table. We had about 5 different waiters over the course of dinner take our order and drop off food. No one ever greeted us, walked us through the menu, asked if we were ok, how was the food, could they bring us anything else, did we want another drink. It's almost like they forgot about us. BUT the Dan Dan noodles, soup dumplings and salt and pepper prawns were amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Rahimullah R.,/user_details?userid=bvMPsgVulEaQaQxyZ4d6Ng,"Queens, Queens, NY",6/28/2021,5.0,"We visited on Sunday(come before 6 because they usually busy after 7.) This is my first time in Blue Willow and YOU have to go! It's the big spot with amazing food. The service we received was so amazing and we will definitely be back again. The server is amazing! She made us feel welcomed and gave us an amazing experience. And she recommended great food to us and we definitely LOVE those!!! And I love the Eggplant, beans and braised pork there:) Â If you can eat spicy this is MUST TRY and they have a lot of foods here. We will come back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Emily C.,/user_details?userid=6k67PdR-Hi0JBxx3kMjLPg,"Providence, RI",3/30/2022,1.0,"The menu looks incredibly promising, but the food falls so short at Blue Willow. First of all, the food does not come out hot. Every dish we received was lukewarm, and we had to ask for the food to be reheated. Second of all, we ordered the snow pea leaves but they failed to cut off the ends of the vegetables, so the dish was incredibly fibrous and stringy, rendering some pieces inedible. Lastly, the dishes were not well seasoned. The snow pea dish we ordered was too sweet - it almost tasted as if the leaves were soaked in sugar. Would not recommend, especially because the restaurant is quite overpriced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Cody Y.,/user_details?userid=iq7hFlvOTk8_ec71Sbx0ug,"Houston, TX",12/5/2021,5.0,The absolute best meal of our trip. Cannot recommend this restaurant enough. The Chili Oil Braised Beef and Spicy Crispy Wontons are must tries.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
