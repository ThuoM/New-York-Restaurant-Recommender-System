As for entrees, we got the BBH Beef Shank and it was a flavor explosion in my mouth. It was so much food that we had to take 75% of it home.

Banh mi board came out first, and boy, it was delicious. Basically a deconstructed banh mi. Monsieur platter was good too, but wasn't anything amazing. The shrimp and bone marrow were exceptional and everyone at the table agreed. The plate that didn't really impress me was the beef shank. It was bland and lacked flavor for me, and my fiance agreed.

Peter V.,/user_details?userid=NAf51WR2445lhYXtn8C1VQ,"New York, NY",12/1/2022,4.0,I had a good experience here with a couple of nitpicks that are really just personal preferences. The marrow has a nice salty texture on the surface. It has a nice kick and might be a little too salty on it's own but the baguette cuts it very nicely. The crispy rice did crispy rice things and that Vietnamese sausage and anchovy had that bacon effect (where it just makes things better). The okra was flavorful but i like my fried Okra to not be so wet - i would have preferred the dressing to be a dip. I'll eat this place again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/monsieur-vo-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Lucy P.,/user_details?userid=BDHnUmFbVC-1Ovgm3CnCaA,"New York, NY",1/2/2023,2.0,"Leaving three stars because the food was good but the service was trash. First, we had to wait 30 mins to be seated for a table for two, despite seeing multiple empty tables when we checked in. After waiting the 30 mins, we were seated though it didn't appear like the host was going to let us know a table was ready when we came back to check despite collecting my phone number earlier. After we got seated, a waitress filled our water glasses and walked away. We proceeded to sit there for 30 mins before someone came by with menus. Other parties, some larger than two people came, ate and left while we waited. We finally got to order and got the calamari, and the brussels pizza. We also ordered two drinks. The calamari showed up minutes after we ordered. The pizza took longer. The calamari was okay but had too much parm. The pizza was delicious though! Our drinks arrived at the table right as we were finishing up the pizza - basically at the end of the meal. We were not pleased with the service so we were trying to just get the check and go. The waiter assigned to our table did not come to check in or anything as he appeared to be too busy tending to every other of his tables except ours. I made eye contact and signaled for the check. After the check arrived and we put a card down, it took him at least 15-20 mins to come back and get it - because I made eye contact with him again to come get it. I was very disappointed with my experience, especially since I was celebrating my birthday.

B L S.,/user_details?userid=Db-EQepITRricNtxaz0dIg,"Midtown West, New York, NY",12/30/2022,1.0,"Unpleasant experience. The place was empty but the host said there's a 40 min wait. It was just me and my husband. When my husband inquired about the empty tables, the host changed the time to 10 to 15 min wait, strange, but no big deal. At the table, unfortunately, the waitress got us the wrong beer we ordered and forgot to bring my husband a coffee latte. I didn't want to waste the beer or cause trouble so we asked to keep the wrong beer but bring us the correct one plus the coffee latte. She disappeared and never saw her again. After a bit of a wait, my husband got another waiter's attention and mentioned that the previous waitress brought us the wrong beer and that he's still waiting for the coffee latte and the correct beer. He brought the right beer but wrong coffee - straight up black coffee in one cup and cold milk in the other. So my husband got the attention of another waitress and explained he didn't receive the coffee latte but regular coffee. She took it back and told the waiter who brought us the wrong coffee (who happened to be near us) what he did in Spanish. He replied that they didn't say coffee latte - not a good look from the staff.  As for the food, I don't recommend Brussels pizza - it had a foul taste and odor. The Rita pizza was nothing special - thin and dry and tasteless sauce. Sadly, we won't be going back here.

Jin C.,/user_details?userid=9G8EyOAEv5mfSOdsbrIF7A,"New York, NY",10/11/2020,5.0,"Simple Italian food done well, with just a touch of modernity. All of the dishes I had were well-balanced with complementary flavors and textures. I had the watercress and pear salad with crispy prosciutto - the prosciutto was a fancier version of bacon bits, which I enjoyed. I also liked the burratina salad with jammy figs, walnuts, maple and an unexpected hit of jalapeño. The pasta was the star of dinner: the strozzapreti pasta was just a little chewy, with these little divots that held the bolognese sauce well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aita-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

For main got oxtail ravioli with bone marrow sauce and heirloom carrot gnocchi with whipped goat cheese. Soooo delicious!!!!! Both are unique dishes and tasted amazing. We weren't sure what to drink with our meal and our waitress, Rose, helped us pair the perfect wine. Once it came to dessert Rose suggested the special which was a dark chocolate flourless almond cake with eggplant. It sounded different, but she said it was her favorite so we went with it.

We shared the pumpkin and pear soup which was good but the pepper overshadowed the more subtle flavors of the fruits, the octopus and pickled vegetables salad which offered a wonderful contrast between the tender grilled meat and the briny pickles, and the pappardelle with wild boar ragu which was delicious and not overly gamey.

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. The brunch here is very good. I ordered the 2 scrambled eggs, with bacon, potatoes and a pancake and this meal had wonderful flavors. Everything was coked the way I like it. The pancake (my absolute favorite thing in the world) was very tasty. They definitely know how to make a blueberry pancake here. The prices are pretty moderate, but I do feel that the portion was a bit small. You only get one pancake which is more of the silver dollar variety and you barely get any potatoes. Granted I was able to overlook this because it tasted good, but I like to leave a pace satisfied, not looking for something else to eat in another hour. Most places either give you way too much or not enough at all and Aita unfortunately falls in the latter category. Another small gripe was the bacon; it was a bit overcooked which kind of sucked, but again a very small thing. All in all a pretty good place.

The dark interior can seem oppressive but the lighting really lets the food shine. Tidy efficient kitchen is in sight and the staff is super attentive. Neve waited for anything! It's prolly better they make you pay ahead that way you can just focus on the food. And I would be lying if I said it was expensive. It is and yes you may leave a little hungry. But, personally I felt fine and not like a stuffed pig by the end. This is quality over quantity and I am ok with that. The neo-Scandinavian food is seafood heavy. But, each bit is refreshing and flavorful and unique. Inspired sauces and flavors drawn from nature rather than pounding the food with spices. This really lets the ingredients sing. I left pictures and am not going to say what was best, because every dish was solid. In fact what was most impressive was that the meal built. Each dish flowed into the next and in a way was better then the last. It was a truly harmonious meal. Worth the splurge for a special occasion.

Enjoyed the first dish (on kelp) and ice cream dessert less than other courses. Food arrived at a comfortable pace; usually a few minutes between each of 14 courses and about a half-dozen paired drinks. As aesthetic as it was delicious, to the extent that, for a few courses, it seemed premature for the servers to immediately cover the artpiece with sauce/etc. Maybe a solution is to ask the customer whether they'd want to pour it themselves. Nonetheless, impeccable coordinated service. Environment and scenery feel NYC-esque (more condensed and low-key than one may expect). Overall an impressive, unique, unforgettable meal.

I really liked their blue mussels! My mom didn't like the food here much because she thinks it's too light. She has always been preferring heavier ingredients and sauce. But if you like light food, you should try here! For the other two times here for wine tasting, I have to say their small bites were amazing even though the wine choices were less strong. Also I think the tasting this year almost doubled last year's price which I think is little over priced for their wine tasting event. In general I would recommend this place for dinner but not their wine tasting event if it's $150 like this year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aska-brooklyn-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Livery H.,/user_details?userid=R6orDwTWCIVEMNhWE4LeqQ,"Honolulu, HI",7/25/2018,4.0,"My bf and I arrived a little early for our reservation, so we were offered to relax at the bar downstairs. There was only one other couple downstairs, it was very intimate and cozy. The cocktail was obviously great, syrupy and smooth. We were called upstairs to our table before we finished our drinks. For the night, we opted for the full dinner menu and a drink pairing. The food was good but not as light and fresh as I was expecting for a summer visit to a Scandinavian restaurant. I thought a number of their dishes had very heavy oils that turned my stomach a bit. I am still giving them 4 stars because my bf did not agree and so this might have been a preference issue. There were some true gems offered with the drink pairing, but I have learned a lesson. I drink far more than beverage pairings offer. The waiter gave us a few ""free"" pours just because we had finished the drinks before the food got there. We never have the intention of getting drunk, but I always find myself straining to stretch those few teaspoons of fine wine. Finally, I begrudge myself for saying this, but the waitstaff was awkward. He attempted multiple times to have a conversation with us, which was fine, but his comments felt extremely perfunctory and structured. With the stringent beverage pours and the awkward staff, we felt the place was too stuffy to warrant a return for now.

Chris B.,/user_details?userid=bTgP6RjnYa9lREzqpmSxYw,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",3/19/2022,3.0,"Came here on a Friday night and sat in the back patio area, which was very well decorated and a great date night spot. Waitress was very friendly and shared a bunch of recommendations. Started with the moules which were decent. We paired that with the gougeres which were a fun little puff pastry with a nice cheese flavoring. Next we had the steak tartare, which again was pretty good, I especially appreciated the cornichons that came with it. For a main I went with the steak frites and was disappointed. Ordered medium rare and was a little overdone, but the char on the outside just gave it an overpowering burnt taste. No real flavor, no sauce to go with it, just burnt and salt. My girlfriend had the trout which was a bit better but nothing special. Overall probably wouldn't go back with all if the other options around. Maybe worth checking out for brunch or grab a drink and small bites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/french-louie-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered the eggs louie (benedict) and the creme brûlée french toast and let me tell you.... that benedict was sooooooo amazing. The hollandaise and the crab tasted so yummy together.

It was Saturday, the weather was good and as expected a lot of NYers were out in force for a Saturday night dinner which meant that I likely had to book a table early. Something, that I did not do. My first call to French Louie was such a positive exchange that in my mind, I was going to continue trying to get a table even though the time slot - 7:00 - that I wanted was booked. Persistence paid off as I was able to get a table for 7:15 after trying several other places and failed to get an early slot.

The rest of the group arrived shortly and we were seated (they did do a great job checking for vax status). The staff seemed overwhelmed from the start. Seating was tight as the place is small. Drinks were so so but the food was bland and lackluster. How is this a French brasserie and there were literally no other traditional French dishes on the menu (ercargot, croque madame, crepes, pain au chocolat etc. ) other than four socca (chickpea flatbread) dishes. Four?!? They are better off calling this place Socca Louis. I ordered the simple goat cheese and mushroom egg dish and only got small flakes of mushroom and no goat cheese. They offered me a new dish in their defense but I did not want something sugary at 2pm or a burger or chickpea flatbread.

Sierra R.,/user_details?userid=Jus7n3XR4zBIEyEj5Ur75g,"Manhattan, NY",1/7/2021,4.0,"I don't often find myself in Brooklyn on a weekend but if you do definitely stop by French Louie for brunch. Overall a great experience food and drinks were good, staff was friendly, expedient, and adhering to covid guidelines. Prices were agreeable and portion sizes were generous. Prior to going to French Louie I'd been living wrong by not bruleeing French toast. I'll never go back to that. The house made jam and crepe fresh accompanying it were great. That being said underneath the perfectly brown and crunchy topping the toast itself felt too soggy to the point of almost having a doughy texture. I'm not sure if the solution to that is soaking for less time, frying for longer or using something other than brioche as the base but if fixed that's the bet brunch plate in all 5 boroughs. The Eggs Louie with crab and Hollandaise was good! I'm not sure it needed to be a croissant on the bottom and would've preferred an English muffin. The fries were perfect. We also got the spicy chicken sausage and I was happy to see them in patty rather than link form. Also they were actually spicy which was great. A lot of places say spicy sausage and then it just isn't that. I did have to add a little bit of salt because the spice in some bites was overpowering and all you could taste so it felt a little out of balance in that respect. Overall everything was good!

The Eggs Louie are served on a croissant - a perfectly crispy one - and the crab flavor is in perfectly. The French toast - crispy on top, soft inside, served with delicious huckleberry jam, and isn't too sweet - was delightful. The potatoes were crispy, well seasoned, flavorful and not too starchy.

Can't say I had the best experience nor was it awful. The food was hit and miss. The pate was delicious. Creamy and full of flavor. The escargots was great. Awesome sauce and great combination of flavors on the plate. Steak tarte was good but slightly underseason. The duck confit was pretty good. The meat fell right off the bone and the skin was nice and crispy. The Steak frites was nothing special. The Steak was very average and the fries fried nicely but to salty. For dessert the lemon cake actually tasted old and stale. Bread pudding was average. Now for the service. Not great. They were attentive but not friendly at all. I sensed snootiness.Our first server seemed to get upset with how we ordered and not specifying it was the restaurant week prixe fix. We also was never asked if we wanted go order drinks. In mid meal we changed to a different server. Again not friendly at all. She told us our choices for dessert was a lemon cake and chocolate gateau. We order one each. When it came we got tbe lemon cake and a bread pudding. When we told the runner we were suppose to get a chocolate gateau she said no you order bread pudding. It wasn't that big of a deal so didn't want to argue. When the server came with the check we told her you gave us bread pudding she said ""oh yes they just changed it."" I think the right thing was she should have informed us and make sure it was ok. It was almost as if since it was restaurant week they'll just get what we give. There was no care what so ever. Also, when I told her the fries were too salty she hust said ok. No apology nothing. During the whole meal no one came to check of us. They did do a good job clearing the table.

The mussels were in a heavy sauce that was a tad too heavy for my liking. The 28 steak was not prepared according to our request, and it was basically overcooked. Now, considering the price of the steak, I would imagine that the care for this meat would be better. The red rice was interesting as it was mixed with greens. The chickpea pancake was probably our favorite item on our table, and it was very original as well. The downside is the noise. In fact, the table next to us was so loud that my left ear was ringing the next day. The tables are on top of each other, and the couple next to us overheard us talking about the noise level.

Honest R.,/user_details?userid=qootAccifN8IcMwUP18k1g,"Brooklyn, NY",2/18/2018,3.0,I wanted to love this place but was a little disappointed. I was here for brunch and ordered the regular bloody Mary (virgin) and felt it was a little too sour. Maybe vodka makes a big difference. I ordered the special- duck hash with a sunnyside egg- pretty tasty but very small portion. I also ordered the creme brulee french toast. I thought that was pretty good but would be much better as a desert. I decided to add on the avocado tartine because I didn't feel satisfied with my french toast. The avocado spread was just like guacamole and they did put a lot. It also has a lot of citrus so the pickled tomatoes didn't really go well but it was really pretty. The bread was overly toasted so the edges were impossible to cut through. I cut out the center and scraped the rest of the avocado off. The table next to me ordered a sandwich and the woman was putting in some serious work to try to cut through her toasted bread as well. It might've been a bad day or batch of bread. I also had the side of chicken sausage. For $7 skip it completely. It was really dry and small- just order another plate for a few more dollars. Another thing I wasn't happy about was when I asked to move to the table next to me because I was going to order more food and the table was already full. This table was a little bigger and for two people. When I arrived one person was sitting at the table so I didn't think it would be a problem for my party of two to switch over. The server asked the manager and they denied our request. They said a bigger party will be coming. Well literally 2 minutes later the host walks over a party of two and seats them at the table. When the rest of our food came out the waitress wasn't even sure where to put the plate because out table was full so we literally had to eat with our plates hanging off the sides of the table.Pretty bummed about our experience especially since it has such good reviews.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/french-louie-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Mellie J.,/user_details?userid=z6KNSw-_S5i-RyGwd3O6ow,"Brooklyn, NY",1/31/2016,4.0,"Such cute little spot, very date appropriate with its mood lighting :) I went here with friends, and it's definitely also a great place for small groups. Went here for the restaurant week deal which is 3 courses for $38. I ordered the butternut squash/sweet potato soup for my appetizer which was lumpy and didn't have a very smooth, soupy texture as it should so thumbs down to that. For the entree course I ordered the steak and frites, which was really tasty and was cooked medium (a tad on the dry side but it was tasty enough not to need so much steak sauce). My friend ordered the trout which I tried a little of - that was delicious. To finish off, I ordered the chocolate ganache cake with hibiscus mousse.

Hayley M.,/user_details?userid=ekMeevStYW6hYI_v-PwSJA,"Grand Rapids, MI",2/14/2017,4.0,"I was so excited to try this place out for brunch after never being able to get into Buttermilk Channel. The first great part about this place is that they take reservations...I feel like no one takes reservations anymore, so I was super pleased about that. When I got there (without my date mind you) they immediately sat me and brought me water. My boyfriend was a little late because parking in the area is notoriously bad, but they didn't rush me at all which was lovely. We ordered the Eggs Louie and the Trout Po Boy. The Eggs Louie were absolutely fantastic! Rich, creamy, buttery, definitely not a health-kick meal, but really great for a treat. My boyfriend said the Trout Po Boy was delicious, and something like he'd never tasted before. We really enjoyed the food here, but there was one thing that really killed the mood, hence the -1...it's so dang loud in there!! I don't know if its echo-y ceilings, loud music, or perhaps this midwesterner still isn't used to the Brooklyn brunch crowd, but it was unreasonably loud. I could not hear was my boyfriend was saying and he was sitting directly across from me. When we were leaving I noticed that the front of the restaurant was much quieter, so try and get a table up there if you're looking to chat.  Overall the food was great, but it wasn't really what we had in mind for our romantic brunch date.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/french-louie-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was about 10:30pm and I was walking in the rain to find somewhere to get some grub. Not a huge American portion, but something made with thought that would leave me with a great memory. Found it here!  I walked in and was immediately able to sit at the bar. Ordered the duck breast with mashed potatoes and olive spread, ""Allard."" I ordered it medium rare. It was phenomenal!!  The duck was a nice portion and included the skin. And if you truly love duck, then you wouldn't want to miss out on the skin. It was tender, juicy and so full of flavor!  The potatoes were great. The olives left me with the desire to make a serious effort to try to incorporate more olives into my daily schedule. I almost settled up and left after that until I realized that they had desserts!!  Ordered profiteroles with fennel ice cream and a nice drizzle of sugary goo. It was the perfect dessert!  And it really represented French portions and flavors well. Not swimming in goo. Just enough to make you enticed to sop it all up with the flaky, croissant-like profiteroles as the fennel ice cream melted. I told the bartender who served me with a smile the whole time that if I could, I would have licked the entire plate clean. The ice cream was just delicious. Thick, dense, fresh ice cream that really left me satisfied. The only down point of the experience was when I left to walk back to the apartment we are staying in and realized that I could have been dining here since Tuesday!  But we leave to return to our home in Atlanta tomorrow. Wish I could have eaten here again and again. And I truly hope they remain successful for next time I am in town so I can eat the exact same menu items. Such delicious food!!  And with the whole meal mentioned above, the bill was about $35.00. This food was made with some serious thought and love.

I was disappointed on a couple of fronts. 1. The martinis are no longer served in martini glasses. They are now using those thimble-sized little ""coupe"" glasses that so many bars are now using for cocktails. There is nothing worse than ordering a cocktail and receiving it in one of those offensively tiny glasses, especially a martini. 2. The steak comes with salad. What happens when you put a hot piece of meat on the same plate as salad? Not only was the salad wilted, but tonight, half the salad was actually rotten. Garbage. Had to scrape it to the side after inadvertently eating rotten salad with my steak.

Matthew S.,/user_details?userid=WJ6YiRL9VdNlmYB1GZyPzA,"New York, NY",6/8/2014,2.0,"So I had kept seeing French Louie pop up on a the hot and trendy lists. I also saw that  they had worked out the initial kinks that new restaurants face. After finally eating there I have to say, I don't get it. We ordered the pork and rabbit rillettes as an appetizer, it had the consistency of tuna salad and didn't have much flavor. It even looked like it had rolled over onto its side when the waiter was bringing it out even though it was upright when it made it to the table. For my entree I had ordered the roast duck breast Allard. When it was served it was served with the grey side up which made for an ugly presentation. I had flipped it over to see the whole piece and there was a nice crisp skin that was sitting in the jus that would have made the presentation 100% better if it was served that way. Aside from the presentation I had also found it a little over cooked and tough. I had tried my girlfriends also, she had ordered the roasted king mushroom and while it was ok, it seemed to miss what it was aiming for, there were earthy tones but the sauce was overly salty sweet and sour all at the same time. She had also noted that the pieces of potato she had in there were under cooked. Aside from the food, the service was nothing to write home about. Our waitress came over and then disappeared for a extended periods of time.

But as we were walking out of the restaurant, we could hear the hostess laughing with the other restaurant staff about how dumb our question was. Firstly I don't think any service establishment should allow staff to talk about their customers in that way, especially if the customers are still around and as a result I give this restaurant a zero for its service and I am sure I won't be back to try the food as there are just too many other choices in Brooklyn for me to choose from.

Jon M.,/user_details?userid=JhBmlIR6_i0XjmhsbAtruw,"Manhattan, NY",11/3/2014,4.0,"We intended to dine at La Vara but lost our table thanks to the Brooklyn Bridge being closed to traffic. (No fault to the restaurant... we blame Mayor de Blasio and the MTA for being an hour late for our reservation!) So -- finding ourselves all the way in the area between Boerum Hill and the Slope in Brooklyn, we franticly scoured Yelp on our IPhone for something we could walk to with ease. On Atlantic Avenue was a place I had heard about from friends... French Louie. Let's start with the hostess -- as warm, friendly, charming a professional as one would hope to engage on a frustrating evening. She went out of her way to accommodate our party even though the place was packed -- and it was a Saturday night! Now let's move to the physical restaurant -- a neat bar, small, intimate, very ""Brooklyn hip"" without being douche, and a restaurant that is not overly loud, elegant without being pretentious, warm, inviting... we instantly felt very comfortable. (There is a large, outdoors back dining area that must be delightful in the summer.) Now... the menu. EVERYTHING sounded delicious... with the small-plates reading as inviting as the entrees. We shared an order of gougeres (small, cheese-filled puffs) and roasted brussels sprouts with grains in a harissa yogurt. Wonderful. The ""Frenchie"" salad was far more delicious than the simple detailing on the menu -- the bacon was hand-cut and perfect. Most of us opted for different steak/frites dishes -- the aged-steak was perfect and each of our meals came to the exact specification of what we ordered -- be it rare, medium rare, etc. We got what we wanted. The only disappointment was at desert... the spiced chocolate pot de creme with orange madeleines was insane... craving it now just thinking about it... but the house-made ice cream (that evening coconut) unfortunately had too many ice-crystals to make it stand out. That was the ONLY less-than-perfect aspect to this fine restaurant. Did I mention that the service was impeccable?  Attentive without being annoying.

The service was great and we were seated right away for Saturday night dinner. The cocktail menu is extensive and the drinks were very good. We ordered the tater tots appetizer, which comes with a mayo-based sauce. It didn't really remind me of a tater tot in any way. It was more like a latke/potato pancake in a ball shape and the inside seemed undercooked. The appetizer also came out at the same time as the entrees. I had the Kahlua pork plate and the pork was incredibly tender and juicy. But there wasn't a lot of flavor to it, I wish the lomi lomi had some spice to it. The macaroni salad had an overwhelming mayo flavor. Someone at the table ordered the chicken sandwich and another person had chicken tacos and both raved about the fried chicken. Overall I thought the food was underwhelming but I might come back to try other dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweet-talk-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

His mai tai hit hard on the spiced rum but my frozen painkiller was delicious as all painkillers are. It was a quiet and empty night an hour to closing (they actually still accommodate a party of 12 very close to closing as well). No televisions and beautiful low lit bar with tiki vibes. We had 2 different elotes which were excellent, the nachos (you really need to have the pork with them because it turns the flavor to heaven), poke bowl which tasted very fresh and clean and the short rib (which despite it being the most highly reviewed dish was very outshined by the pork). We attacked everything like savages and they forgot the pork for the nachos, but this turned out to be perfect because when they came with a side dish of pork we dumped all the leftovers and made our own garbage nachos. As I'm writing this I just finished the leftovers for breakfast! Thank you for a lovely night, Sweet Talk.

Seriously, for a cocktail bar, for any restaurant, the I want to say HawaiianJapaneseKorean food is out of this world. I got three tuna tacos, my friends got the kalbi plate and the katsu plate and each came with amazing sides. We also shared the truffle fries which were the most perfectly fried fries I've ever had.

I drove back to this restaurant because we had a good experience previously ordering take out as we knew they did not deliver, but today was a little different. When I called the restaurant to let them know I was around the corner for when they are ready for the food to be picked up curbside, immediately they said we don't do that. I don't think I have an issue about going in to the restaurant but rather how it was handled. I let them know that on the ordering site it said curbside pickup was available, and that I was also by myself and couldn't just leave the car parked in a no parking zone. I was met with I can't leave either, but let me ask my manager. I could hear them talking by the phone and the same with the manager says, no tell her to come in. I think I am just a little disappointed at the service and how it was managed. Hopefully this could be addressed a little differently in the future for customers who come thinking they can order curbside.

We came very late in the afternoon around 4:30 PM so the place was quiet. The decor inside looks like it's from another era, like the 1930s (?), but it's really nice and feels European.  We sat in a corner booth by the window, the friendly server came over with menus and a smile immediately.  We started with a Fritto Misto which is basically fried calamari and shrimp in a very light breading. It came with a nice green dipping sauce.. not sure what it was, but it was good.  For the entrée I chose the Branzino fillet, although there were other options definitely worth considering.  the fresh, flaky fish was so tasty and texturally pleasing, being that the skin was crispy and also had a potato crust on top of the fillet. It was served over sautéed spinach, along with some mashed sweet potato and micro greens. I should also mention the caramelized Cipollini onions that laid on top were very flavorful.  I was eating it thinking to myself 'this dish is a 10 out of 10'.  My colleague had a Churrasco steak with steak frites and salad, and she enjoyed it very much.  They have a good happy hour deal on drinks, but we were not able to partake.

Last time we were there, our waitress took awhile to get us menus or drinks - not a big deal. Our check for 3 people came to about $100 - we left $14 since service was just alright. About 10 minutes after we paid, the waitress came back over and asked us if everything was alright because we ""only left a 10% tip"". Not only can she not do math (we tipped just under 15% on the pre-tax bill), but it was incredibly rude to call us out on how much tip we left. People forget that - while customary - you are not even required to leave a tip. I didn't know what to say - I asked her to let us recount it out of embarrassment, and then we just left out of disgust. I have a feeling the manager made her ask that, because it didn't seem in her personality to do such a rude and awkward gesture, and I saw him glaring at us on the way out. I won't go back.

Atmosphere also really good...this is a ""go-to"" spot for my friends and I. We enjoyed a nice evening at the Bell House and then had a late bite at Bar Tano...another reason we like it..they are open late to eat in the area...always a plus.  The wine we ordered was really good...although it was listed in the menu at 48 for the bottle and we were charged 50 for it on the bill (I just let it go...).  The food was great...we loved the pastas and salads we ordered. The kitchen is really on point here soo I can't give less than 3 stars for this...the low rating has to do with the service which, I would say the service was good...nothing spectacular but efficient, friendly and kind...just how it should be. However once we paid the bill...the server asked some of my party ""If everything was ok with the meal?""...to which they responded ""Yes...why?""...she claimed we left a bad tip...well we left exactly 20%...in fact we copied the ""TIP SUGGESTION"" listed on the receipt and I chose the 20% one because I thought the service was fine. Saved me from doing the math...sometimes appreciated late night...I am European but a long term 15 year resident in NYC...I HATE HATE to tip...I believe in paying people a living wage and including service in the price...like the rest of the world.  SO I am sorry that I tipped 20%...looking back at the receipt...that 20% calculated based on the pre-tax amount. We are not obligated to pay on the tax...sometimes I do..sometimes I dont...also TIPS (To Insure Prompt Service) are NOT required, ever..so just be glad you get a tip, if any at all. It was just in very bad taste...left a bad taste in our mouths after what was a yummy excellent meal. My friends ended up leaving a bit more cash to make up the few dollar difference it ended up being...which was more than generous...Please do better or get better at math.

No need for tomato sauce when you have the awesome flavors of juicy sauteed mushrooms and gooey smoked mozzarella battling it out on your slice.  I'm nearly at a loss for words thinking about it.  The hubs had the chicken scallopini and he was so into it, he basically inhaled it.

I live on the border of Park Slope and Gawanus and usually opt for the former when I go out in the neighborhood. I went to Bar Tano on a Thursday night, about an hour before their kitchen closed. The first thing I noticed walking into the restaurant was a contrast between the somewhat gritty 3rd ave area and the restaurant - the decor and lighting represented a casually refined atmosphere. The bartender and staff were also very friendly and accomodating. I ordered a Maker's Manhattan and it was definitely on the potent side (exactly how i want it). My meal, a panini was good, but not great. I thought it could use a bit more cheese or somethig else to take it to another level. The included chips were really good. Overall though for the price, it is hard to complain. I'll definitely be visiting here again soon for drinks or to check out the other menu choices.

First, we sat at the bar while waiting for a table and watched another party of 2 walk in off the street and be sat before us.  Our appetizers came with our meal, my wife received the wrong entree and I was forced to eat my entree while she waited for hers.  She then received the incorrect entree for a second time. She originally ordered a mozzarella panini with pesto. The first panini to come out was ricotta and eggplant.  When it came out again it was missing the pesto. When we told our server about it, he came back and slammed a cup of pesto on our table and walked away. We then decided to leave with her only taking two bites out of her panini.  We were only comped for her entre, even though our entire meal was ruined.

From the moment you walk in, you feel the authenticity of the place - the atmosphere, the staff and their greetings, the decor, the utensils, the presentation. We were presented with a mortar where you could grind your own sesame seeds and sea salt for seasoning. The beef curry has a beautiful nice kick to it. The pork cutlet just melts in your mouth - the balance of a slightly crunchy outside but not to greasy, finished with a soft and mildly fatty protein bite was heavenly. Highly recommend!

Simon P.,/user_details?userid=6a6iVKQDiVGQa2X-lLIE-g,"New York, NY",6/13/2021,5.0,"We are 8 people and we got a nice room at the back of the restaurant. I got the gyukatsu (wagyu sirloin cutlet) with white rice - note that the cutlets do not come with white rice. It exceeds all my expectations, I always love pork katsu and also love steak - this is like a perfect blend of the two. Very well made breaded shell that hold on tight with the steak. Perfectly cooked steak at right temperature and amazing quality too (you can actually still totally taste that it is wagyu with all the fulfilling and guilty fatty flavors). They said they sous vide the meat before making them into the katsu, which proved to give great results. My friend got the pork one so I got to taste a piece too, also really well prepared but I would vote for the wagyu. Also got the matcha affogato as a dessert and it marks a perfect end to this amazing dinner. Not on the cheap side, but if you are a katsu, and steak, lover, you cannot miss this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/prime-meat-rokko-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I remember coming here after school when I was in highschool . My school was just a few blocks away, so this was always a Friday after school treat. I see they are still a well kept establishment even after 15+ years. I also noticed they still have their famous Mango chutney dipping sauce, which they were known and famous for . I love the fact they added new sauces as well to the menu. I went around 2pm on a Friday and it was not busy at all, but believe me I know that night rush is no joke. There's a small section to sit inside and outside . I ordered the double fries of course (I had to go big I haven't been in 15+ years lol) and the 3 sauce combo. 13.00 for the double fries and 5.75 for the 3 sauce combo and of course I made sure to tip. I'm so happy to see they are still in business and still flourishing. I'm older now so I can't indulge as how I use to lol but I'll definitely be back at least once every month. Thank you for bringing me so much good memories eating these fries and sauces .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pommes-frites-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You cannot go wrong with a Belgian fry joint when it's that good. You do have to pay $5 for 3 sauces though it's worth it. The best sauce IMO is the honey mustard.

Really nice thing about this place is that they let you try as many sauces as you want before picking one. Of the 5-6 sauces we tried, the mango chutney was by far the winner for us; second was the truffle. Also liked the Parmesan peppercorn which had a pretty unique flavor.

The fries are cut thick and fried to perfection - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The really fun part is the variety of sauces you can get. Some of them are free, like ketchup, mayo, diced onions and others. For most, it comes with a charge and you pay less per sauce in case you get 3, so it is a cool chance to try some of their options at once. This time, we went with the War Sauce (mayo, peanut sauce and diced onions) and I really enjoyed it. If you try the fries with no sauce, it might feel like they don't have enough salt, but in reality they are meant to be eaten with the sauce and then everything balances out.

It is small but a decent amount of seating inside and seems like a popular spot to hang out or study. The menu is pretty simple - just different fry sizes and more sauces than you can imagine! My friend and I each got an order of regular fries but the orders are so large that even with how hungry we were, we could've definitely split and been fine. I was recommended the TLC (tequila, lime, Chipotle) sauce as it's one of the most popular and it did not disappoint! It was super tangy and delicious. My friend has several severe food allergies but she was able to enjoy the fries because they are gluten-free and was even able to pick an allergen-friendly sauce (curry ketchup I think)!

Ordered the roasted garlic and it came with the sauce on top. Sauce was decent, nothing great nor was it spectacular. I gave this 1 star because the fries was crispy even though the fries itself has no flavor. The roasted garlic aioli was drenched into the fries with layers as if my fries were drowning. This was overpowering to even continue to finish my fries.

Vittorio B.,/user_details?userid=27y601DLGlaYfpQdtVE5SA,"Riverdale, NY",7/9/2022,2.0,"These fries are prepared the Belgian way for sure, and are of quality, but they had no salt on them to speak of, so they were under-seasoned as a result. I was rather surprised that this would be the case since everyone raves about this place. To me, this is a big deal and one that can be easily corrected. I make fries at home a lot that are damn good (granted I roast mine in olive oil in the oven and season them properly), so I am generally underwhelmed when I get them out (you just can't get the same flavor frying french fries versus roasting them). That said, these have the potential to be much better. The quality of the fries was great and the black truffle sauce was good as well (get the sauce on the side as I did to avoid having your fries drowning in sauce). I also wish that they had more Belgian beer options. I went with Hoegaarden, which is good, but not really what I wanted. Not some place I would run to, but I would have it again, provided I brought salt with me next time to properly season them.

I live on Long Island but I'd sit in hours of traffic on the belt happily knowing these fries were in my future.

Xiao Ying L.,/user_details?userid=RkSSyzB3Oc0KZYShHTzoZA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/17/2020,4.0,"I find myself craving these thick Belgium style fries all the time. Pomme Frites is all about the sauces. There's something for everyone, sweet, savory, spicy. My favorite sauces are the truffle mayo and the sweet mango mayo. However, you have to make sure you're not getting an old batch because you'll get the small broken fries and nobody wants the tiny ones. They have a few benches and table in the store that will probably fit no more than 15 people but during COVID they only allow 2 groups of 3 to sit inside the store and prepared plastic covers around the table to make sure you are isolated. There were also two tables outside for outdoor dining. They also require temperature checks and your name and phone number of you want to sit inside, this is how they are keeping track of people incase there's an outbreak!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pommes-frites-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It is a tiny and cute hole in the wall that makes some of the best pomme frites. They have so many unique sauces to choose from. Personally, I think the fries are just as delicious alone as well. On a day with good weather, I would highly recommend getting fries to go and finding a spot in Washington Square Park to eat- that's what I did and it really was heavenly! They also added fresh fruit juices which helps while you're indulging your face in fries. I have tried the following sauces with my frites- Zigi's Mediterranean delight, Roasted garlic, Sun-dried tomatoes, Dill lemon, Mexican ketchup and Samurai Mayo. The 3 fruit juices they have available are Mango, Pineapple and Watermelon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pommes-frites-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Meryl F.,/user_details?userid=ejq6P87UULJU4sRjnrgRpA,"Chicago, IL",9/13/2019,5.0,"It took me months until I finally got to step foot at Pommes Frites to try the Belgian fries and unique sauces and it was worth the wait! As I stepped inside the restaurant, I felt like I was back in Europe. The space is quaint, and welcoming. Luckily we went on a Sunday afternoon in which the crowd wasn't too bad and was able to find a shared table for two. The menu is simple and when it comes to frites, there are three sizes available. We underestimated the portions and ordered the double which was hefty, but we were still able to finish. The fries were deliciously crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Now the variety of sauces can get overwhelming, there are so many to choose from! They do offer complimentary tasting for everyone of their sauces too. It's cool they offer other sauces that pairs well with fries besides ketchup, which of course they still offer. We got the three sauces for $4.25 and decided on the following flavors: rosemary garlic, pomegranate teriyaki, and white truffle ketchup. The sauces complemented the fries well and my favorite has got to be the pomegranate teriyaki, unique and jam packed with flavor! I am so excited to come back and try more of the sauces as well as the poutine fries. I'm always craving for fries and this definitely hit the spot for me!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pommes-frites-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The place is properly themed aside from the front when you come in it states it is ""Belgian style"" which it is not since that means it would've been cooked with beef flavoring or something like that (idk my hubby was explaining to me while I was half paying attention as I was devouring the fries) but everything is cooked in vegetable oil so it wasn't 100% satisfying!

Pomme Frites fits the description and makes the best fries in NYC. They give a lot of fries, stay open late and offer many sauces for their crisp and tender delicacy. Many places serve fries butter what is different about this place is how the fry is not just a food but treated as a work of art. The sauce I get with my fries is the roasted garlic aioli for a creamy and garlic taste with the food. Definitely a must have in NYC no matter what!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pommes-frites-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I saw this place on Buzzfeed or FB and was dying to try it out. They have so many sauces I couldn't even choose. I'm only giving this 4 stars because it's a bit pricey for what they give you. Don't get me wrong, the sauces I got were amazing and the french fry itself was so fricken good. I got the TLC (tequila lime chipotle), rosemary garlic, and organic black truffle. Each had a really distinctive flavor and paired well with the fries. I would love to come back and try the other flavors.

Prices are decent. Got a regular sized order of the Parmesan garlic aioli (sauce on side). Basically, you order a size of fries and pick from a plethora of dipping sauces. The fries are like a mix between a shoe string and steak fry. Be mindful, you do get charged about 1.75 for extra sauce. The regular size was more than enough for me; they also finished our order quickly.

After selling our home, I ventured on a food tour of all my favorite places. THIS WAS ONE OF THE MANY. POMME FRITES is an experience in food. As simplistic as ""frites"" are , their method of cooking them and extensive selection of sauces,dips and acctruments make the wait well worthwhile. Seasoned fried potatoes each cooked to perfection. When you get to the bottom of the cone, you are immediately saddened. My next trip up I promise meself to visit each day and post a picture review.  Im almost a ""empty nester"" now with just one ready to go off to college in the fall. As you can see 17 years later, I STILL remember the enjoyment we all had eating at Pomme Frites.  See ya soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pommes-frites-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Those golden fries come served in a cone and are easy to share (or not) with friends and family. The Garlic Aoli is one of my favorites. If you have difficulty deciding on a sauce- they will give you a sample to make sure you are content.

The truffle was the only good one, the others didn't taste so good. I was disappointed on the fries this time, not all of them were crunchy, only 10% of them were. I would recommend coming here to try but it's a one time kind of place, to say you tried it because it is well known and really good.

Lindsey A.,/user_details?userid=owjqZbaEdkIwpqZ4zzSZzQ,"Princeton, NJ",2/26/2019,5.0,The best fries in the universe! Been to the original location as well as the current; the only thing that has changed about Pommes Frites is the address! Still as delicious as ever. They are Belgian style and I believe they double fry the potatoes. So they are so crunchy and flavorful. So many tasty choices for dips. I need to try the poutine next visit. A great option if you're in need of food on the go. Just be careful not to burn your tongue--the Pommes frites are always served hot and fresh! Just as they should be.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pommes-frites-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Our food tour group seemed to love the TLC and smoked eggplant dipping sauces; it didn't have so much of an eggplant flavor as just a general smoke flavor, which was a great complement to the pomme frites. We enjoyed how fat the frites were, so you get a good chunk of potato to dunk each time. And bonus - everything was friend in vegetable oil.

The truffle ketchup is a MUST. Its slight pricey but I will say, the portions are huge. I got a small thinking I was being conservative and I could not finish it whatsoever. So many fries. You can easily share a small with another person or even 3 people if you all just want a light snack.

If you're in a snacking mood, look no further than 'Pomme Frites' on MacDougal Street! It maybe a small hole in the wall establishment but they are EXTREMELY well known for their amazing homemade Belgian styled fries and most importantly their selection of sauces! They have a handful of free sauces you can choose or their specialty sauces which are my absolute favorite! It's always good to ask the chefs which ones are their ultimately favorites as well because they know the entire list and have tried every sauce! Mine are the Sweet Mango Chutney, Parmesan and Fresh Herbs, and the Especial (frites sauce w/ ketchup & raw onion). The cones that they serve your fries in are so cute, you can share with your friends and if you choose to stay and sit there is a hole in the center of the table to place your fries down! It's so convenient but you may have to wait for a seat given that there aren't many! My goal is to try every single dipping sauce on the list so I hope to go back very soon!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pommes-frites-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's basically fresh French fries with sauce and they have quite a large selection of sauce. My favorite was that the guy working there offered me to sample some- and I expected to just get a little spoon of the sauce, instead he got a little plate with French fries and put a bit of all the sauces I wanted to try, and even suggested and threw some more samples on there. I think I got 1 sample plate and then put my order in, and he offered me to try some more while I waited! Lol I was so happy. And the sauces were great!
