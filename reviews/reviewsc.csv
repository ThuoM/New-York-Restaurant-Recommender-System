The Longjing Shrimp was beautiful to look at with the dry ice but tasted so plain even with the sauce, while the Braised pork belly had pretty good flavor but wasn't anything too special.

Arrived on the early side, a little before 5, which was perfect for securing a table before the rush really hit around 5:30. Started with the original Xiao long bao (4 total, pork filled) and the fried sticky rice pancake (peanut and brown sugar filling). Both were delicious! The bao brought the more savory flavors, with a unique and tasty sweetness from the rice pancakes with peanuts and sugar (these came in the form of 6 good sized pieces). Even the tea they bring at the start of the meal is lovely--it has an airy, refreshing, soothing quality that was wonderful to have before, during, and after eating. After the dim sum, I got the puer tea soaked rice with sea urchin. It was perfection. There was a lightness yet warmth/hominess to the dish that was incredibly satisfying. I've never tasted something quite like it, and each element of the dish was great and worked together to create a perfect bite with each spoonful.

The xiaolung bao's skin was delicate and the soup filling, flavorful. Next to arrive was the urchin rice in pu-erh tea, which was surprisingly mild in flavor and a good contrast to the sweetly flavored smoked fish. The vegetable medley called Moonlight included asparagus, lotus root, carrots, and wood ear mushrooms. Our final dish was braised eel, scallions and cucumbers to wrap up mushu style in thin rice pancakes. The pancakes were problematic because they were too thin and brittle to use without tearing.

I am writing this review after eating here for the fifth time, and every time my experience has been wonderful. The dishes are truly authentic and taste as good if not better than what I have had in Shanghai. Notable dishes include the xiao long bao, wine soaked chicken, and the fried eel. The xiao long bao is by far the best xiao long bao I have had in America. It blows din tai fung's attempts out of the water. The wine soaked chicken is incredibly flavorful and is not lacking in alcohol taste. Finally the fried eel came as a bit of a surprise but the crunchiness of the eel makes the dish great. One dish that might be overhyped though the the red braised pork belly. When I ordered it, the dish came out a little bitter as if they had burned the sugar when cooking it. Other than that though Che Li is probably the one of the most authentic Shanghainese spots in Manhattan and is definitely worth a try.

It is not the easiest to read and offers no pictures. Not only that but, many things on the menu was not available (ie. wine soaked chicken, wine soaked Atlantic blue crab, moonlight vegetable stir fry...) it was very disappointing to hear that most of the things I wanted to order were not available, especially at 5:45pm being quite early for dinner service. I ended up getting 1) stir fried water spinach ($14), 2) beef stew with pickled cabbage and chili (we couldn't even find it on the menu and ordered through a google picture), 3) seasoned half duck ($18) - honestly I would say stead clear of the duck, it was almost meatless and very tough to chew, also portion size looks much smaller than picture.

This idea of being authentic might come from its decor that reminds me of how out of the way restaurants would go to look as Chinese as possible to cater to non Asians. It is pretty. The fancy menu options that outsiders will assume is authentic because ""just fake it til you make it"" works I guess. As I said impressions. Now the Xiao Long Baos were really good but the menu was all over the place. One beef plate resembled a Sichuan style dish and had an abundance of garlic. Chicken bits with rice pieces and lettuce wrap is the chef's own creation possibly inspired by PF Chang's. My review isn't as charming as The NY Times but it's real. I was appalled at the idea of pairing ""triple sweet"" with some delicacy my friends were all trying to guess what it was which i recognized from tasting - coconut creme. Totally incompatible. And the other dessert we ordered turned out to be... *drums rolling* .. congee. Plain congee. The stuff Chinese eat for breakfast or when they're sick.

The seafood soup was soothing and reminded me of a home cooked meal. My favorites of the night were probably the seafood pancake and soft shell crab. I know you can't really go wrong with seafood pancake but it was extra fresh, fluffy and crispy here. The soft shell crab was light and airy, paired perfectly with the sauce. I also recommend getting the octopus as a starter because it was refreshing. I would probably skip the sea urchin cream bibimbap next time, I found it lacking in flavor.

Stepping through the door, I was instantly transported out of East Village and onto a train to Busan - the brown leather chairs, dark-wood wall paneling, and narrow street-facing window were clever design touches that created a handsome vintage vibe. With Busan-inspired seafood food I had never encountered, every single dish we ordered was uniquely umami and strikingly sharp. I loved the mak-hwe, which was thinly sliced raw fish (amberjack, yellowtail that night) served as ssambap lettuce wraps. We also ordered the lotus root salad, salmon hwe-muchim, spicy pork with fried squid, seafood stew, and pork soup. Both soups had harmonious layered flavors, and were comforting on a cold winter night.

Our whole experience was amazing - the greeting, prompt service, food taste/presentation, and vibes. They play really OG Korean music and the ambiance is perfect for a date or girl's night out. My top picks for the seafood were the salmon hwe-muchim and the fried soft-shell crab. We mainly tried to stick to the seafood items but the unexpected winner of tonight's meal were the chicken skewers. Soooo juicy, soft, and flavorful. They had so many fun cocktails to choose from and we ordered the Omija and Maesil. Perfect if you want something on the sweeter side. I loved that I felt full but the food didn't feel heavy. We'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.

Patricia Y.,/user_details?userid=OzEX1sCz0aU-GCqpf7j-CQ,"New York, NY",1/14/2023,5.0,"Such an amazing experience and easily now my favorite restaurant in nyc. The vibe and atmosphere is warm and inviting and the music is SO VIBEY, i love it. But most of all what took my breath away was ALL the dishes we ordered. Although I've been to a lot of variations of Korean restaurants, there's noting like this that comes close. The food is fresh, unique, new, and feels like I transported to Korea. The mak hwe - so fresh and the pairing with ssamjang and chojang is perfection. The lotus root salad and octopus hwe - the flavor in these are just amazing. The white kimchi on the octopus hwe goes so well together. I normally don't eat yukhwe but my friends ordered it and I tried it and it was SO GOOD. The fried dishes were great and the batter is so light with delicious dipping sauces. We got the spicy pork and grilled eel for the main and wow...! The grilled eel is my favorite and it's a must try. The dolsot Al bap goes without saying. It's creamy, has the right enough umami and can taste the creamy flavor of the uni cream. For the soups we got seafood and pork and you can tell they aimed to make these the star of the show. The broth is so refreshing and probably one of the best Korean soups I've had. For dessert, both the corn crème brûlée and bingsoo was amazing - loved the white chocolate on top of the corn crème brûlée and loved the consistency. The bingsoo was refreshing and the best way to end the meal. This place is alllll worth the hype. 10/10!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ariari-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

For mains, we had the Steamed Monkfish and Seafood Stew- both phenomenal choices. Monkfish was meaty, tender and flaky with perfect aromatic sauce. The seafood stew was flavorful with a nice kick, and was light without being overwhelming. They gave us a huge lobster claw, which cooked to be the most tender lobster I've ever had.

Sean W.,/user_details?userid=B4S7n_hZzv33lP44Sulg1A,"La Habra, CA",12/7/2022,4.0,"I stayed in Brooklyn for work and decided to check out Gage and Tollner. I made a reservation two days in advance, but I also dined on a weeknight. Upon entering Gage and Tollner, you can't help but notice the amazing retro decor and ambience. The bartenders were mixing up cocktails, and the crowd was buzzing in conversation. I sat down at a small table and ordered a whiskey sour. When I received my drink, I was initially taken aback by the ice in my cocktail. Ice in a whiskey sour?? It still tasted good. I ordered a New York strip and a side of mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and had a good char. The steak was so flavorful with the garlic, it was almost too powerful when paired with the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were also very rich and delicious. The steak was a little chewier than I'd hoped for, but all in all this was a good meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gage-and-tollner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Edward J.,/user_details?userid=0Sw9sDJy9beVwPX6EfOKeg,"Brooklyn, NY",1/17/2023,5.0,"This is such a quintessential New York restaurant. My Dad went to Gage and Tollner in the 80s, back when he was dating a girl from Fort Greene. My Aunt went to Gage and Tollner on her last day on the job when she worked in downtown Brooklyn more than 20 years ago. I'm sure others could find similar stories if their family members spent time in Brooklyn and were fortunate enough to visit. What I'm saying is that Gage and Tollner is one of those iconic restaurants. That means something. The landmarked interior is gorgeous, the food is good (the desserts are absolutely phenomenal), and it feels like a special event, even if it's just a Tuesday (and they save tables for walk-ins: try your luck any night of the week).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gage-and-tollner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Re launch an historic restaurant and you will have instant success. Gage and Tollner has become too popular, and it is difficult to produce high quality food at a high volume.

My Pork Shank wasn't any better. It lacked spice, and the Polenta was lumpy. Wines by the glass were tasty, but the pour was stingy.

Phil L.,/user_details?userid=fnu-cdxEWotijXVXqJOA4A,"Long Island, NY",3/19/2023,4.0,"I guess I fall into the category of old enough to remember this restaurant in it's later glory, but young enough to post a review here. My family has been dinning here since before I was born. I remember my parents would rave about the she crab soup when talking to friends and family. They would talk about the gas fueled lighting which I also found interesting. When I tried this soup for the first time, I had an emotional experience. When my wife and I first started dating, I took her here and we both ordered the soup. At that time the only gas lights were wall sconces, but the she crab soup was still mind-blowingly amazing. It was so good that you felt the need to tell other people. The restaurant closed before we had a chance to return a second time. We were all surprised by the closure. We thought this place would last forever. Then a couple of weeks ago, I was poking around online and found out about the reopening. I was quick to make a reservation. I was happy to see that everything looks pretty much the same. It's an absolute time capsule indeed. The only thing different was the young staff and patrons. I remember being one of the youngest in the restaurant before the closing, now I'm almost the oldest. We had arrived early, so we sat at the bar for cocktails which were very well executed. This gave us some needed time to soak up the well preserved surroundings. I had us added to the waiting list for the sunken harbor club upstairs, but was notified a few minutes later via text that the wait was over 2 hours. When we sat down I noticed the menu had different selections, but the she crab soup was kept a tradition. I ordered the soup. My wife had doubts about the soup being as good considering the current world situation, so she chose another option. I was hoping to prove her wrong. Well...the soup was good, but nothing like what I remembered. I let her have a taste. She knew just by looking at it that it wasn't going to be the same. She had the same opinion after she tried it. It didn't have the impact of what we remembered. The previous version was really that good, and was an experience in itself. Fortunately the rest of the food items ordered were indeed very good. The service had it's ups and downs. It took a nose dive during coffee service. No sugar or spoons were brought when the coffee was served. I asked for these items, and only one spoon came, along with sugar. As I was paying the bill, the sunken harbor hostess came over to let us know that a table was available. This little upstairs spot is not to be missed. Work out the minor kinks in the service, and please please please fix the soup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gage-and-tollner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Service and the menu are old school with an update.  I had an extremely perfect martini to start, along with the she-crab soup, which honestly wasn't so perfect at $19: it tasted delicious but there was a distinct dearth of crab.  The Parker House rolls almost made up for it, but $8 is a bit steep for 4 rolls.  Husband had the clams casino - also kinda pricey and the clams were small, but very tasty.  For my main, I had the skate wing, which I liked a lot, and there was a decent amount of fish on the chop, so I didn't feel it was overpriced at $28.  Husband got the fried chicken, which was very good, but $27 for fried chicken?? Our friends shared a shoulder of some sort of meat, and enjoyed that, but said it was a little fatty.  Food was pretty slow to come out; I don't know if that was because we were there relatively soon after it opened or if it was due to the place being packed and perhaps not having enough staff.  I didn't really mind because we hadn't seen our friends since before the pandemic and much catching up was taking place, but under other circumstances, it might have been annoying.  I will definitely give G&T another go, but it clearly won't be a place for everyday dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gage-and-tollner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I make a better NY strip steak at home. The cut was supermarket quality, but a bit thicker. The potatoes and the two different creamed spinachs were awful and all came out cold. I don't know what the owners thought these terrible side dishes added to anyone's enjoyment - other than saying to themselves ""let's try different recipes than other restaurant so everyone knows we're not anyplace else."" And so... they went with ""god-awful.""  As for ambiance, it was a bit disappointing. It looked somewhat authentic, but so does a saloon in Disney World.

Incredible from start to finish. Just walking thru those revolving doors will get you excited for what's inside, which is also amazing front to back. The vibe is perfectly classic, yet electric as soon as you walk in and you're greet by staff who makes you feel right at home. We arrived early but we were able to get a drink while we waited for our table, which they transferred to our table so we didn't have to close out twice. Both the food and menu selection were perfect for my liking. I only wish I had a larger stomach so I could have tried more. In addition to the oysters and the parker house roll, the hash brown was INSANELY good and would have stolen the show but the dry aged ribeye (to share) was one of the best I've ever had. The cocktails were perfectly made, and the sidecar they give was a fun treat which actually makes them relatively cheap if you consider the amount you get. They have all the classics and then some, including a ""perfect martini"" there which is hard to come by. The vibe, food, drink, and people - I could sit there for days on end just soaking it all in. The staff were incredible from reception, bar, and wait. All very helpful and informative and even gave recommendation of what else to do in Brooklyn during our stay. All in all a great price for a fine dining chop house. Worth every penny and then some.

Also well portioned and excellent. We washed it down with a Rob Roy for me and a Champagne Cocktail for her.

Jason B.,/user_details?userid=2jbQ0kuYlUsaYImntavivw,"Garden City, NY",7/8/2022,5.0,A literal hole in the wall you might miss with all of the scaffolding. Today I was craving an old school ny slice for lunch and il mattone hit the spot. Some tips: if you use credit there's a 4 percent surcharge. A slice is $3 cash. There's literally one chair and one table if you plan to eat there. They offer $10 and $14 lunch specials which in Tribeca is quite the deal.

This was a hint of what was to come... My oysters with crab fat butter took Umami to a whole new level. Thank goodness the order was for half a dozen. My husband had the Octopus Carpacio, a generous serving that looked like an exquisite marble pattern. It was tender and beautifully complemented by the pickled eggplant. Braised artichokes were the ultimate comfort food. I loved the little tang that came with it, which offset the richness of the parmesan. Hubby ordered Agnolotti with lamb neck. It was full of flavor and the pasta had a lovely, pillowy texture. My Pappardelle with duck ragu was insane. There were so many levels of flavor, I lost count. The shaved foie gras on top carried it over to the other side! Sauce was silky; I ended up sopping every last bit with a piece of bread. The wines by the glass (we had the Vermentino, followed by Chianti) were very good. Next time we'll try dessert if we can save some room. I want to note how good the service was.

The atmosphere is so intimate but with fun music and vibes. We instantly became friends with the manager when we met her at the hostess stand and she bought us our first round of drinks. We sat at the bar until our reservation and the drinks were amazing. The bartender was so friendly as well. Once we were sat we enjoyed an amazing meal. The focaccia and polenta tortellini apps were the best part! This will be a staple whenever my mom visits me in the city now.

I hate to leave a review like this during this tough time for restaurants but I'm not going to holdback when a restaurant exhibits such RACIST behavior.  It needs to stop. This happens to people of color all too often at trendy restaurants and they need to be held accountable.  Long story short, we told the host we didn't want the worst table facing a busy 6th ave street and we would be willing to wait for a two-top table closer to the restaurant.  The nicest two-top table opened up and it was given to another couple (white) that walked in after us.  We asked the host why we couldn't have that table and he reverted with the most condescending answer. We didn't designate that table so it went to someone else. Wouldn't it make sense to give it to the people that were waiting 30 mins for their reservations (next in line)?  Anyways, this happens all the time. White privilege wins again.

Jackie W.,/user_details?userid=fR2o90CBcb5s9PE8pJfGYA,"New York, NY",12/9/2022,4.0,This was my first time trying Albanian food! I was happy to try out so many different things. My friends and I tried a collection of different foods. My favorite was probably the mantia which are like little pan fried dumplings. These were sooo good! We also had the Mixed Grill Platter which featured the sausages and other different meats. It was all seasoned really well. The table also came with complimentary bread that was so fluffy and delicious. We also got the sausage teva which was sausage in a cheesy sauce - great to dip in the bread. The waitress seemed like she didn't really want to be there haha but she warmed up when we asked how to pronounce the restaurant name and the meaning. The ambiance was amazing and cozy! We were in the back room and it felt like we were having dinner in a nice home. I'm glad I got to try this place!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/%C3%A7ka-ka-q%C3%ABllu-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The food itself is fine (not great), however - what made our experience truly dreadful was the insect infestation and the staff response (see video for first round).  The service was very slow to start, so we went ahead and ordered our entire meal at the same time, which was unfortunate, considering ten minutes in we saw a giant roach. When the staff was alerted, we were welcomed with a ""welcome to New York"". We then saw two more in steady succession.

It turned out to be a truly great culinary experience from start to finish, and one that actually filled us up a lot more than other omakase restaurants we have visited. The price point is also on the more affordable side: $120 per person. We added a toro trio tasting and, of course, some sake. The head chef, Masaya Shirai, clearly cares deeply about his craft and excels at it. He is mesmerizing to watch in action and comes across as a very kind and friendly person (funny as well). We enjoyed talking with him and tasting the fruits of his labor! The omakase itself is a nice mix of nigiri and other dishes (both hot and cold), and each course is thoughtfully prepared and beautifully presented. My favorites were the toro tasting and the sea scallop. At the end of the meal, they brought out their seasonal sorbet selection and wrote a cute anniversary message on the plate, which was a nice touch.

We order 3 things for the table: the duck salad, vegetable fried rice, and the short ribs. All were amazing and packed with flavor. The kale in the salad is kept crispy, I have no idea how they do that but it's such a great pairing with the duck. The vegetable fried rice may *sound* plain, but it definitely isn't. It's super fragrant and is the perfect carb-y dish to go with any of the mains! The short rib sat on a creamy coconut curry sauce and came with a small side of crispy rice on the plate. The short rib was insanely tender and the meat fell right off the bone.

Arlene W.,/user_details?userid=LrLRacy1XKJcWn7TbAKyWA,"Manhattan, NY",12/22/2022,5.0,"When I saw that Erika Chou, owner of Wayla and Kimika, was opening a Thai restaurant, I had to make a reservation! It claims to be ""Old-Phuket style,"" blending local Thai and immigrant Chinese cooking, which resulted in delicious flavors I had never had before. The restaurant has a cozy upscale vibe, with gorgeous art deco chandeliers and velvet pillowed seating. We ordered the marinated spare ribs, duck salad, crab curry noodles, and wagyu thin rice noodles. All the dishes had complex, well-balanced flavors, but were on the smaller portion and pricier side. The crab curry was so rich and tasty, but much spicier than I expected - it was a masochistic experience where I was crying but couldn't stop myself from taking more bites. The coconut rice pudding was a refreshing dessert to finish off the meal.

For starters we got the Moo tod nam pla (pork belly), taw hu tod (fried tofu), and ped krob salad (crispy duck salad). Just wow...you can't fail with any of these. Pork belly is obvs a no-brainer, the fried tofu was coated with almost a mochi-like exterior which was very unique and worked so well, and whoever thought to add crispy kale chips in that duck salad is a genius. The Guay tiew nua (wagyu beef noodle soup) had some of the tenderest slices of beef I've ever had, and the broth was just divine.

The tofu had a sticky/gooey quality to it which was pretty cool, though I think the peanut sauce could have been a little more flavorful or maybe I just needed more of it in general. The ribs were really great, sitting in a delicious sauce, and actually fairly easy to eat, tender and not too many bones. The crispy pork belly was good but I was expecting bigger pieces. On the other hand, the small pieces allowed for more chili sauce to pork belly bite ratio which was worthwhile. Finally we had the noodles with roast chicken, which I was hesitant about since I rarely order chicken dishes at restaurants, but the chicken skin here was so crispy and good, and the rest of the flavors and vegetables in the noodles were quite good together.

Keeley G.,/user_details?userid=SVTH55FF5eXW4n_TBF39Ow,"New York, NY",1/31/2023,4.0,"The house of the red Pearl is meant to be a speakeasy within the Tin building. Located on the second floor through the mercantile shop, you go through a curtain on the back left to a dimly lit entryway that open up to a beautiful bar area. The main dining room has globe lights on the ceiling that resemble peeled lychees. The tables are predominately round booths that can comfortably seat up to 6 people. There are stylish touches everywhere, from the cut of the red menus to the matching outfits of the wait staff. They do have a cocktail list but we chose to try the sodas- I recommend the patriot chili soda. Our table of 4 overprder a bit but we wanted to try many of the dishes. The spare ribs were phenomenal. The meat basically melted off the bone in my mouth. The sauce that comes with the cabbage and shrimp rolls is rather spicy so just be aware. The main dish section is meat heavy so I recommend adding a green (we added the pea shoots but the cucumbers would've worked). The monkfish was probably the best dish on the menu. I don't see it often and it was beautifully done. I believe it was lightly breaded and mixed in with bok choy. The chili chicken was predominately chilis. We've encountered this every time we've ordered a similar dish. I would say it's a dish I recommend  anywhere. Each person is given their ow bowl of white rice with the main dishes. We opted for the fortune cookie desert and it was not at all what I expected. It has a fudge base, and then a layer of orange meringue, as well as vanilla ice cream and finally the giant cookie. There was one other gelatin like ingredient to it that I can't name. It was very fun but not my favorite. Overall you cannot discount the aesthetic. I'd recommend for a date night.

The steamed sea bass was so tender and delicate, the ma la chicken was so fresh and crispy, the monkfish with bok-choy was so zesty and smoky, the lamb with cumin was so wonderfully layered & textured... And the heavenly broth on the lobster noodles was beyond superb... Sichuan is my second favorite cuisine (ISAN THAI FTW), and over the years I have had hundreds of lunches & dinners at 'authentic' restaurants in Flushing Chinatown and Manhattan Chinatown and Brooklyn Chinatown, and I am being very honest when I say that this is EXCELLENT cooking. Is it authentic? Ish. It's influenced, but most importantly, it's INSPIRED. This is actually beautifully cooked food, with respectful nods toward the originals but it is in no way ""watered down.""

The reason why I gave it 4 stars is the food falls off a little bit. Pretty unique flavors that taste on the healthier side. The bacon fried rice was a bit of the let down with all the Brussels sprouts and there flavor over powered the huge chunks of pork.

The menu is all small plates, so it's a fun spot for a date and an even more fun spot to dine with a group. Then you get to try more! The restaurant is lively, making it a fun spot for a weekend night. Our waiter was incredibly kind, guiding us through the menu and checking in between dishes. The drinks were served in giant adult Capri sun pouches with a light on the bottom, which amused us to no end. On top of the silly but cute presentation, the drinks were great! I recommend the pure strawberry and the mojito. But the stars of the night were there dishes, specifically the cauliflower, oxtail spring roll, Berkshire rib, and noodle dishes. I would also recommend the sweet plantain and and crudo. The beet tostada was good, but I'd be fine skipping it, and the pink lady apple was the least favorite of the bunch.

Each of those dishes were so flavorful and tasty it was like an explosion of goodness in my mouth with each bite. The corn dumplings were incredibly unique in their flavor profile, it is hard to describe. The sauce was slightly sour and balanced well with the starchy flavor of the corn filling inside the dumpling. The pork jowl was so soft, it practically melted in your mouth, and was incredibly well seasoned. The lobster roll was my personal favorite as the bread was so soft and the lobster was perfectly cooked with a wonderful sauce to top it off. The other items we ordered were definitely not as good as the first three. The plantain katsu was boring compare to those other dishes and it just didn't have as much flavor. The pistachio sauce definitely helped with the flavor but overall it was not as good. The oxtail spring rolls were fairly average and the sauce didn't add much flavoring to it. The meat was very soft and cooked well but it lacked seasoning in my opinion. My least favorite item was the gumbo as I just didn't liked the seasoning and it tasted the most generic to me. I enjoyed the pop rocks dessert though as the ice cream wasn't too sweet but had a thick texture that paired well with the fun pop rocks.

Maggie C.,/user_details?userid=AA723geS4ytI2G50MP-W5w,"Flushing, NY",5/21/2021,3.0,"Sort of disappointed :( My table ordered one of everything (except for the fish) and we only really enjoyed the pork jowl (absolutely delicious!). The other dishes were alright in our opinion. Cauliflower was drenched in the sauce (way too strong), steak had no sear, the rice with octopus was super salty and we couldn't finish it, etc. Portion sizes were really small for the price. Also I didn't like how there was such a long waiting period between getting served each dish - for a while we thought we were finished with our food since nothing came for ~15 mins but then 4 plates suddenly made their way through, so I wish they could've all been served at the same time/with not that long of a waiting period. The indoor seating area was also very hot and the water they served had no ice lol. Also, we had a birthday cake and they said it was $3/pp for the cake fee but when they took it out they didn't provide us with plates, forks, or cut it (which is usually the standard if you're paying the cake fee?) In the end I don't believe they charged us but I feel like if you're not ""serving"" the cake then $3/pp as a cake fee (esp for a large party) seems a bit much for simply keeping it in the fridge. Other than the food and service, the waiters were very nice and the drinks were good! For 6 people we spent $400 including tax and tip - so like $67 per person :( Not worth especially when everyone was still hungry in the end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mokyo-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nikil P.,/user_details?userid=9S08ulikU3MuTtDsYvausg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/15/2020,4.0,Excellent neighborhood restaurant with a wide variety of options. The corn dumplings and the Taiwanese noodles were standout dishes followed by a perfectly cooked hanger steak and duck fried rice. The lamb and chicken both have potential but were unremarkable. Sally the waitress and David the manager split duties bring out dishes and explaining them in great detail.

Yosef K.,/user_details?userid=j6WkuOlI7xuA1zL3a0Ndhw,"New York, NY",2/13/2020,3.0,"Was very excited to try this is new sister restaurant of Thursday Kitchen in East Village with my friends however sadly it didn't live up to the hype. One of us got there early to put our name down and the host said 45 min and logged us in on his ipad. Which was interesting because there were tables open. Then once we all arrived we checked back with the host again and we saw his ipad just had our name and a timer next to it showing how much time our of 45 min its been. So we were waiting for an ipad timer instead of which tables we're clearing up. We were sat at a table that we'd been starring at since we walked in that was free the entire time. The menu was great and the idea of small korean tapas is fun but I don't recommend going there with a big appetite. We had 9 plates between the 3 of us and were still hungry. The plates we're delicious though... Some of our favorites were steak, duck rice, and dumplings.

The tacos were amazing and ::whispers:: you are definitely getting MORE than what you pay for.

Dominique B.,/user_details?userid=RrwxdIcB9R93pAkIISa-dQ,"Manhattan, NY",2/12/2023,5.0,"Casa Nono is a Mexican restaurant in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. It is from the same owners of Osteria Brooklyn nearby. The vibe is casual and the food is traditional with a modern twist. The staff was friendly and attentive. We started off with complimentary mini quesadillas served with their homemade salsa trio. It was a good start to a tasty meal. Casa Nono's drink menu consists of special reserve tequila, margaritas, beer, cocktails, mezcalitas, red, white and sparkling wine. The mezcalita de pina with 30 Banhez mezcal, grilled pineapple, jalapeño, cilantro, fresh lime served in a pineapple for two caught my attention. It's the sole alcoholic drink we ordered. I'm not usually a fan of mezcal, but this was palatable. We tried their traditional guacamole made with habanero salsa, avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro,  and serrano peppers. It was creamy with the perfect spice kick. We also had the camarones tiradito ceviche to start with shrimp, sesame salsa , avocado cilantro, basil, served with a corn tostada. It was very fresh and flavorful. Casa Nono has several taco options. We tried the birria with four hour braised chuck roasted beef, marinated onion, served with consumé, the chorizo and the pescado taco baja style with crispy cod fish, spicy jicama slaw, and guacamole. All of the tacos were delicious and I definitely recommend ordering them if you go here. We also tried their burrito. I believe it was pork inside of it. Everything was flavorful and filling. Next up, we had the paella nono with red mexican rice, shrimp, mussels, clams, chorizo, chicken, and sweet green peas. It was not the best paella I ever had, but was delicious nonetheless. We all really enjoyed it. For dessert we ended with the tres leches cake and coconut cake. Both were really good. I preferred the tres leches, but the coconut cake was moist (hate that word) and exceeded my expectations. I recommend trying both of them. Overall, this is a great restaurant to gather with friends over drinks and delicious Mexican eats. Definitely check it out if you're in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/casa-nono-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

In the past,  fancy seafood is typically served alongside some smug attitude- but not at El Pinguino! This quaint bar serves excellent seafood like their mango ceviche (insanely delicious) and oysters (the one's we had from Canada were incredible) alongside perfectly made martinis (don't sleep on that happy hour from 4-7!). The staff here is extremely helpful and friendly and we made fast friends with Euan and Michael, both of whom had excellent suggestions and made our experience even that much more enjoyable. Perfect for a date night or just a night out with a friend, El Pinguino is the best way to start out your night, end it or just stay way too long and get very drunk on the sheer bliss of this place.

We were not disappointed. Starter was salad w miso dressing and an injera type roti bread; it was light and delicious. Then we had a fresh baked sour dough with fresh soft in house made sea salt butter (Amazing). For dinner we had the tile fish and beef shoulder, both delectable and full of flavor. Tried the wizard's comb cocktail and loved it. At dessert we shared the passion biscuit and chocolate situation. Both were wonderful. So for $65 prix fixe it's a deal.

I'm so happy that I made the time to come here and try a lot of great food. Went to the back garden where they do their a la carte menu as opposed to the prix fixe within the main restaurant where you can see the kitchen. The service was impeccable as everyone was greeting me and all the staff was super friendly. We ended up eating with a chef of the restaurant as someone in our party knew her, so that was cool to get a glimpse into Oxalis' style and learn more about what we were eating. We ended up ordered... everything on the menu! My highlights were certainly the sourdough bread (which it seems like everyone and their mother is talking about); that butter was special!! But more than that, I loved the tomato spread with the rosemary lavender bread; I could have eaten that all up! I think the mushroom kebab (which just isn't a kebab at all) fell a bit flat, but still - all in all, this was a SPECIAL meal. The buttermilk dessert + the peach tart really rounded it all out. And my orange wine cocktail was delicious and served in the perfect glass. I know they have a more rotating menu here, so I'd love to come back sooner rather than later to try some great food. It came out to a bit less than $100/person, so considering it is a 1 Michelin-star place and we got everything on the menu, I think that's great; each dish isn't quite expensive so you can come in for a drink and some food and not break the budget.

Luckily as we were considering whether we should stay or not (not saying their a la carte wasn't appealing but mom wanted the big welcome for the new son-in-law), the general manager, Adrienne. stepped in and informed us someone cancelled. We were very lucky. (They usually have a set amount of ingredients and courses set for reservations so if you don't have reservations, from what I was told, they don't squeeze people in.)

John H.,/user_details?userid=7IHabO5YEGuBOeNMXFrOwA,"Midtown East, New York, NY",8/7/2022,1.0,"I went to Brooklyn with my partner to see an exhibit at the Museum and came across Oxalis. I have to echo the same sentiment that the service was poor / hosts were rude and incompetent. F+ at best. I called ahead of time (5:09 pm) to confirm if walk-ins were available for the tasting menu--which I was told yes. After stopping by in person, my partner and I were told we would wait 25-30 minutes at most and would receive a call. An hour and a half later I called again to see where I was in the queue and was told I'm next in line (7:30 pm). So my partner and I walked to a nearby bar to get a drink and chat. At this point (8:15 pm), we made a quick reservation for a 9:00pm slot (under the belief we would get an option for the tasting menu like promised) and walked over at 8:45 pm and spoke to the hosts. My partner and I were surprised by the passive aggressiveness and catty comments from the staff, and were told if we canceled we would be charged. Despite what we were promised verbally when we initially called 3.5 hours ago! We decided to take our business elsewhere. For how ""upscale"" this establishment is portraying itself to be I am surprised by the rudeness and lack of empathy my partner and I experienced interacting with this business / staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxalis-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They have a prefix tasting menu but they are very flexible with food allergy accommodations. I came when I was pregnant and there were several items on the menu that I could not eat. Our waiter communicated efficiently with the chef and was able to accommodate every one of my wishes. It is a pretty big spacious space inside. It is great for an intimate date or a night out with girls. I had brunch there and it was delicious as well. They have a big outdoor space that I can't wait to try in the summer.

You walk in the door and the kitchen is right there. Open and inviting. Smells of the amazing good greet you. A cook says hello and asked for our name. Even though there are hosts it was a nice way to be welcomed. We are led to our table. Every member of the friendly staff saying hello. Now let's get down to the main event. The drinks and meal! Every dish was heaven. The sourdough (fresh and warm with fresh butter.) Jambon! Totally different then plain old ham or prosciutto. The tuna carpaccio. Wow. Balanced and light. Sweet potatoes (lovely and light.) Next was the trout. This was the star of the show! I could eat this dish every minute of every day. And the beef was fantastic too.

This restaurant is more American rather than French based on the food we had. If you're looking for French food this is not the place. I felt the quality of the food was very fresh and dishes were unique and creative. I love the open kitchen as you walk in. I would've preferred to see the regular menu however our meal started promptly when our party arrived. I didn't realize we had an option to try other items on their menu until we were done with our meal. This was not necessarily the restaurants fault but rather me not asking as I was content with the meal that was previously arranged by my party. I was curious as we left the restaurant what else we could've tried while we were there but did not get a chance to try. If you have a big appetite this prefix dinner would not have been enough to fill you up.

Christin M.,/user_details?userid=383fieseMn4s6pHoNY7ugQ,"Baltimore, MD",5/20/2019,5.0,"Highly recommended for an adult evening out, special date night, or an occasion to celebrate. You'll enjoy an excellent meal, carefully crafted and conceptualized, from start to finish. I'd also suggest, if you're a duo, that you request the table with front row seats of the kitchen and the chef at work. I thoroughly enjoyed the added bonus of a show and it was really neat to see the composition and plating of each dish making its way to us. Oxalis offers a prix fixe dinner service (offerings change nightly) with optional wine pairing at an additional cost. My spouse and I elected to go all in and we loved the complete experience of everything being expertly selected for us - what a fun and delicious treat! We also relished in being surprised with the menu offerings for the evening when we sat at our places (hidden but neatly placed under our napkin and bread plate). Don't be afraid to ask questions - the staff, even the chef, are very friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes, the creative ingredients as well as the wine pairings. I was also shocked by my favorite course of the evening; glancing at the menu I knew I was looking forward to the soft shell crab and while everything was excellent, I was absolutely blown away by the potato, ramp, and kombu spring stew. It was so unexpected for me, I loved every bite. Both flavor and texture variety were perfect. That said, be open to being pleasantly surprised.

Literally, each bite, I closed my eyes to experience the incredible blend of flavors. We had two more appetizers that were equally fantastic. We also did the wine pairing which had perfect choices for all the courses. I added caviar to the fluke, which was outstanding. The beef with walnut miso, and black garlic melted in my mouth with the greatest flavors. Three different desserts put this evening over the top. Chef Nico and the phenomenal staff made us feel so welcome. Chef Nico, you truly love what you do and it shows in your creative food ideas, presentations and phenomenal food. This Michelin star restaurant is a real gem. Bravo, Nico and we will return!

This restaurant works perfectly for the part of Brooklyn it's in, which you kind of feel before you even open the door. The quality of the dishes the Oxalis team serve will astound you and are worth every dollar. They do rotating tasting menus, but also offer food and drink off an ala carte menu in the back half of the restaurant. You can tell that Nico and Co. know what they are doing, and also, most importantly, that they care. Being able to watch the chefs and cooks working so diligently in the open kitchen is quite humbling, but also inspiring. I think we could all learn a thing or two about delicious, fresh, new ways of approaching food and it'll be fun to see it happen here. Aspiring chefs, foodies, and regular people of all walks of life, in and out of Brooklyn, should give Oxalis a try. Maybe you'll learn something new, see something great, or just enjoy a nicely prepped and prepared meal, served to you by their nice staff.

The service was fantastic as was the atmosphere. I have a ton of food allergies to raw whole fruits and vegetables (I know, my life sucks) and they were so accommodating and created two entirely different dishes for me (though what my family ate for those courses was apparently also fantastic). To top it all off, the dessert (goat milk with honey and thyme - trust me, totally different than what you're probably imagining right now) was perhaps the best dessert I've had in my life and I've come to to the realization that was the peak of my dessert journey and I'm fine with that.

Java Indonesian restaurant in Brooklyn was like a homecoming for me. We ordered ""ayam goreng"" or fried chicken, beef rendang and chicken satay. The ""ayam goreng"" was a crispy chicken breast that came in a rich sauce of kecap manis (dark, sweet soy sauce) over a bed of lettuce. The beef rendang was incredibly flavorful - I could easily taste the lemongrass and spices. It was stewed perfectly with fall-apart beef cubes in a coconut milk based sauce. The rice was perfect to soak up to juices from the rendang and the fried chicken. The chicken satay was tender and absolutely covered in a savory peanut sauce. I also recommend asking for a side of homemade sambal and kecap manis to dip your goodies into.

You start off with a flavorful soup, 2 salad appetizers and a corn fritter. It was amazing and flavorful. Then comes the heated tray with satays, fish, shrimp, vegetables, chicken, and beef. All delicious but the beef was a bit tough. The pandan pudding was delicious and refreshing to end with along with the jasmine tea.

The Jakarta delight drink was amazing, def a must order. The restaurant is a little small and we had a group of 4 bigger guys, we did feel a little tight sitting down by the door. When another group left we moved to a more spacious table so all good there. The waitress was very friendly but communicating with her did feel a bit difficult at times. After ordering our food we did not feel confident that we would actually get the items we ordered as we weren't sure what the waitress was saying half the time. To our surprise, we received all our food and drinks and they were correct. If this is your first time with Indonesian food than I'd definitely say give this place a shot.

Service was really good! We asked for recommendations since we had never really had Indonesian food before and were only sharing 2 dishes among the 3 of us. We got the mie goreng and the daging belado. The mie goreng was really good - there's slices of fried garlic and onion which add so much flavor to the dish. The daging belado flavorwise was great, however the beef chunks were so hard to chew. I literally chewed a piece of beef 50 times and it still wasn't broken down completely.

Sarah S.,/user_details?userid=PH02kJ4nz7DuHJSR9JcrzQ,"Rochester, NY",7/11/2018,4.0,"Being Indonesian, I am well aware of the deliciousness that is Indonesian food. That being said, I am a little biased. However, I know many non-Indonesians who will agree that Indonesian food is mind-blowing. I was struck by how few Indo restaurants there are in NYC, and after my favorite one closed down, we decided to come here. We came in at about 9pm on a Saturday night, and we were the only ones in the place. I knew it was the real deal when I saw traditional Indonesian art on the walls, along with traditional music playing in the background. Even the seating is in an almost communal style, with individual seat cushions that give the place a very cozy, home-like feeling. We were promptly greeted by our waiter. For a beverage, we ordered the Garuda, which was incredibly fresh, fruity, and delicious. I could be mistaken, but I do not believe I saw any alcohol on the menu--this is very typical of many Indonesian restaurants, as majority of the population is Muslim and alcohol is forbidden. Regardless, the meal was still an incredible experience. Of course we had to get the $50 Rijstaffel, which comes with 15 different small dishes. I wanted my boyfriend to be able to try a variety of different foods, so this was a good choice. It started light, with Soto Ayam, which is a flavorful soup filled with chicken (ayam), scallions, and more. After this came the corn fritters, veggies in a tangy, vinegar-y sauce, satay, and fried veggies in peanut sauce. Then came the large platter which contained the rest of the meat dishes. What is great about Indonesian food is how they combine a variety of sweet, island, coconut flavors with savory and salty flavors such as peanut sauce. Then some dishes are more tangy. Your palate will always be guessing, and it will always be satisfied. My favorite dish was the Kari Ayam (chicken curry), which was thick, rich, and had a plentiful amount of potatoes. I'm getting hungry right now just thinking about it. The one thing I would change is the rendang--traditionally, it is supposed to be slow cooked for hours to the point where it is very tender and almost falls apart--this rendang was a bit too chewy. Other than this, every thing was perfect. The dessert is fantastic as well. The food was well worth $50, and I would definitely come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/java-indonesian-restaurant-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The gado-gado hit the spot, with a good mix of tofu and boiled veggies under a sweet peanut sauce. Chicken & beef we're over cooked and stringy but the flavors were good, although toned way down from authentic Indonesian cuisine. The fried shrimp was a surprise hit, shrimps were fried perfectly and seasoned just right as well. Omelet was unlike anything I've had in Indonesia but still delicious, although over salty.

As starters, get the fried calamari and one of the exotic drinks from the menu, you won't be disappointed. I got the 15 dishes for two. They start you off with a soup and to be honest, it wasn't that great. The lamb and the chicken were pretty good, I thought the soy sauce tasted a bit like chocolate sauce for some reason. They also had shrimp and I didn't enjoy that too much. Some dishes were sweet, some were mild, nothing was really too spicy. The waiter was very nice and he was very honest.

My favorite dish was the Udang Tumis which is sauteed shrimp with mushrooms in Java's sauce. The brown Java sauce is deliciously sweet and savory.  You could put it over any meat and rice.  It's lick the plate good.  We also tried the fried chicken.  I wasn't a fan.  The flavor wasn't all that and it came out a little dry.  And we also tried the Mie Goreng. That was quite good.  It's like a cross between filipino pancit canton and chinese take out lo mein.  The rijstaffel also included tea for everyone and dessert. That night it was a green coconut custard like dessert. Texture wise it was somewhere near a custard with the firmness of a jello.  It reminded me of haupia that we got while in Hawaii.  Overall I was satisfied with the meal.  The bathroom was nice and clean and had funny art work.  The place, though dark, was small but cozy.  We lucked out on being the only party for the night so the staff was available whenever we needed them.  I would go back there again if a friend wanted to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/java-indonesian-restaurant-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Service was great, and the uber cute restaurant made a great dining experience. I love how it's dark inside, and how they place candles and a stem of rose on each table. Kinda romantic, but I don't come here for a romantic experience. I come to experience food from Indonesia, where I used to reside for 16 years! What I have noticed about JIR is how some of their meat were previously frozen so it sometimes has that frozen taste to it.

Simran K.,/user_details?userid=ZlPUSshE4Yh1r66ABM81Vw,"New York, NY",7/1/2021,4.0,"Barolo was a great spot for fine Italian cuisine and is relatively more on the $$$ end from a price point. I absolutely loved their wine collection and the  entree I ordered which was a Fresh Filet of Sea Bass, Lemon, Capers & White Wine. Since I went with a big group, we did order multiple courses all the way from two apps, to an individual entree and two desserts along with bottle(s)of wine. So maybe I'll visit next only for an occasion for which I'm willing to dish out a good chunk of dollar bills for a refined, Italian plate of goodness! Also, a special shout-out to their complimentary bread served at the beginning which was also some of the best I've had around here. I would absolutely recommend this spot to someone looking for a ""fine"" grade Italian meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-east-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were a group of six and for starters we ordered the melon & prosciutto, calamari, burrata, octopus, and mussels. My favorites were the calamari and the mussels. The burrata was underwhelming and I was expecting the grilled octopus however it was very thin slivers of octopus with a really good arugula salad. For the main course we all got fish, either the branzino, salmon and the sole. I really enjoyed the branzino, it was cooked perfectly with crispy skin and seasoned well.  For the dessert we ordered the molten chocolate cake and a sponge cake.

Chris B.,/user_details?userid=sOG9cB6L9-sxy2SeMy4ekQ,"Manhattan, NY",7/7/2020,4.0,"Went here for the first time last night on a drinks date. It was a spur of the moment decision to go there instead of 2nd avenue, as we walked by it was an obvious choice given how nice it looked on the street, white tablecloth and flowers outdoors by the tables. So much cleaner and nice than all the 2nd ave bar options and wine bars, and better spacing. The food is really what brought me to write a review though, we only had 1 appetizer to share with drinks but the Burrata we had was incredible! It was also served with bread and their signature side of some sort of magical crushed tomato sauce for dipping which I'll be craving until I go back. 4 Stars for my experience with drinks outside, but if I go back to eat and everything else is good I'll consider 5 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-east-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Burrata was good but the salad was way too sour! For the entrees, I had the branzino and my friend had the chicken. The fish was dry and it wasn't cleaned properly (see pics for scales and a small bone). You can imagine how unsettling that was. Chicken had a strange taste that I can't quite place my finger on.

Miss A.,/user_details?userid=saeoZW_9WRW26lCK31dkbw,"Fogelsville, PA",8/10/2019,2.0,"I'm giving this place 2 stars because my meal was good. My husband's meal was horrendous however. I had the spinach ravioli with pink sauce from the dinner menu. There was a spinach ravioli on the regular menu with red sauce but this one had pink sauce and came with a salad and dessert and price was very good. I enjoyed it. Salad was fresh. I gave the dessert to my husband which was a Caramel ice cream of some sort. He said it was just ok. He ordered the special - Fresh Cavatelli pasta with filet mignon and a glob of ricotta on top in a marinara sauce. I also tasted it and agreed it was almost inedible. The supposed filet mignon tasted bad and I would've guessed that it was not beef or it was just bad meat. We didn't complain because we didn't have time to wait for another meal as we had to get to the Queen concert -my husband ended up just eating the cavatelli which also was not good. Flavorless and way too under-cooked. Cavatelli should be al dente but this was very under-cooked. Nevertheless, he was starving so he ate it. The atmosphere was very cozy and I ordered a California Cabernet which was delicious. The waiter rattled off the specials with a very strong accent and we couldn't understand hardly anything. If you're gonna have waiters with thick accents, then they should hand out a specials menu to read along. The owner walks around asking if everything is ok which is very professional however not a smile and very creepy. I even tried to get him to smile by smiling at him and he made me feel so uncomfortable. Very weird. The waiter smiled but was a bit rude when I asked a question. It's like they are robots and If you ask them to stray from their script, they get annoyed. Just didn't get a comfy welcome vibe from the staff. My guess is they are trying to come off as very elite and professional but instead they are coming off rude, stiff and robotic. I see others have reviews saying similar things. I wouldn't go back because of this. Even though my meal was good and price was decent. The fact that my husband's meal was bordering on inedible and the steak didn't taste like steak and the staff was so unfriendly makes me not want to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/barolo-east-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was even better off the grill! We got one of the combos and tried multiple cuts of meat. The food was good and the ambiance was fun for the group.

Waiter told us a party of 3 that we needed to order the barbeque for dinner.  This is the first time that we decided to just order the soup/and stew along with bulgogi japchae and 2 appetizers plus a bottle of soju. Waiter forgot about our soju and we had to remind him. Previous visits we always order korean bbq.  When the bill came a 20% percent gratuity was added on already so our bill.came to 140.00.  When I ask isn't it customary for party of 5 or more to add in gratuity and was told new policy in place 2 months ago to auto add it.  Just wondering has it happen to anyone else?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/gunbae-tribeca-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We tried a family style starting with the combo of Mini seafood pancake, fried dumplings veg. and pork served,  my guest loved the pork, the vegetable was chopped very fine and mushy inside,  gunbae wings were good, but our third order was just greasy lacking flavor, yes i said third order, you only get 5 for $9.00. Then we ordered the delicious Wagyu Kalbi for $41.00, small portions were disappointing. Then we added lamb chops, tiger shrimp needed zest, and for 3 to 4 we ventured to try the han sang combo, which includes Wagyu Kalbi, Yang-Nyum Kalbi, Bulgogi, Samgyup Pork Belly, Kale & Tofu Salad, Fried Dumplings, Banchans, Egg Hotpot, Lettuce, onions for 135.00. It sounds like a lot but not. I tried the spicy margarita which was great. The experience was wonderful with food grilled quickly before your eyes. The food lacks some flavor, and the portions are small. Family style was a great way to get to try it all. Karaoke was a blast with a two hour room rental, it goes by fast. $120. Pr hour.

I would've done Korean BBQ if I wasn't by myself, but I saw what other people ordered and it all looked great - can't wait to return and try it when life returns to normal.  The waitress was patient as she explained the difference between the different kinds of sake - can't recall which one I had specifically, but I enjoyed it. Since the pandemic, I've been trying to continue to support Gunbae. I've ordered the bulgogi bibimpop, Hite, Kloud, and the mini kimchi pancake for delivery.  The order was correct, arrived on time and was pleasantly surprised it came with all these extras. I'll definitely continue to support them and hope to go there in person when this is all over.  There happened to be a bridal shower in the karaoke rooms downstairs when I was there in-person and the party sounded like they were having a really good time and they all looked really happy as they left.

Nanciee N.,/user_details?userid=CSPixjKRnW7dUgi2i4cvTw,"Brooklyn, NY",12/31/2017,4.0,"Pretty decent experience here. I came with my cousins because we wanted to eat Korean food. The prices are average for the area, so not too bad. After ordering, the waitress/waiter would bring in the little side dishes. Those were good appetizers. The portion for what we had ordered looked small, but it was actually really filling near half way through the meal! We left being full. There were staff in the restaurant but I felt service was lacking the day we went. I guess it was because they had delivery stock coming in and the items blocked the passageway, making it seem like no one was there to give us our check or give us a new bottle of water. For the area, this spot is pretty good.

The chicken basil entree was also a highlight. Prices are good for the area. One star off for the pad Thai. This is something I order all the time and is a basic dish every Thai restaurant should master. Maybe they were just having an off day but the pad Thai was so soggy and flavorless.

Look no further than C as in Charlie, the newest culinary hotspot in NoHo, serving Korean tapas with a southern twist. Walking in, there was disco music pumping thru the speakers and plenty of satisfied-looking patrons. The dishes that stood out to me were the fresh and delicious tuna tartare which paired well with the crispy/salty rice chips and the Seoul'sbury steak which had the sexiest glaze, oozing on to the cheesy grits. The winner for me though, was the mushroom bibimbap. The rice was perfectly fluffy and absorbed the umami flavor of the mushroom. The yolk of the poached egg acted as a glue, marrying all of these flavors and textures together, creating the perfect comfort meal. David, our server and one of the owners, was super cool and accommodating. It felt nice having that personal touch and insight on to the story of how the restaurant came about between 3 friends from Georgia . I was left satisfied and could clearly see connection between the southern comfort feel of the food and the Korean flavors. I ended it off with a misleading bagel and cream cheese with jelly, which was really icecream between a bagel shaped wafer.

Michael T.,/user_details?userid=E7tDAMhhCc7J4-F52ttjcw,"Little Neck, NY",10/11/2022,5.0,"Tried this new Korean spot in Soho New York where every item on the menu is a tapa and it was a pretty interesting experience! Let me start off by saying that the staff was extremely welcoming and made the entire experience so much better. The food was overall pretty good with the exception of the dessert. We started off with the Tuna Tartare which was very fresh and the flavors were delicious. The first entree to arrive eas the Oxbone Cream Pasta which was my favorite thing I ordered. Lots of flavor and was just overall so good. The Toast Roll was a recommendation of the staff but unfortunately it was a little disappointing. It was filled with shrimp paste and with the honey mustard sauce on the dish, overall tasted a little plain. The Mushroom Bibimbap was great too and any mushroom fan will appreciate this one. We ordered a total of 4 tapas for 2 people and it was a solid amount of food. The last thing we tried was the Charlie's Deli Bagel which was a bagel made of cone material instead of bread with sour cream yogurt and strawberry jelly filling. This one was a little disappointing in my opinion as it was a bit too tart for my liking and just didn't taste very unique although it looked pretty cool.

Not the easiest place to get a table at currently but still possible, although that may change due to recent hype from Michelin and Resy articles. This is a great restaurant with excellent service while remaining relatively affordable. We got 5 dishes total (2-3 dishes per person is recommended) and our favorites were the steak/grits, and the oxbone pasta. Everything was good though. We were given complimentary hot tea, without being prompted, due to our table which was by the entrance - we didn't feel cold at all though. It was a nice touch however. I've dined at a bunch of Michelin starred restaurants and while I am a complete food amateur I think the food and service here is better than some of the 1-starred places.

Favorite dishes were the ribs, toast roll, and mushroom bibimbap. We were three of us and we ordered everything on the menu besides the edamame hummus and two out of three of us wanted pizza after so I recommend ordering a couple of some dishes if you have a big appetite. The banana pudding was a huge skip for our group - it was super overly sweet and didn't have enough cream to balance it out, only more sweet marshmallow fluff. The servers were really nice but I sadly have to knock a star because the restaurant is so incredibly loud that I could not ever hear the server explain what the food was, and I could barely hear the people I was having dinner with which had a much bigger damper on the experience than I expected. The tables are so close together that there is no way to move around without bumping in to the back of someone's chair, and the noise makes it feel like you're in a really crowded bar trying to eat, but hey if that's your vibe then this is the place for you.

We arrived close to 10pm and we were seated on the balcony with an amazing view of the city. With upscale restaurants, the menus tend to more concise. I opted for a caesar salad with shrimp as it was cheaper than a lot of the other items and I wasn't in the mood for anything heavy. The salad alone was eighteen dollars, which is pricey, but it was delicious. One of my friends ordered the asparagus risotto and a side of herbed fries; both were phenomenal and worth visiting for those alone.

The elevator takes a while to arrive and you do have to search for it but it's an amazing find for a casual or romantic lunch,https://www.yelp.com/biz/view-of-the-world-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Sheena G.,/user_details?userid=wCbCmpsRWzKzElFK-4kZRw,"Atlanta, GA",4/6/2018,5.0,Hidden gem in financial district. Everything great from beginning to end! Waiter was super attentive and friendly the entire time. The menu is not expansive but every item on it is tempting. As a non-meat eater I still had several options to choose from on both starters and entrees. The wine offerings were also pretty good. I rarely see south african offerings and the sauvignon selection was superb! The view is absolutely amazing with a small patio to step out into when the open air rooftop is closed. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/view-of-the-world-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sandra H.,/user_details?userid=whVx_cp-ylCqM836HCrCRQ,"Pattersonville, NY",10/12/2019,3.0,"We stayed at the word center hotel and this is the rooftop restaurant. I will say the view is spectacular but the food is just okay and the waiter wasn't on point. They have a BOGO happy hour from 4-7 and applies to tables and not just the bar which is great. They also bring one drink at a time for you. We were seated at a two top and ordered drinks. I asked about the Branzini dish which was a whole fish served with two sides. Opted against it because of the bones and didn't want to work for my meal. The whole roasted chicken would be 25 minutes to cook as our waiter informed us. We ordered that with garlic bread and Swiss chars as our sides. This meal is enough for 2-3 people to share. After 10 minutes a different waiter brought a shrimp app to our table which we told him we did not order. Mistake number one. It was supposed to go outside to a table on the terrace. After 20 minutes our ( wrong ) meal was delivered. It was the whole Branzini fish!!!!! Mistake number 2!! I told the waiter we had ordered the roasted chicken!! He seemed confused and said, no you didn't! I said yes we did! I said how much longer for the chicken? He said 20 minutes! He apologized and offered a free appetizer. We ordered the fig and cheese platter. It was very good! After about 20 minutes and two drinks in, our chicken dinner was delivered. Wait! It had the wrong sides with it! Grrrrr! Mistake number 3!! Waiter proceeded to bring the right sides after another 5-10 minutes. We were starved so carved up the chicken. While it was good, it was very spicy hot!!! I have never had roasted chicken be served spicy hot before! Needless to say, everything was taken off the menu except our drinks which made our bill 14.00. Total time sat was for 3 hours!!! At 9:00 many families started to come in and seated all with little kids and babies. I would suggest going to the bar during happy hour and ordering little plates as this restaurant doesn't have it together in my opinion. Again, the View is Spectacular!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/view-of-the-world-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

On the 20th floor of the World Center Hotel, this quaint restaurant has a spectacular view of the 9/11 Memorial, One World Trade Center, and the Hudson River from its outdoor terrace - an absolutely breathtaking view of Manhattan!  And this was the cherry on top of the breakfast and dinner we had as World Center Hotel guests.  Omelettes made-to-order was a special touch to the small yet satisfying breakfast buffet.  This dinner was excellent, with a simple menu that satisfied everyone.  The burger with creamy remoulade and the wonderfully herbed pork loin were outstanding.  Special requests for each of the three pasta primaveras we ordered were happily delivered. The salads tasted as beautifully as they were plated.  The service was very upbeat all around.

The staff was great, fair drink prices and the food was pretty good. My favs were the crab cake ($15) and the 3 mozzarella pesto sliders ($11) which are on the bar menu (but you can order it at the tables).  The sliders were better than the regular burger we all felt.  The watermelon panzanella ($16) was really good but a bit pricey for what it was. Scallop poppers ($15) were okay. Of all the apps I would def go for the crab cake again, for taste and price.  My pressed chicken and Brie sandwich was a little bland, I had I ask for that burger pesto sauce on the side to give it some more flavor. The fries were amazing though! Thin and crispy, shoestring-like.  My cousin's sage pork chop ($26) was a huge portion and really juicy. My other cousin's poached salmon salad ($18) was pretty bland and a bit dry, I'd skip it. My mom's shrimp Harissa pasta was a little under seasoned as well, but the ingredient combination tasted good together with some added salt. Unfortunately you can only eat here if you're a guest of the hotel. If you do stay here, I would def recommend having your meals here, for the view, the sliders, and the crab cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/view-of-the-world-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The view and atmosphere are wonderful, especially on a beautiful night. However, the service was abysmal. For dinner, the service was lacking in attention. We had to wait long periods of time for drinks and assistance. The food was very good. Breakfast was extremely unsatisfactory. Once seated, we were told of the breakfast buffet options and then pretty much forgotten. After we returned from the buffet the first time, we found another family had been seated at our table on the veranda. The coffee we had asked for took three attempts to be served and two trips to the kitchen myself to remind the server. Then no cream or sugar and had to wait for those items. Many of the items on the buffet went unfilled throughout our meal including milk for cereal, juices, bacon and pancakes. At the end of our meal, it took so long to get the check that I left with our children back to our room while my wife stayed behind. Much of this appeared to be due to understaffing. There were only two servers on and they seemed responsible for all aspects of the restaurant. Despite the lack of timeliness and refills, the server was very personable, polite and very apologetic for the difficulties we experienced.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/view-of-the-world-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The place looked rusty and the lighting was not bad. We enjoyed all the chef's snack. For little cold, yellowtail was nice and i really enjoyed beef tartare. We also got the signature mad toast, but felt like it was a little bit underwhelming. For mad hot, we got fried buhsut (recommended by our waiter) and mandoo, both was fine and not too special. For the entree, we got the lobster, galbi, and noodles. They were decent, I did feel like there could be more lobster. We got two pate a choux for dessert, one matcha and one black sesame flavor. I wished the filling had stronger flavor.

The food was really creative and the server gave good suggestions for which course to add extras to, although it would've been good without.  The noodle dish addition was amazing, I wouldn't skip it. Each dish was unique and we were able to share among the three of us (each person chooses one dish from the 3-4 options). Kitchen and front of house worked together to plan the timing of each dish. We were so full, it was tough enjoying the dessert.

Simply put, this is one of the more outstanding meals we have had in a long long time. The menu apparently changes regularly but there a few popular items like the crazy toast that appear often and for an important reason,...it is damn good ! The menu was small and the wine list also commensurate with the menu but a few tasty and well priced NYS bottles were available and matched the cuisine nicely. Take my advice, book a table soon before this place gets even busier due to solid word of mouth, high marks by restaurant critics and accolades by the Michelin's !

You have the option to customize your choices with things like uni and caviar, and they recommend the best add ons for each dish. I love the fish-shaped amuse bouche, it comes to the table warm and with a aide of butter - could eat a ton of that! But make sure you save room for the rest. We did that with our tartare (added uni, which was so fresh and delicious). The plates are meant to be shared, so the best way to go is just to order a few things from the menu and have fun with it.

When the door opens half the restaurant is frozen cold because there isn't a curtain or entryway to help reduce cold air. We asked to be reseated because of this and were given a bit of a run around before being seated at the ""bar"" in the back - which is basically just a drink station for servers. The seats to the bar are poorly designed and u have to sit sideways to fit your feet. And there's no hooks for ur purse or coat - who designs a modern restaurant in 2021 without coat hooks?

We were seated quickly, and each server was kind and took the time to explain all dishes to us. The ambiance of this restaurant is definitely not romantic- loud rap music playing and tight seating. It has a very modern and city vibe to it, which is fine, as long as that's  what you're looking for. That aside- food was atrocious. We had the steak and lobster as our hot dishes- the only edible portion of the meal. The cold dishes were grotesque- I was afraid to eat them. Admittedly, presentation was beautiful, but good lord, the food went down bad. Both my boyfriend and myself had stomach issues all night. Crab tempura was barely a whole bite, and honestly it tasted like low quality sushi crab. The complimentary snacks served at the beginning of the tasting were also insulting. One of the snacks is a poached egg with what tasted like stale dollar store croutons thrown on top. Disgusting. Somehow, the scallion pancake was worse. The cocktail wasn't terrible. It was strong and a good portion was served. The noodle tasted like spruced up ramen noodles also bought from dollar general, and the Mad Toast costs $25 and is about the size of a dollar bill folded in half. This whole meal with tip cost nearly $300, which makes the experience that much worse.

First off, I ordered the honey cocktail and my friend ordered the yuzu one. The glasses came literally half full. Thought the serving size was odd. I had a second and it arrived full to the brim. Thanks. The amuse bouche were delicious and thoughtful. Great texture captured in those little fish. We LOVED the yellowtail starter, not too mention it's so stunning. Beef tartare was also delicious. Clam toast was literally what it was. Clams on bread. The flavor was not enhanced or masked by any other ingredients. Maybe we shouldn't have expected more? Had the noodles and the rice but unfortunately they were both incredibly under seasoned and the noodles were super oily. We both went home and ended up feeling quite sick after the meal.

Popcorn chicken was delish, can't really go wrong with popcorn chicken and I'm a sucker for Thai iced tea and it was very good. The service is good.

We also tried Thai Tea which was okay nothing too fancy. We would go back but it would not be a regular ramen spot.

Ruben D.,/user_details?userid=ml0Il2T5JW_X0GEUxDCMfQ,"Newark, NJ",2/6/2023,3.0,So i was going thru instagram and found this place. We went yesterday and it was packed. The waiter really nice and told us 30/45min but it was way quicker than that. The inside is really nice so we got sat in the wooden mural tables. Really cool and private. The thai iced tea and lemonade are pretty good. But if they had an alcohol license and serve alcohol would of been a major boost. Anyway onto the food. He started with the popcorn chicken really good only thing missing was any type of sauce to dip the chicken in. Then we got the omurice with the demi glazed sauce it was pretty good. And finally the ramen. This is why my 3 stars bc its a ramen spot and the ramen wasn't 5* worth. Missing something the broth was way too sweet missing salt and something else as well. We had the number1 and number2 ramen. The desert was delicious we had the mango mille crepe cake.

Katherine V.,/user_details?userid=Ey5KfDYwM2wexzTyyeo3EA,"Seattle, WA",2/5/2023,3.0,"I feel like it's my duty to balance out the 4.8 star rating on Google and Yelp. For this price point, there are better ramen options in the city for food taste/quality (eg. menkoi sato, ichiran, toribro), but the vibe/ambiance here is more modern/trendy (if you're more interested in that than just food); definitely some cute seating! I sat at the bar which was spacious and nice for a party of 1. I ordered combo A (white garlic shoyu ramen) and found the noodles to be overcooked and the broth to be average (no special character/body); chasu was tender but nothing special. I also ordered fried oysters as an app and thought they were a great app, but they weren't a must-try item. I saved the bao to eat later (didn't really need it but it's the same price to order the pudding and ramen so thought i'd order the set since it's a better value). I'm glad I tried the matcha pudding, but note that it's small/personal-sized and it's definitely not concentrated with high quality matcha. If you want the latter, get a soft serve from the place attached T the front! Service was good until the end - had to wait more than 10 min for my card to be run, but the staff was really friendly.

The mekelburger with an additional burger. The staff was so kind and accomedating. The staff brought out our meal and assisted us with the logistics and decisions. The mekelburger was perfectly assembled and deliscious. I love when a burger comes out perfectly sauced with mega savory yummers. The fries were so yummy made me wanna POP MY BOOTY! Speaking of popping after our mekelburger we enjoyed the cinnamon babka popper with cream cheese sauce. If only i could maintain a attractive figure and only eat this indefinitly. It was bu far superior to any donut ever.crispy creamy cinnamoney and addictive. With a nice reasonable price this was a huge highlight during my 2019 trip to NYC.

Have to say it was some of the best I have eaten. She had the GF pasta and said was fantastic! I had the pork chop- so juicy. My other daughter had the Duck which was outstanding.

Sfliny F.,/user_details?userid=eVlClXaMN9g-Tuv6iRgtaw,"Levittown, NY",11/4/2022,5.0,"Recently this month on a Saturday afternoon we came into Gatsby Landings to have a drink and appetizer before seeing a Broadway play.  We were cheerfully greeted at the door immediately and shown to a nice window table in the bar area.  Menus were provided and the bartender quickly came to take our drink orders as we looked the menu.  The restaurant has a nice classy feel inside and all of the staff were great.  The main event for the appetizers was the Crispy Calamari.  Not a crumb was remaining on the platter when we were finished.  The other appetizer ordered was the Zucchini Blossoms which was lightly breaded zucchini covered in a lightly whipped ricotta with a touch of honey, it was full of flavor.  Everything was so delicious that we decided to come back to the restaurant after the show for dinner.  Before leaving for our show, we made an evening reservation so we would know a table would be available.  When we arrived and sat at our table for dinner, the first thing we did (before looking at the dinner menu choices) was order the Crispy Calamari!  The menu items are very unique here, so don't expect this to be your typical dining experience.  For instance, I had the Spring Lasagna which was made with homemade lasagna pasta vegetarian style with a delicious creamy white pesto sauce.  The Spring Lasagna portion was just right but by the time I had my last bite I felt the fullness in my stomach.  Another dinner order from our group was the Branzino, a pan seared sea bass served with spinach and a wonderful sauce.  The food presentations on all of our dinners were top notch.  A Chef's Pasta of that day was a simple spaghetti and meatball dinner.  It was nothing simple, the homemade pasta was cooked to perfection and the fresh tomato sauce and huge meatballs were beautifully arranged in the bowl with fresh basil leaves arranged on top for decoration.  This perfectly located restaurant in the theater district is well worth a visit.  You will be greeted and served with a smile some delicious food and drinks.  We will be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gatsbys-landing-times-square-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It cost the same as the lamb chops! It cost more than literally everything on the menu except the filet mignon and porterhouse for two!! That's absurd! Food was generally mediocre, the expensive pasta with mushrooms did not have many mushrooms and didn't taste like much, lamb needed seasoning, the squash blossoms were flat fried things that sound better than they were. The decor and ambiance were very nice, and the staff attentive, but with so many good places in NYC, I'd skip this one.

The clam soup appetizer ($8) is a MUST TRY; I've never had a miso soup so flavorful and rich before. The tuna dip ($16) was tasty, but not mindblowing. We tried the signature set ($28) and an additional set of 5, with the spicy lobster ($12), avocado toast ($8), spicy crab dynamite ($8), spicy tuna ($7), and crispy salmon skin ($8).

Might have to try the burrito next time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-chilaquer%C3%ADa-new-york-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Darrell B.,/user_details?userid=V3QOXeNdpBii3Ei2MOYquQ,"Norwalk, CT",12/16/2022,3.0,"I had lunch here recently based upon the excellent reviews, sadly I came away completely unimpressed. The staff is very nice, the space is very clean and well set up, it was the food where they lost me. I got their namesake bowl for lunch. The sauce was quite tasty, but the problem was that almost all it was was tortilla chips drowned in the sauce. There was very little of the meat protein I had chosen, barely a couple of small bites in the entire bowl. I would equate it to a serving the size of a single slice of bacon, and maybe not even that.  I came away still hungry for some protein.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-chilaquer%C3%ADa-new-york-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
