Janette N.,/user_details?userid=1qcHyxzFw4ciKB76Ty5-7A,"Irvine, CA",3/3/2023,4.0,"Arguably the best udon bowl in NYC, but not the best I've had. We got the niku and ebiten udon. Personally, the niku udon did not live up to its hype. There was barely any pieces of meat in there and the broth was extremely oily, defeating the purpose of getting udon. It almost tasted like a taiwanese spicy beef noodle soup and for $20+ it was definitely not worth. The ebiten udon on the other hand was amazing. The texture of the udon noodle was so satisfying and the broth was so basic yet flavorful. I would definitely return for the ebiten but at this current price point, I'd chose marugame over raku.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Didn't realize it was cash only until we had to pay so thought I'd share the PSA. Now that that's out of the way, the food was absolutely incredible, probably some of the best udon I've ever had. Noodles were perfectly chewy and broth was rich and flavorful. Got some apps to start - fried chicken, an eggplant dish, and thick cut bacon. Thought the chicken was good, very crispy and the inside was buttery. The eggplant dish had a nice smoky flavor and was very unique! I'd skip the bacon. It was decent and honestly just a fatty pork belly, but nothing to write home about. The star of the show was of course the udon! Got the tantan. It was spicy and rich, but the broth wasn't too heavy. The noodles were super chewy which I loved! The peanuts made the broth nutty and umami. It was just so unique!!

I do agree that udon here is more chewy but I think the noddles are more flat than what I'm used to. I think I personally prefer the round noodles more since this one sorta reminds me of biang biang noodles, I'd maybe I am biased and one of my fav handmade udon spots is in downtown Los Angeles.

We went on a rainy Sunday afternoon and placed our name on the list via Yelp and the table was ready when we arrived. We were seated outside and it was super cramped and when we asked about inside seating we were scolded and told there was nothing inside and to sit. That's fine.. service alright. We ordered the spicy niku and the gyunan. The spicy niku had two pieces of tripe and some short rib for $26. The tripe was delish and I wish there were more. The flavor did not transcend beyond any dimension to me but I did like the chewiness of the noodles. The spicy oil stuck to my throat and I feel didn't balance the way I wanted to and I love spicy soups!! The gyunan was homey and comforting but both udons felt like they were missing something. For the price point I feel like I wouldn't go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The noodles were also very fresh and bouncy. But I thought this niku was on the salty side. I'm used to marugame's sweet niku broth with smaller pieces of sliced meat rather than chunks of meat. Honestly this reminded me more of Chinese braised noodles. The udon here was also skinnier/flatter. Marugame has the rounder thicker noodles that are smooth and buttery which I prefer.

Naomi W.,/user_details?userid=OyQtEmWWHeI5wEJElim12A,"Seattle, WA",2/9/2022,5.0,"I got dragged here by my SO who wanted to eat at Raku so badly. I wasn't entirely excited to go because I thought to myself - udon anywhere else aside from back home (Japan) is not that great. Wow, was I wrong. I took a sip of the broth and was surprised at the depth of flavor. It wasn't overly salty and I could taste the incredible dashi. The noodles were chewy and everything I could want in a bowl of hot soup. This review is solely for the food itself. If I had to comment on the service and place itself, I would have to say it's about 3/5 stars. If you get sat inside, be aware that you will sit really close to the other customers. We were sat outside, which we had no problems since we were trying to be cautious of our surroundings but we felt that the server(s) pretty much forgot about us. No checkbacks, but we were so content with our food that it didn't matter.

Sara Z.,/user_details?userid=BUgJjSNwnze96kyReodbvA,"Silver Spring, MD",10/27/2021,4.0,"I'm not the biggest udon fan. I'm weird and prefer soba noodles and I always compare any Japanese noodles that aren't ramen to my favorite Japantown restaurant in San Francisco (Mifune). That said, this place exceeded my expectations. My friend highly recommended this place and we were craving something warm after a chilly fall day. When we arrived, we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. It ended up being an hour and a half wait, which was not ideal but the food did arrive quickly once we were seated. I ordered something new for me, the kamaage, which is noodles with a dipping sauce. The sauce was delicious and the noodles were great - chewy but not overcooked. I also got a side of shrimp tempura which was cooked perfectly. My friends got the sansai and the niku, and both were very pleased with their orders. Also - please note that this place is cash only, but they have an ATM in the back if you need.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

One downside is they're cash only, which we only found out once we were seated - I had to go to the ATM inside the place and withdraw $240 to cover the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The vegetable tempura was good but a little bland and one of two of the vegetables were so hard to chew and break down. Otherwise the meal was great. My only gripe is how tight the restaurant is. The seats are so close to one another to the point where your sitting 1 feet away from random people. Also it was super hot in the restaurant to the point of sweating.

My only note is that we paid extra for the chili oil and I genuinely did not taste it at all -- so avoid ordering that and save yourself the charge if you want spicy! Instead would recommend getting the (free) little spice packets. Those are also not that spicy but at least it's free! The service was also amazing, our waitress was the absolute sweetest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Khanh N.,/user_details?userid=kjjivUvfP3lKJ4aeyFFJjA,"Piscataway Township, NJ",9/27/2020,4.0,A literal definition of a hidden gem. You won't be able to see it unless you really look for. We had went Pre-COVID and the seating inside was super limited. But it was a real nice experience. Their udon noodle was super flavorful. I am not sure what it is about the broth but it had complimented the udon very well. I am a texture type of gal and I loved how chewy the udon was. Every bite was mesmerizing and you can bet that I had dipped every drop of that broth. They had different varieties of items on their menu and I just felt like nothing can go wrong here except maybe how small the seatings are inside and how exceptionally crowded it could get at times.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Thomas M.,/user_details?userid=fWATWxYFBn8BcEBdHQsZKw,"Manhattan, NY",8/1/2021,5.0,"Ordered the chicken tatsuta-age to start. The chicken was extremely juicy and fried well but I was not a big fan of the sauce, which seemed like a vinegar based, mild, chipotle mayo. The pieces were fairly large and a small was definately enough for 2. For mains, we ordered the spicy niku and curry with washuyu beef. We added a poached egg and shiitake mushroom to each, and also mochi to the curry udon. The noodles came in a massive bowl, and had a decent amount of toppings. I absolutely loved the spicy niku broth, which had a lot of flavor but didn't feel too heavy. My girlfriend liked the curry broth, though I felt it was a little watery. The short ribs were tender and the honeycomb tripe added a unique texture to the dish. Both eggs were perfectly poached. The shiitake was also delicious - it's marinated/preserved in some type of sweet soy sauce and has a very firm texture - but we were a bit surprised we only received one piece each. All in, I'd be happy to return and order the Spicy Niku again with the same add-ons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Maybe I knew what to expect, or maybe I'm losing my taste buds (I should probably get covid tested) but this soup was only okay. The noodle texture and tripe were pretty good, and the pieces of beef were THICK so the chef really hooked me up with that one, but it didn't blow my mind the same way it did the first time. This venue was also much smaller and dimmer and not as delicately decorated, so if you have the chance please go to the other one for a better overall dining experience. This place was also cash only but they have this ATM machine in the back that you could use to withdraw cash. Though, I must say, the young and fun staff was definitely a plus, and they were really efficient despite nearly spilling the Niku on my friend when setting the bowl down on the table.

The workers were kind and attentive, and the food came out quickly. The ohitashi shamed my at-home wilted spinach, as it was much more flavorful and softer on the pallet than I'd previously experienced.

Callie S.,/user_details?userid=6vCVkHhqg802f4juBhRfZA,"Los Angeles, CA",6/2/2019,5.0,Definitely the best udon place in the city. The wait will be long on the weekend so plan accordingly. Get the short ribs udon or the gyunan udon (this one is with sliced shabu beef). Get the agedashi tofu for appetizers because it's the best I've had in the city. The fried chicken was just ok for me but I think it could be good for a group of people to enjoy some chicken and beers! They only serve bottled beers and sakes and no draft beers. Super small but great for udon.

Dawn Y.,/user_details?userid=_FdfOgGT846PJzasFJ0F2Q,"Kaneohe, HI",1/7/2020,2.0,"This is near the university so there were a fair number of students there, surprising because it was rather expensive. I had the cold udon with wasabi. It's a tiny hole in the wall so that is a plus for the atmosphere, but you don't feel the coziness of a hole in the wall 'good' place to hang out in. It feels cavelike in a cold anonymous way. The neutrals don't give it a sophisticated air, more like a sad underground train station kiosk.  There was a rowdy group of guys next to us...too much sake,they were very loud, but the waitress didn't seem to know how to handle them, because in the confined space of the restaurant, they were clearly annoying other guests than just us.  One knocked over a drink, the other gesticulating so wildly he swatted my friend and nearly knocked dishes from the hands of the waitress passing him a few time. And all thru the meal they were loud and vulgar, guy nearest us tossed his jacket on hitting my friend in the head. I took a star off because the space is very small which means atmosphere counts ALOT, and boorish guests make or break the experience. The waitress or owner should be able to control the space, like any respectable local pub in Japan, they maintain control over the guests as well as the food. I think the udon would have been ok, but I could hardly taste it. Compared to my experience with a udon hole in the wall in Osaka, this is definitely not as tasty, classy or pleasant.  Given the neighborhood having soo much to choose from, I would not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was kind of hard to find the restaurant but we saw some pictures on yelp and that helped us find the front of the restaurant. It's literally a hole in the wall and there's only around 7 tables inside. We went right when they opened so it wasn't packed but slowly people started arriving as we ordered. Server was really friendly and the udon was AMAZING. I got the wakame udon, niku, and the katsu-don. I liked the wakame udon the best. It tasted really fresh and the noodles were chewy as well. The niku was a bit heavy for me but it was still really good. The Katsu-don was great! It comes with a pickled vegetable that goes well with the bowl.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Julie Ying X.,/user_details?userid=52R1k6G03m8ES7N1rXiB1Q,"Brooklyn, NY",4/22/2018,5.0,I was in the area and wanted to check this place out after hearing so many good reviews.  My friend and I both ordered the curry udon (chicken and beef).  It was very flavorful and rich.  I appreciated the greens and the homemade udon noodles.  They also provide a glass of ice water since the curry was a bit spicy.  Service was fast and attentive.  I think this is my go-to place for udon instead of Tsurutontan Udon in union square.  It's more affordable ($12-$20 for a bowl of udon) and the place reminded me of the old school udon places in Japan I've been to.  I'll definitely be back if I'm ever in the area.  FYI - its cash only.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They weren't apologetic at all either, and didn't offer to take anything off the check.

And then I finally tried it. I'm just thankful I don't live near the place because I would probably eat there everyday. The noodle is what really sets Raku apart from other udon places that I've tried. It's chewy - still soft, but has more depth to it when you chew. The broth / flavor is also great (I've tried the niku, duck breast, and jaja udon) - clean, all the ingredients compliment each other very well.

It doesn't seem like the waitress there have a section to serve people bc another one came up to us to asked if we wanted to order anything to drink after we placed an order 1 minute ago. As for starter, we got the chicken tatasu. It was so crispy outside and juicy outside. It's a must get when you come here if you like chicken. For the udon, i got the niku udon. The broth was delicious and the noodle was so bouncy. My bf got the ebiten udon. He really like the fried shrimp and eggplant. I would come back here for the udon since it's freshly made.

I want to order the fried chicken next time or try the katsudon.  We got in with no problem at 4:00 pm but the place only has about 20 seats so there's potential to have a wait.  Unlike ramen which tends to overdo the ingredients, the udon is cleaner and the broth is lighter.  It is cash only but there is an ATM inside if needed.

The name of the restaurant is written only in Japanese but thankfully my fellow Yelpers posted a pic of the entrance! Let me tell you, I LOVE UDON! It is my absolute favorite food ever. I knew I had to pay this place a visit when I saw all my New York friends eating here. I had the Niku udon and it had a considerable amount of meat. I, unfortunately, was not able to finish it since my friend and I overestimated how much we could eat. For apps, we got the deep fried oysters and the chicken tatsuta-age (fried chicken). Japanese fried chicken is my second love so, of course, I had to get that. Everything was just so delicious!! We only had to wait for 30 mins for 2 people. It is a very tight cramped restaurant, very New York.

It was pretty packed around 8pm but the wait was only around 20 minutes. We ordered the fried chicken, tofu, fried oysters, and eggplants as appetizers to start. The fried chicken was juicy and tender and came with I believe spicy mayo. The tofu was soft but not really all that flavorful without the sauce. Not a fan of oysters but my friend said they were good. For the main meal my friends got the Niku udon while I got the duck breast udon. I tried the beef short ribs from my friends udon and it was tender and soft. The duck breast was good as well but I wish I had ordered the Niku udon instead.  The udon noodles themselves were probably my favorite part of the meal as they were firm and had a good chew to them.

Andrea L.,/user_details?userid=hSodx72JLu4qczjTnhNPRw,"Manhattan, NY",11/12/2019,2.0,"I'm not sure how I feel about this place honestly. I was excited to try this place due to the great reviews and I liked it but I didn't love it. I ordered the karage and pork gyoza to start. The karage was my favorite part of the meal but the pork gyoza was mediocre at best. My friends got the curry wagyu udon and I got the Niku udon since it was recommended and seemed very popular. The udon was very clean tasting and definitely what I would want if I was feeling under the weather. The udon was good; it was very silky and slipped right out of my chopsticks. Overall, it was good but didn't hit the spot like I had expected. My friends were thoroughly unimpressed by the curry udon. The wagyu beef was very dry and tasted kind of like hot pot beef and the broth was a little bit on the blander side and didn't have that curry kick they were looking for. Other than the food, my experience wasn't that greatest. The hostess was EXTREMELY rude to us. My friends got their first and put down their names before I had arrived. I mistakenly put down my name as well unknowingly and the hostess stormed out of the restaurant with the worst attitude asking us if we were the same group and then proceeded to scold us and tell us that she would now have to delete one of the reservations. It was a simple mistake and she could've told us nicely. When we entered, our server was nice so I don't want to say that the overall service was bad.  The place only accepts cash so if you do go, make sure to bring some cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It says more abt the size of the restaurant than the popularity as it could probably only fit about 25 patrons. We split the fried chicken, which was deliciously fried. I've had better and made better spicy mayo sauce though. Good thing the chicken was tasty enough without the mayo. We both got the niku udon with the tripe and beef. I've never had such silky fresh udon noodles before! Definitely worth eating in as many different broths and sides as possible. The meat was also very juicy and tender!

However, the host was very rude after my friends and I mistakenly put ourselves on the waitlist twice. We decided to give it a try anyway due to the hype and we already came all the way here. We ordered the fried chicken, gyoza, 3 curry udon w wagyu, niku udon and a bottle of sake. The only highlight was the fried chicken but It wasn't the best I ever have.

They have the best udon hands down in the manhattan area and very comparable to the udon I've had in Japan. The texture is chewy and bouncy. I've always ordered the cold udon with the dipping sauce and it does not disappoint.

I had the niku udon and my friend had the duck udon. The udon noodles are amazing and they taste handmade and very fresh. None of that processed udon that you get at other restaurants. The noodles were a bit thinner but very chewy and perfectly al dente. The short ribs and beef tripe in my noodle soup was so flavorful and just melt in your mouth. The soup was full of beef flavor but still very light. My friend also loved her duck udon but said the duck meat was a bit overcooked.

The chicken tatsu-age ($8) is ~6 pieces of marinated fried chicken packed with flavor. The pork of the katsu don ($14) was firmer than expected, which I liked. The green strip lining the pork cutlet is a seasoning typically mixed with rice, called furikake. It's unconventional and pretty, but it ultimately makes an already savory dish more savory.

My boyfriend got their popular Niku Udon (Beef tripe), the broth was so flavorful and the beef was tender and melts in your mouth. I got the Ankake Udon with a side of tempura, the Ankake broth was this thick, egg broth with a few vegetables. The flavor was way lighter than the Niku, very simple and not much special. The Udon though was so chewy and soft and it seemed as if there was an endless amount in the bowl!!

The fried chicken appetizer was also good with not a lot of fat - the dip was slightly spicy for me but seemed like it was only a spicy mayo combination. The atmosphere is tight but cute. I would say that the only two downfalls are that the soup comes out unbearably hot and takes a long time to cool down, that I left with a seared mouth that took a day to recoup.

The Saba sushi- hand pressed smoked mackerel sushi was good. It had a nice smokey taste and it was 3 pieces for $5. I also ordered the agedashi tofu- lightly fried and submerged in light semi sweet dashi sauce with bonito flakes. I like this dish very much. The shrimp tempura udon came with two shrimp and a tiny piece of eggplant. Portions were tiny and the pieces were very little. Tempura was nice and crispy and tasted good. The soup was rather bland. I ordered the chikura udon which had chicken - dark meat and diced and mochi. The soup was flavorful and the udon was bouncy and chewy. The mochi taste very odd and I did not like it. It felt out of place with the soup and udon. I would not order this.

Leslie T.,/user_details?userid=1msVg_B-Ef6K814sQDOTPA,"New York, NY",2/28/2018,4.0,"Having gone to Japan two months ago, I've really been craving some good Udon. After scouring the internet looking and hoping for another euphoric bowl of Udon - I'm glad to have come across Raku. What makes or breaks a good bowl of noodles is the texture, in my opinion. Raku's Udon was slimy and not as chewy as I wanted, but it was still pretty dang good. My friend got the shrimp tempura udon - after claiming he wouldn't order anything since he was ""full"" - but upon walking in, he knew that he couldn't pass up this opportunity for some authentic Japanese Udon. I got the simple egg udon which was exactly what I wanted. The broth was a little saltier than I'd like and a little too simple for my taste, but the egg and the vegetables made it worth it. Also, it was a little chilly outside and nothing makes you feel better than a hot bowl of noodle soup on a chilly New York day. Pretty easy to find, we got there right at 11:30 on a Saturday and snagged the last table of 2. Other people after us got seats at the bar and the wait quickly became 30-40 minutes after we seated (we were super lucky!). Come hungry, leave satisfied. Good Udon, but still on the search for one that mimics Shin Udon in Shinjuku ;'( Message me any recommendations!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Excellent place if you are looking for good Udon and some small plates to nosh on with the delicious chewy noodles. My favorite so far is the seaweed udon and the plain udon with dipping sauce. The chicken udon had a good broth but the mochi was not exactly what I expected. The shrimp tempura udon was good but the broth needed a little extra kick to it which was easily fixed with the spicy sesame seasoning that they had on the table.

Jennifer T.,/user_details?userid=zYLIJ83hvdSnHQSIFX-oQA,"Queens, NY",4/5/2016,5.0,"Best udon I've had in the city! It's an extremely small place but once you go inside you feel as though you've been transported into a real noodle shop in Japan. It has a real simple and Zen feel to it. Anyway, I ordered the Ebiten Udon (Shrimp Tempura) and when it came out I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were two lightly fried pieces of shrimp and a slice of eggplant tempura sitting on a plate above a deep bowl of steaming hot udon. Usually the shrimp is already in the broth and then it gets all soggy by the time it reaches your table, so I enjoyed the fact they separated them and the way it was presented overall. Anyway, the broth itself is really light yet deep in flavor and honestly the favorite part for me was the chewy noodles. The noodles were thick but look and tasted freshly made and hand cut. It was just the perfect texture and comes with a nice amount of spinach. I thought that it wouldn't be filling (I have a big appetite), but that bowl is deeper than you might imagine and there was a good hefty amount of noodles. You basically won't leave there stinkin' full, but you won't be hungry either. Anyway, I would definitely come back to try more! The Ebiten I ordered was $14, and most of the noodles will range from $12-$18.

The noodles are fresh and chewy and always served piping hot (unless you order cold udon). The workers are polite and helpful and always fulfill a request quickly. The only downsides to this restaurant are that: 1) it's a cash only establishment, so if you want to eat here, be sure to bring $20-30 per person and 2) it's very small and they don't take reservations as far as I know so you're unlikely to be seated immediately if you have a medium to large sized group.

In a way, that makes it very seemingly secretive and only those looking for it will find it. Everything inside is very neatly organized, albeit a bit cozy. The lighting is warm and it complements the wooden tables well. The bathroom is even pretty cool as it has a sliding door and is well kept. As per other yelp reviews,  I tried the Niku Udon option and I definitely was not disappointed. Coming in a large black bowl, the soup fills it about 3/5 of the way. The broth has a very pleasant, savory smell that is very enticing. The udon noodles are chewy in a good way and not too soft at all. It absorbed the flavoring of the broth very well too although I would say the broth by itself is a tad too salty. The beef is still mildly red on inside and it tears easily apart with each bite. The beef tripe is very tender as well. Overall, it was a enjoyable environment and the food was quite excellent.

I had the gyunan udon and loved it - the udon was soft and chewy, and the broth was clean and refreshing. We came on a Saturday evening around dinnertime and there was a 45 minute wait, so definitely come early if you can to beat the dinnertime crowd, especially since the restaurant is rather small with limited seating. It can get quite loud in the restaurant because of the small seating area, but the food makes up for it. This place can be easy to miss since there isn't a sign, but be on the lookout for a wooden door covered by white and blue curtains.

The inside is also small so it's not great for parties larger than 4. I came with a friend later in the afternoon so we were seated right away. We decided to share chicken tatsuka-age and a gyunan udon with a poached egg and extra udon noodles. The chicken was juicy and served with a spicy mayo sauce. I wish they had given us more mayo as it was gone after the first two pieces of chicken. The udon was very good. The noodles had a nice chew and you could definitely tell that they were freshly made. Also, the bowl of udon is huge. You can't tell through the pictures on Yelp, but it is big. While this place can run pretty steep for just a bowl of udon, a hack would be to share a bowl with a friend and order extra noodles or even toppings to stretch your dollar.

They were given a table immediately bc a table of four just left. However, the tables are by couple so the restaurant could have totally split the tables and sat us and the couple after us. Instead, they chose to sit the four that came after all of us. A few more minutes later, they sit the couple that came after us. That was the last straw and we left.

I've had it several times around the US and even in Japan, and I must say it's one of the best I've ever tried. It was easy to tell that the ankimo was prepped by a professional. The seasonings on it were just the right consistency, and the presentation was 5-star worthy. The only bad thing I noticed was the crowd - the tables here are very close to each other, and it got so crowded soon after we sat down to the point where we didn't really have any privacy. I could notice that the people on the table next to us could listen to our conversation without even trying, and we we're speaking in a pretty quiet tone. I would probably come back here, but not after 5pm because judging from my first visit, that's when guests start pouring in.

I would've never expected an Asian inspired bakery from the outside! I'll definitely have to come back to try the other flavors and pastries.

The interior is really brightly decorated and there's a few tables, although they were all full when I came around 4 PM on a Saturday. There were a decent number of people inside, and some of the flavors were sold out. We got the black sesame and seasonal strawberry Sakura cream puffs, and they were both really good. I was surprised because only the cream on top of the puff is flavored, and the filling inside is just vanilla, but the flavors still came through. I especially loved the black sesame, since the flavor was really rich and strong. The strawberry one was solid, but I couldn't really taste the Sakura. They're pretty small and a little expensive for the price, considering you can get larger ones for only one or two more dollars at Alimama or Bibble and Sip, but I still really enjoyed them.

Yaqi Y.,/user_details?userid=ZWRZMQh3avx8Ou_NT9Zrug,"Brooklyn, NY",7/16/2022,4.0,"Just got back from this cute spot in Williamsburg for a nice evening out. Ordered the NY strip (14oz) , market fish which was a whole branzino, and side of shishito peppers. Overall, delicious meal and would recommend for a nice date or a group dinner. Staff was nice and attentive to refilling our glass. The branzino was moist and flavorful.  Shishito pepper was Amazing! It was definitely salted & charcoaled; had a great smoky flavor. NY strip was done as requested medium well, however the ""side"" of watercress was bland. Not sure if it was meant as a garnish or actually meant as a side salad. Considering the steak was still, a simple dressing drizzled over the watercress would've sealed the deal for me. The only other annoying thing was the 2.7% credit usage fee which was not mentioned prior until the bill came.

Their wagyu sushi, salmon rolls, and uni and wagyu sushi is also delicious. Moving onto the steak entrees, I was a little disappointed at how the steaks came out because it was barely warm when it was served to our table. My friends and I came on a Sunday night at 9pm.

david l.,/user_details?userid=74eE-jgCGO24YKIci38UcQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/27/2021,4.0,Overall a great meal and great service. Steaks are dry aged in house. They are busrting with flavor and super tender. Things I think they can improve on is seasoning. Everything was just slightly under seasoned from the steak to the herb butter. The roasted potatoes was topped with a bit to much herb butter. The Waygu Tartare lacked any flavor. I've never had Japanese Waygu but I understand it to not have a intense beef flavor however the tartare was bland. The perfectly aged steaks made up for the slight misses,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Only 3 desserts listed on menu. The matcha became a bit cloying by the third bite though. Hip Williamsburg vibe. No one over 40 here. All getting a jump start to clogged arteries.

Charlie K.,/user_details?userid=IOolXA_22efa3VJ15I6c1A,"Queens, NY",11/8/2021,2.0,It's alright I guess but for $400 meal much better options elsewhere that doesn't make you wait two hours for a rather simple porterhouse steak to come out. Perhaps they were understaffed but not even a word? Sushi is actually very good  for a steakhouse but also took an hour half to come out.

We started off with the wagyu sushi, and also got the shrimp crunch, and the 36oz porterhouse steak. The wagyu sushi was okay, we didn't like it but that may just be us because we're not used to eating raw meat. The shrimp crunch was SO good, definitely recommend it. It was fresh, spicy, crunchy, simply delicious. Now the porterhouse, phenomenal. It came out sizzling hot, perfectly juicy and well seasoned. The lemon butter on it was so tasty. Lastly for dessert we got the matcha cake. One of my favorites as well. It was creamy with the perfect matcha flavor that wasn't too little or too much. It went beautifully with the vanilla ice cream. Their pineapple cocktail is also really really good, highly recommend. Staff was so friendly and attentive, service was great.

We didn't order any appetizers apart from drinks. The shiso mojito and the salt/charcoal drinks were sweet, strong and refreshing. We ordered the duck entree as well as the New York strip which came with a lemon butter sauce. Although I enjoyed the steak, I don't think it needed the butter but nonetheless the steak was soo tender, juicy and it hit the spot.

This has been my second time here, once during the first year opened and second time was the other week. First time I remembered the service could've been better and was very meh, second time was flat out terrible. Reservations were at 9 but we didn't get seated until 9:15. Once they seated us, you would think they cared to ATLEAST ask if we want some water for the table right away like ANY normal place would normally do. But no, we sat there for exactly a whole 30 minutes with no one checking in on us one bit let alone having water on the table!! After the half hour, we had to get up and look for our waiter for his attention in which he replied in such a rude manner!! Yet he still did not service us right away after we had to come up to him. 45 minutes later, and he finally came to take our order!!! RIDICULOUS, with no genuine sincere apology. We were absolutely starving at that rate so we even ordered 2-3 cocktails with him right away knowing that their service would be slow all night just from that start as well as all of our food. Told them it doesn't have to wait for it all to be ready to come to our table or which order whether if entree or appetizer came first... to just fire it all up since we were just so hungry at that rate. But no, the food took awhile to come, and it all just came together. It was so hard to even enjoy the food after being so upset. I remember the first time I ate here I really enjoyed the filet mignon with uni however, the beef and tuna tartares as well as some other dish that is not on the menu this time.

We were seated outside, and although it didn't have the cutest decor, the service and food made up for it. Our waitress was really attentive and sweet but our meal felt a little rushed, possibly due to it being a busy night? Unsure but they were coming to grab our plates pretty quickly even when we weren't finished. For an expensive dinner like this one, I would've expected to be able to savor my meal. Anyway, on to the food! We started with the truffle chawanmushi which was light but flavorful. We also had the fried oysters which I thought were so juicy! I saw people raving about the wagyu tartare so we got that but I would probably skip this next time. The wagyu was unfortunately overpowered by the noodles it came with. The wagyu uni sushi would've probably been a better choice. My absolute favorite was the uni filet mignon - worth the splurge! They are generous with the uni and it is definitely enough to share for two. Being the child I am, I also ordered the cheese fries which were thin and crispy just the way I like them.

Rachel T.,/user_details?userid=Y3uPto9AFvqzC7Hntfto4g,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",12/5/2020,5.0,Went to Salt + Charcoal about 2 years ago and again recently with friends and both times have been just amazing. A cozy intimate restaurant in Williamsburg that brings a lot of flavor and quality food. Their charcoal grilled edamame and cheese fries are great! All the sushi was very fresh and the 30 day dry aged porterhouse was perfect. I loved the uni wagyu roll and tuna tartare (which is freshly made at the table). The Japanese Prime Wagyu is literally perfection if you really want to splurge.

Rachel N.,/user_details?userid=evUdxhPnsyN_a2bvynPVAg,"New York, NY",7/15/2022,2.0,"We used to love Salt + Charcoal but the service has become terrible. We placed a pickup order on a Tuesday evening recently, and the estimated pickup kept increasing. Eventually, the estimated pickup climbed to 10:30 pm - more than an hour later than originally estimated. We kept trying to call the restaurant to find out what was going on and being put on hold for 5+ minutes with no one ever coming back onto the phone to talk to us. We finally just went to the restaurant in person because we were starving and had no idea what was going on. The guy at the counter didn't seem to care that it had now been over an hour since we placed our pickup order and told us to just cancel it because it would be a ""very very long time"" before it was ready.  He also refused to seat us so we could just eat there in person, despite the restaurant being mostly empty. We had to cancel the order on DoorDash and then waste more time contacting DoorDash to get a refund processed because Salt + Charcoal wouldn't do anything on their end to communicate that the cancellation was not our fault. I tried to reach out to the restaurant about this by email afterwards and never received a reply. I love the food here, but Salt + Charcoal clearly doesn't care about service so we unfortunately won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I had the pleasure of celebrating my 25th birthday here 2 years ago and it was superb. From the Baked Potatoes to the various dipping sauces. And the Porterhouse; one of the best steaks in my life. Cooked to absolute perfection. The first time I visited it was 48 Day aged, and the latter time only 30. No matter, it was just as tender and flavorful as the first time. The customer service is always A1. We wanted to try something a little different after having a lot of hard liquor before we arrived so our waiter recommended we try S+C's signature cocktails which were perfect. Aside from the food and drinks, S+C is one of those smaller niche spots, which is perfect for me and my friends, but don't expect to have a huge dinner here. It's tailored to smaller groups looking for a more intimate setting. The outside seating reminds me of one of those Little Italy mafia hangouts, minus the tacky tablecloths. I mention this spot to anyone I know who enjoys a good steak. A must-have in Williamsburg.

I mean if your salivary glands are working properly, you're in trouble coming here.  I went here on a date with my boyfriend and got carried away literally (and physically :-p) my taste buds were wowed with every bite! From the appetizer down to the entree even the still fancy WATER, YES THE $9 bottle water of Saratoga! It was awesome and so fresh, everything! I looked at the menu and reviews prior to going and I still wasn't ready for the amazement I was about to encounter. For the appetizer we ordered the Salt + Charcoal Crab Cake, it was too divine. It honestly can be a mini meal, it was shared sized portion to tenderize your palate for everything that was about to come. It was delectable even with the garnish salad and wasabi cream sauce on which it was plated. Everything went really well together! For the entree, we did the shared 50 day Jyukusei Porterhouse Steak Steak for two. For sides, cheese fries, grilled broccoli and baked potatoes. Now it was massive! It was definitely a portion made for 2 (or more-they also have for 3 the steak portion). The steak was prepared upon request as medium well. AND WELL IT WAS! Honestly, it was melt in your mouth steak. Not much chewing required.  Just typing this review all over again I want to revisit. The cheese fries I'd say I can skip for the next time because the cheese got cold and wasn't as enjoyable because we were so focused on the other foods we forgot about that mundane order lol. The cheese fries were good but the steak, those sauces and those potatoes was the star of the night! I was stuffed after that meal! There was no way you wouldn't be stuffed.

Met a friend here for dinner. Very cozy and intimate space with low lighting and a fridge full of aged meat in the front. Was greeted by a very friendly waitress (Kiome). We started off with some lychee martinis, grilled octopus and edamame, which Kiome said was cooked with some secret oil. Both were delicious! The octopus was flavorful and we were given two large tentacles, and the edamame wasn't just all talk. The secret oil was in fact delightful. We shared the 14oz 50 day aged NY Strip. The steak itself was amazing. We got the grilled veggies (apparently from finger lakes), which honestly we probably could've done without (16$ for grilled veggies seems a little steep). Overall excellent food and presentation. Service was great, I would come back to try to wagyu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I won't even fault them for the lack of seafood, things happen, i get that. Service was terrible, table was terrible. Sat next to a screaming child.

Stacey J.,/user_details?userid=MILzeGI0hWbYmPneKhJXrQ,"Queens, NY",3/28/2021,1.0,"Only come if you have all day to spare(waiting for the food). We had a birthday dinner reservation at 8:15pm, food didn't come until close to 11pm and the restaurant closes at 10pm. I can understand maybe like 30-1 hr waiting time for our food to arrive since it's a Saturday night but no, especially at a ""high end "" restaurant. Nobody should ever wait over 2 hours for their food. Reading other reviews about how the steak made up for the wait... unfortunately it did not. They served us our sides first, that was supposed to be eaten with our main course, then main course came after the sides which baffles me. We ordered porterhouse for 3, medium. It was over cooked and a lot of fatty pieces that you can't even eat. The steak was very chewy and has a lot of muscle fibers in it, making it even harder to chew. Wagyu sushi($24 for 2 pieces) lacked any taste, literally tasted like a piece of garlic. Forgot 2 of the drinks we ordered. We were extremely excited since there are so many good reviews here, but the waiting is no joke and that really take your appetite away. This is not acceptable. The only good thing was the whiskey my bf ordered, that's about it. They did apologize for the wait but it seems like it's a norm here. If you want good quality steak, don't go here. If you want good sushi, don't go here. Only come here if you have the time to wait, like a long catch up session with a friend you haven't seen in ages. There's no reason for steak and sushi to be served over 2 hours late, I mean come on, it's steak and sushi, not braised short ribs. Anyway, super disappointed and will never step afoot in here again. Just a regular restaurant that wants to be fake fancy with its steep price. Saying sorry doesn't change anything, making changes to your mistakes does. Start making real changes if you want patrons to come again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was a little over $30 for two pieces but those two pieces left me wanting more! We had to resist since we still had the uni filet mignon coming out. As we waited for our main dish, our waiter brought out some chips for us to munch on. I didn't think the filet mignon would that big so we added some lamb chops. The entrees and the cheese fries came out at the same time which made a really nice full table picture for Instagram but as we began to eat our fries got cold and the cheese wasn't as melted as they looked in the pic. The uni filet mignon was so delicious (I'm drooling for more while posting these pictures). On the menu, it is M.P. for market price. The wait staff will gladly tell you the market price when you order. I ordered without asking and our waiter informed me the price before proceeding with my order.

Maxi L.,/user_details?userid=c3ctd-erq8O6lFXslPiRzw,"New York, NY",5/30/2019,4.0,We came here to celebrate our anniversary. We started with fried oysters and Uni sashimi. Both were good/small  and not filling. We decided to share the Uni fillet mignon as the main dish because we would probably eat again later on. The waiter was phenomenal! Service was excellent! He told us in advance the cut would take about 45 mins to prepare and it would be a good idea to pick out the main course first if we decided to choose steak as an option. We did however waited about an hour+ they  gave us some complimentary lotus chips while we were waiting but it was really taking a long time. We did see a lot of the porter house cut being ordered and we would love to try that next time! The steak finally came and Uni was amazing as always! The fillet mignon cut was very thick to my surprise and it was a great portion to share. But the meat was a bit chewy. It wasn't that soft butter cut that I expected. We asked for medium rare too so I was a bit disappointed. When we saw all of those porter house steaks I thought to myself did we order the wrong item. Because it seemed like we were the only table eating the Uni fillet mignon. But anyway we will be back to try something else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I came here last night for dinner around 8:30 and the tables were taken but the server (a really sweet girl) told us we can sit at the bar until something opens up, we sat ordered our drinks and food and luckily someone left not long after. THE YUZU MOJITO IS BOMB! it was so good i finished it in less than 5 minutes! If you have not tried it yet definitely try it! We ordered the 50 day aged steak and the wagyu... their menu was quite confusing they have the price listed as one price but mentions its (8oz for two people) for the wagyu and min order of two but has the price as $49 next to it...when its suppose to be $98?!?  I don't understand why it wasn't labeled as $98 to begin with if you had to order two minimum but only get one steak?!? Anyways... we had an order of wagyu which was really good, i enjoyed that alot more than they 50 day aged (we ordered medium rare and it came out medium well.) quite dry and a little overcooked .. We got an order of branzino and it was okay but slightly overcooked as well... i think i prefer raw fish more because there's no bones. The wagyu sushi was REALLY GOOD and the Wagyu with uni was really good too those were probably my two favorite dishes the whole night. We also tried the octopus appetizer which was perfectly cooked... I would switch the branzino with hamachi next time. The server was really nice and friendly, water was refilled in a timely manner.   Took off one star for my overcooked 50 day aged steak and one star for the mediocre branzino which was slightly overcooked.. our bill came out to be 400 for three people after tips and tax.

LeAnne B.,/user_details?userid=s6fmAliBn4-pNR7udaTQ7g,"New York, NY",4/15/2018,4.0,I was surprised to find that this place has a downstairs section at the end of the hall. The spirits selection is vast to say the least so be prepared to sift through the drink menu for a while if you're the indecisive type. I would highly recommend the crab cakes as a starter - delicious! The miso soup is the best I've ever tasted. However the reason this is four stars instead of five though is because the duck was a bit chewy and not as tender as I would have hoped - especially when you have to wait 30 minutes more for ordering it! Bonus points for presentation though and the dipping sauces that come with it. I would like to come back and actually try a steak here as I like the atmosphere and east meets west steakhouse fusion concept. Would be perfect for a nice albeit expensive date!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Tatiana f.,/user_details?userid=Tbg3nNccw9yOV3_v11zbvA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/22/2019,5.0,"My friend brought me here to try wagyu for the first time and wow it was an experience like I've never had before. I will caveat that the wagyu steak is very expensive so it might not be in everyone's budget but if you can afford it then it's worth trying at least once. We got the portion for 2 ($150) which comes with 6 3-inch slices of meat (about 2-3 bites per slice) so it's small but it is so packed with flavor, so rich and buttery, that if you get some sides or appetizers you should be satisfied. Wagyu comes from cows bred in japan that are fed a special diet and raised so that they have a high fat content that is intermuscular/marbled within the muscle which creates a texture and taste unlike any other steak. Every bite of meat is like butter with a seared crisp on the outside. I don't know how else to describe it. We also got the wagyu sushi which was my favorite. The matcha cake was good too. The shishito and eggplant starter was delicious. The service was excellent. We sat downstairs which was really intimate, quiet, and cozy.

The service is always great. Very well educated staff. The Wagyu is a must try, as there is no steak that comes close to matching the flavor. I was even able to have a conversation with our waiter to find out he is a native of Miyazaki. Not only is the wagyu to die for, but the dry aged porterhouse will have you drooling as soon as you walk up to be seated. The drooling continues until you see it come to your table with the delicious discs of butter. Cooked perfectly to the requested medium rare, every piece from top to bottom was full of flavor and just melted away. For dessert, the matcha cake is a great fluffy realization that there is room left in your belly. On top of the great food, I've never been let down by any of the cabs or sake I've enjoyed.

We went in the summer and they had the windows open which was very pleasant. We sat at the bar and had an awesome view  of the love graffiti wall across. Armando the bartender was super and made me a Mai-hito  ( his impromptu  Mai style mohjito infused with Prosecco/ something that seems to be making its way soon to the menu ) ..what a creative mixologist. The shrimp tempura roll was to-die-for and so was the kale  salad that had pickled lotus roots!!!!.. divine! We shared a grilled branzino fish of of the day ..cooked to perfection!

The appetizers tuna tartare and the shisito peppers were good. The steak was cooked well. It was my birthday dinner. My only complaint was that they could not accommodate one more person, and stressed that when reservations are changed, we would have to be seated at 8, two hours later, they offered us seats next to one another at the bar. While I was waiting, there were a group of 3 who walked in, they didn't have reservations, and she told them she doesn't have a seat for them until later, and then they were seated them immediately.

Reason the reservation for outdoor must be made on the day of is because it must be weather permitted. The manager even went ahead to assure he is the manager and that it will be noted that I called ahead of time. Saturday comes around, I call at 12pm, was told that the reservation can only be made by the manager, but the manager won't be in until 2-3pm. Tried calling in again around 2pm, manager still isn't in. Finally by 3pm a manager calls me back. But a different manager this time. She tells me that the outdoor seating is fully booked by ppl who called ahead of time. She even tried to claim that the other manager meant to say, it was their intention to say I'm on the waiting list Incase someone cancels.

I'm all for paying extra for good cuisine but to find out a basic tuna avocado roll was over $20 was kind of ridiculous. They had steaks and wagyu items that were about $48-52 each, however for that price there was no sides given. So it was just very expensive for the sake of saying they are a fusion restaurant.

For drinks, I had the Passion Fizz and the boyfriend got the Yuzu Mule. The drinks were well made and had the perfect balance of alcohol and flavor. Our lovely waitress said that it would take about 45 mins for our rare Porterhouse Steak to be cooked and suggested that we order an appetizer/side while we waited. (That's when we opted for the Special, which was delicious) While we were waiting, our waitress gave us some sort of Veggie Chips, free of charge! All the servers were very attentive and cute! Our waters would always be refilled before hitting the half way point. The Porterhouse steak was beautifully presented and the sauces that went with it, complimented the meat well.

Gregorio C.,/user_details?userid=bTkQWMY_lGJOPp0L8EO9NA,"Bronx, NY",11/30/2017,5.0,No turkey this thanksgiving just some good cuts of steak at Salt and Charcoal. Other people had the same idea to let someone else cook up a great meal and be served at the same time. Started with the Japanese Wagyu and uni shooters. Two small servings but so fresh and a perfect pairing. Moved on to grilled edemamme and it had a nice deep flavor so different from your everyday legumes. The main dish was the skirt steak with grilled broccoli. Enough for two people and the dry aging was spot on. so succulent and juicy. That grill makes all the difference.

I had waited in heavy anticipation for the one person I knew would agree to go to get into town ( a lot of my friends are vegan/ would rather not drop money on dinner). We go, we order, anticipation builds, and the most mediocre steak I have ordered in the past 3 years was set down before me. The meat was tough and greasy ( to be clear it was not marbled and fatty and this maybe coming off as greasy it was just greasy). It was also very over cooked. My waiter honestly didn't really pay attention to us at all he looked at two early twenties girls and probably assumed what a lot of people do, that we wouldn't be spending enough for him to care, which really wasn't true we both were prepared to spend around $150 for each of us.

We had the Valentine's Day menu ($100 per person) and everything was pretty good except a few things. The crab cake we tried was a little dry but the sushi, sashimi and soup were good. But the most important part, the wagyu ($24 additional), was disappointing. I had already tried wagyu in Japan so my standards were pretty high. It was way too fat and had too much charred/Smokey flavor. This is coming from someone who loves fatty/intensive flavored steak. It honestly felt like I was just eating really fat bbq meat and I could barely finish it because it ruined my appetite. My boyfriend, his friend and his girlfriend all agreed that it could been better. However, we also all agreed that the matcha chocolate cake topped with ice cream, strawberries, and blackberries was really good.

Cheese fries were covered in powdery cheese and cold.  Regular fries were also cold when served.  Charred broccoli sides were mushy as-- tasted like frozen thawed broccoli.   Wagyu steak was good but they have this obsession with sauces that really are not necessary if your steak is good quality.  Uni steak was a waste of money.   Customer service was good at table.  Hostess was not nice-- walked into the empty restaurant (we had reservation for 5:30 when they open) holding 2 toddlers and the hostess insisted we stand and wait because we had to have a full party before allowing us to settle with the kids at our table in the basement even though we explained the other 2 were just finishing parking the car 1 block away.   It's just not empathic, esp in a 100%empty restaurant and the fact that we confirmed our reservation 3 times!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

JoJo G.,/user_details?userid=lvui4kiS5rzKGCJs-uELKQ,"New York, NY",10/19/2018,1.0,"What started as a fun friends reunion in NY turned into a very unfortunate event none of us will ever forget or expect for it to happen to anyone in NY. We made a reservation for 6:00 pm for 5 (all women) and were there on time. Our servers were great. Unfortunately around 7:30 pm as we had just ordered our last round of drinks, a man approached our table with check in hand and told us we had exceeded the 2 hour limit they have on tables. We informed him it had not been 2 hrs yet, which was backed up by the hostess. We told him we were waiting for desert, which arrived as we were saying that to him, and that we were waiting on the last round of drinks. We told him that the check needed to be updated to include those items. As rude as his approach had been we were fine with getting the updated check as we were planning to leave by 8 pm anyway.  He came back with an updated check and we asked for the bill to be split evenly into 4(normal in most places) his response was ""I don't know where you are from, but here in America we don't do this"" and was arguing we didn't understand how things work here. To his surprise although upset we all kept our composure and reminded him that this nation is one of immigrants and that as it happens we are all naturalized citizens that arise from different Latin American countries, with the exception of one whose ancestors have been here for hundreds of years. We paid our $600 bill and made sure to leave a 20% tip to our servers because they honestly did not have not have anything to do with their manager's opinions and looked quite embarrassed to be honest. The restaurant had a  group (5) coming in but there were many booths and other tables that had been there longer than us and were no longer consuming anything. The difference is they were all males and not Latinos as he assumed we all were. We left and our driver as scheduled showed up at 7:50 pm we explained what had happened and that we forgot an umbrella and did not feel comfortable going back in by ourselves.  He accompanied me and that same manager approached me with the umbrella in hand. I asked him why he said what he said in a calm tone, I don't believe in shouting to get a point across but rather in showing that educated people can get a point across through conversations. He acknowledge he is an immigrant himself, and said he didn't think it was offensive at first to which our driver responded it was highly inappropriate to say that to any patrons especially to a group of ladies. He asked if the new guests at the table were aware there was a 2 hr maximum and a maximum of cards one can use to which he replied ""no"".  I reminded him that the website nor the hostess made any mention of such rules when we first made the reservation or when we arrived to the restaurant. We reminded him to treat others with respect. It finally felt like he understood what he had said and how he made us feel, he offered his card and a round of drinks to which replied no thanks. I advised him to go through unconscious bias training and to update his website so no one ever would go through what we did. It was embarrassing and quite honestly hurtful. He had a group of professional women as clients, some are also military wives and for us to be judged solely on our ""looks""  even while dressed professionally was quite upsetting. Oh and he was surprised we were fluent in English too. Training is required***",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sadly I decided to go there for my brother in laws birthday ( a party of 9). We ordered 2 appetizers and individual entrees. We patiently waited but over an hour had gone by and not even the appetizers. My sister goes to what we thought was the manager but turned out to be the owner. With a big smile and nicely asks for an ETA on the food bc we have reservations after for drinks. He proceeds to tell her that "" This isn't mcdonalds."" My sister keeps her cool ( I wouldn't have, to be honest) and replies with "" I'm not trying to give you a hard time. I just have reservations that I don't want to miss"". His wiseass remark was "" oh I won't remeber you tomorrow"" . Naturally my sister retorts back with "" And I won't remeber you"" and calmly comes back to the table. So we almost have our food. They brought the appetizers along with the entrees. Now I must give credit to the servers bc they were apologetic unlike the owner. So now finally the last entree. We get about 2 bites in and the owner brings us the bill. So I commented right to him "" oh we wait and wait but the bill comes really fast. Nice asshole"" I admit I was offended by his awful attitude and customer service. No one was rude or complained until I spoke up. He then kneels down and asks how does it take us to cook chicken at home. Talk about some nerve. The portions were tiny. Appetizers come before the meal buddy.

The steak in my wife's salad looked boiled, which is just a travesty for place that specializes in steak. Meanwhile, the person next to us got the steak salad as well. Got unappetizing boiled chunks for meat. Brought it up to the service staff, and simply got a ""sorry, it shouldn't be like that"". She did get her whole bill at the end.

He was chatting with two girls, giving them free drinks, entertaining his friends and even gave my drink to them that I ordered since they wanted the same as soon as they sat down (after I ordered). No one checked on us to see how we were liking the food (we didn't), and it took nearly 15 minutes of us sitting there with our food in front of us to get someone to notice we wanted the check. The restaurant was pretty empty so busy-ness isn't an excuse. It was our anniversary and we paid nearly $250 for drinks, apps, and entrees that were underwhelming to say the least. Not to mention it was freezing cold and the staff kept opening the door to move chairs and tables around. Honestly just a poor and disappointing experience all around. Sucks too because I was very excited to go here.

Jordyn M.,/user_details?userid=xQBr2M45hK8a6kO9vv4F0A,"New York, NY",1/29/2023,1.0,"We were incredibly disappointed in our experience at Casa Tulum. In addition to finding the food underwhelming (which was the least of our concerns), we had a horrible experience with respect to dietary restrictions: I am gluten free and upon ordering our appetizers I informed our waitress and asked to confirm everything we had ordered was gluten free. She said yes. When we ordered our entrees I once again reminded her I was gluten free and she confirmed again that yes everything we ordered was gluten free. I bothered to double check and ask her specifically if the tortillas they used for our meals would be corn or flour (as flour tortillas are not GF) and she confirmed that everything would be gluten free. Our meal arrived and in the darkness of the restaurant I could barely see my food. I bit into my tacos and about 2 bites in I realized I was most definitely eating a flour tortilla. I immediately called the waitress over, reminded her of the fact that I was gluten free (for now the fourth time) and asked if I was in fact eating a flour tortilla that would have gluten in it. Her response was the equivalent of ""oops"" and her only resolve was to bring me a corn tortilla on the side. Thank GOD I do not have a serious allergy (though I was ultimately up all night ill as a result) but I cannot imagine what would have happened if I did. On top of all that, she didn't even bother to remove the item from our bill. I have never experienced such poor service with respect to dietary restrictions and this restaurant and the treatment I received truly is so dangerous and potentially deadly for some. If you are a person with any sort of dietary restriction I would NOT go near this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/casatulum-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I wasn't expecting a full Japanese grocery store complete with a wonderful array of prepared foods. I ended up getting some chicken karaage and a cha shu onigiri. What I thought would be a quick bite on the train ended up being me just demolishing these because they were delicious. The karaage was moist and perfectly salted. Even though it had clearly been made hours before by the time I got to them, they were still crispy. The cha shu onigiri had nice chunks of tender fatty pork throughout the rice and was also well-seasoned. It was much better than the onigiris I had in Hawaii. Both were pretty reasonably priced for NYC. I tried to come back later in my trip but made the mistake of coming during lunch hour on a weekday, and the lines at the register were insane.

Highly recommend this, great combination of flavors if you want a sampler all in one and can't choose between multiple fillings. The spicy tuna was equally delicious and very filling. Thought it would be mostly rice and very little filling, but there is actually a decent amount of filling inside. You can order from the counter and have them pack it for you or you can head further into the store and check out the deli section where there are more bento boxes, drinks, etc. They also have a prepacked lunch deal in the deli section during weekdays that comes with 2 rice balls and the karaage!

The employees are super friendly and you can watch them make the rice balls but these just aren't for me :( The flavor was good but it was way too much rice. I felt like I wasn't getting enough of a filling to rice ratio in every bite (and I love rice too!),https://www.yelp.com/biz/omusubi-gonbei-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'm so glad there is a place right in midtown where I can get tasty and well-priced onigiri along with other Japanese groceries inside Katagiri. Having purchased these a few times and tried several various types including the bomb (a large onigiri with three types of filling), my favorites are the Mentaiko (spicy seasoned cod roe), spicy salmon, and ume (pickled plum). I've been generally satisfied with the proportion of filling to rice, just the right amount to get some filling with each bite of rice. The little stand isn't manned all day--towards the end of the day they leave the remaining rice balls individually wrapped in plastic wrap on the counter with clear price lists so people can just pick up and check out. Better to go earlier in the day for the widest range of selection--by the end of the day some of the varieties are sold out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/omusubi-gonbei-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

When we asked the host if they were supposed to be cold- especially seeing as they came in tin foil and had butter in the side, he sheepishly said no, then returned to apologize and ask if he could offer us something else as there were no more potatoes. We assumed, given the situation that this would be on the house, it was after all a small dish that they brought completely cold and had no more of.

When we came in we were pretty excited, the place looks very intimate, however once we took a look at the menu we were turned off. Menu is very limited, prices are way too high. We have been to quiet a few Japanese restaurants and this is by far one of the worst. The edamame does not need a citrusy zest, the eggplant was not anything special just a poorly pickled vegg, we really wanted some raw fish (they just offered good old herring which I would only get at a Russian restaurant), and the dorado was somewhat decent. I honestly would never go back, I was quiet disappointed that my husband stayed pretty hungry after we left since nothing tastes good it was just ok. We were hungry so we had to eat. The scotch is very very overpriced. You do not have to pay$ 26 for a mediocre scotch and barely an ounce pour. Overall i would not go back and do not recommend to get the dishes we got.

Brianna Y.,/user_details?userid=reLf-qZK35KQM3ygB1jhAQ,"Manhattan, NY",7/2/2022,4.0,"The wagyu beef and sauce pairings were delicious - so succulent and juicy. You just want more of each bite. Whether it was the a5 wagyu beef, the American style wagyu or the pork belly, each bite was well thought out and worth savoring. The one reason this didn't merit 5 stars was the service. I mentioned my egg allergy at the start of the meal, and they highlighted the two dishes that could be an issue. They didn't really offer substitutions - just provided me with the dish sans egg. That was fine - until we got to the dessert, which was ice cream. It was one small scoop, and I ate most of it when the telltale tingling and swelling in my throat started. I asked the server if there was egg in the ice cream and she said yes. Suffice it to say, this was not the best way to end the meal. My husband was upset because this was our anniversary dinner, but fortunately, I was able to throw up my most recent bites. The servers expressed very little concern or remorse. And we paid and left. It's fortunate for them that I don't have a more severe allergy (worst is an upset stomach and hives). They had no way of knowing that, but for the amount you're paying and experience they're aiming to give you, you'd think they'd do a little more on the service side of things, especially when they made an error that could have ruined a celebratory evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shabushabu-mayumon-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jaclyn C.,/user_details?userid=V8J3UyAdmv_YxeRL7xYPJA,"Los Angeles, CA",9/28/2020,5.0,Hands down MY FAVORITE shabu spot ever!!! The whole experience was super unique and personal. The place is very clean and due to covid they are only doing 2 seatings for dinner with 3 ppl max per night. Make sure you make a reservation!! Our waitress served and cooked us every single dish right in front of us. The quality is superb. All beef are wagyu and they feed you in 14 different ways! I have had a lot of shabu but I never had a shabu omakase like this! You also get a homemade soba in the end and omg that ice cream... everything was made to perfection.

Stephanie W.,/user_details?userid=YkmMTGQYKt6CcxT19KAbNQ,"New York, NY",11/1/2020,5.0,"FANCY SHABU SHABU! I came here to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and the meal was phenomenal. We've been wanting to try this place for a while now and I'm so glad we did. So it's a whole course where the chef prepares the meat and food for you and then puts it into your plate so all you have to do is bring it to your mouth. They do it in front of you and you get to watch them swishing the meat into the water. The first piece of rib eye was mouth watering. It melts in your mouth and they cook it at a low temperature so it's not hot when you put it in your mouth but just right. Literally my eyes widened when I had the first piece and I was just craving for more. Every piece was amazing and went above my expectations. They started us off with a cup of sake and then moved into the salmon shiokara which was a little too fermented for my taste and i had 2 pieces of bone in it but after that it was a straight highway of heaven. My favorite piece was the first meat one with the A5 Miyazaki wagyu rib eye and then my second favorite is the washugyu rib eye with the blue cheese, fig sauce, balsamic sauce. This piece was very interesting because the combination worked so well and really left my mouth salivating even afterwards. I left the meal full and so satisfied. Would definitely recommend to try this place out and they do indoor dining so reserve and enjoy being taken care of!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shabushabu-mayumon-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Enrique S.,/user_details?userid=od1yu6CRwvDKQnBZvKprYQ,"Upper West Side, New York, NY",9/15/2021,5.0,"New Yorkers are blessed with the excellence of the beef and service at this quiet and small shabu shabu experience. From the delicate presentation of the 'goods' to the single serve bites of Heaven. What a treat to be served every single mouthful of a shabu shabu meal. I would've called it crazy but I am absolutely enjoying myself as I write this review only halfway through the service. The properly measured out temperature of each beef 'bite' is truly a science worth studying which Mayumon clearly has perfected. The in-between dishes of enoki mushrooms, or mozzarella wonton show the creativity and care that has gone into the preparation of this meal, not to mention the flavorful blue cheese and balsamic Wagyu sauce. My favorite 'unique' item being the Wagyu temaki, a rice roll with seaweed and the best beef. Each bite is calculated and balanced. How does one make a bite last longer? You will find yourself asking this very question as you taste the tender Miyazaki Wagyu melt in your mouth at the perfect temperature of bliss.

Derek L.,/user_details?userid=1ANv3NFewI4BkxOsSNHgiQ,"Bloomington, IN",4/24/2022,1.0,"It was an extremely unpleasant experience. The waitress was very rude and gave incorrect cancellation info compared with what is presented on their website. When we made the reservation via Yelp, there was nothing about full charge for cancellation. We got there late for 18 minutes and we were told if it passed 15 minutes they would not serve any of the appetizers on the menu but we would be charged for the full amounts in a very harsh tone. They also said since we were late, they had the right to charge full and didn't serve at all but they were showing empathy to let us dine in. The truth is I didn't even have any card to hold the reservation, which basically means they couldn't charge me if I cancelled. Also, I checked back their website after dining with them, it was 20 minutes in stead of 15 minutes late that there would be chance they wouldn't serve the appetizers. After 30 minutes, they would charge full for no show. I understand the no show/late policy, but their attitude made me feel I did something extremely wrong and should be punished for it. The food was okay and like most of other comments here OVERPRICED. If you are interested in Wagyu beef, there are lots of options in town with better service and price.

Me and a friend walked by Purepecha and decided to give it a try and I'm so glad we did. We felt welcomed by the staff as soon as we walked in. The ambiance is very cute and they have a pretty large menu. We both got margaritas - I got the classic and my friend got the raspberry cadillac margarita which she said was really good. First order of chips and salsa was free and they were really good. I ordered the chicken quesadilla which came with guac and pico de gallo. My friend ordered the shrimp fajitas which were a pretty big portion. We both loved our meals and the service was great. Might be hard to miss with the scaffolding outside but definitely worth a try.

We had had drinks at the bar a few weeks back and decided to try the food last night. The place was about 25% occupied indoors. As we wanted to sit inside we requested that of the host who greeted us at the entrance. He rudely and abruptly demanded our vaccine cards and ID. I felt like I was in an episode of Seinfeld and the soup nazi was now working at Purepecha. We didn't say anything but reached for our vaccine cards (we are both fully vaccinated). As we did so the host then rudely demanded that we wear masks until we reached our table and referred us to the sign on the door. I put on my mask and started to read the sign which stated that only no-vaccinated persons were required to wear masks. It was at that moment I notice HE WAS NOT WEARING A MASK!!! I questioned him and asked why we (fully vaccinated) were required to wear a mask to our table when he (vaccination status unknown) could freely wander the restaurant all night long, speaking to people, around food, where his spittle might land on the food, the people, etc. He basically told us that the rules don't apply to him. Not sure why. Now we don't oppose wearing masks or not wearing masks and are compliant with whatever the rules are, but the hypocrisy was just amazing. You demand (yes, demand in a very rude manner) that we wear masks to our table but you don't have to wear one at all? Huh?
