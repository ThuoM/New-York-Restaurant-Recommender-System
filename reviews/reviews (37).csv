You can order takeout at the counter or sit down to eat. I sat down and ordered the Beijing Street Noodles. The portion was honestly pretty big - lots of noodles, minced pork, and shredded cucumbers. Didn't notice the black bean sauce but overall pretty good. Overall, pretty straightforward place with nice portions and good prices for Williamsburg ($12 for this).

The food was okay, they have a happy hour that is pretty good. I tried the crispy chicken wings with soy garlic sauce, a mint mojito, and a scallion pancake. The wings were okay. They were crispy but the sauce didn't do it for me. I've had better soy garlic sauce. Also, you can't take the happy hour food to go. It must be eaten in the establishment which is okay. The ambiance was cool. It was a cool mixture of hip hop, pop and R&B. They have a couple tables where you can dine in. The service was just okay. The lady at the counter was busy doing other things each time we approached the counter. So it wasn't the best service. I asked a question about one of the food items and decided against it by the way she described it. It was almost as if we were disturbing her. I hate that feeling.

Also, I'm not going to flushing or the Bao on St Marks every time I want a soup dumpling. Â The crab and pork are delicious, get them. I wasn't a huge fan of the ""sandwich"" baos (including the duck others seem to like, it was glazed with too much soy/hoisin for me) or the non-soup dumplings.

The dan dan noodles were also exceptional. The snow pea shoots were a must order, and the Shanghai shumai were quite tasty (my friend said it reminded her of her grandmother's dishes from childhood).

If you're wanting Chinese and happen to be in this area of midtown just south of Central Park definitely consider Blue Willow. I would definitely return but it's not necessarily a place I would frequent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The only part that could have been better is the moistness of the noodle+sauce blend. It was a bit dry. The interior design is pretty cool too.

There's a constant chatter as it gets pretty busy even on a Thursday night-- reservations are highly recommended. The menu is labeled well with vegan options, and there is quite a selection of drinks. I highly recommend the cold sesame noodles, which were the perfect amount of sauce, and great nutty sweet salty flavor. They're a tiny bit spicy which added to the whole flavor profile without being painful. :) The home style tofu casserole dish is basically stewed tofu, with some bell peppers in a savory thick soy sauce base. There are shishito peppers, red bell pepper, and the fried tofu, with a generous amount of thick cut scallion. Very yummy. Presentation made it look and taste really nice but I can see it being a super comforting take out dish too. The chrysanthemum ice tea is also super refreshing and not the perfect amount of sweetness. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and want that kind of vibey sophisticated atmosphere with nice Chinese food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The vibe and aesthetic here is perfect. Smiles abound - as if they were privileged to host us. The food was outstanding. We had several dumplings, Grandmas Noodles, cauliflower stir fried (with pork belly). Each were scrumptious. Sooooo flavorful. We had a lovely pot of tea too.

Vanessa L.,/user_details?userid=axNlV76LulLJ246bG_RBOQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/1/2022,4.0,"4.5 stars! Pleasantly surprised by Blue Willow! I always pass by it during my treks to 5th Ave and usually notice small crowds by the restaurant. So, I decided to check it out with my family and friends. The interior is very beautiful, almost reminds me of Old 1950s Shanghai. As for the food, my favorites were the mapo tofu, red pork belly, and the green bean eggplant. Everything tasted very fresh and the fish and meat were tender. The spice level was also very tolerable.

First off, their Resy system is messed up and they take reservations they can't honor. We had to wait 30 minutes for ours, which is ridiculous because the whole point of the reservation is that you don't have a wait that's 20+ minutes long. They're also understaffed, but that's a common problem these days. Finally, the food is alright. The snow pea sprouts were absolutely delicious, but everything else (chili oil beef, eggplant, etc.) was just fine. Drinks came after our food.

A solid mix of traditional Szechuan with a creative twist, and it was all very well executed and flavorful. I particularly loved the Blue Willow fish (we got the sea bass), the Peking duck, and the snow pea sprouts. They have decent vegetarian options as well and accommodated my vegetarian friend who wanted to swap out meat with tofu in one of the dishes.

There was a lot of ingredients and the broth was flavorful. The Mountain Baked Fish was okay but not much fish. There was definitely a lot of vegetables though (tofu skin, lotus root, bean sprouts).

Decor has a retro vibe of a Shanghai speakeasy. We had Beef Brine Noodles Chengdu Spicy Wontons crispy shredded beef and fried rice with chicken . Â Fried rice was our favorite. The wet noodles with bits of beef were a soggy mess and bland. Â Crispy beef was definitely crispy with a sticky sweet sauce. Beef was chewy and had an unpleasant fryer oil aftertaste. Â Spicy wontons were ok. The chili crisp was good and spicy but the wontons themselves had almost no filling which was disappointing. Â We also had pan fried dumplings with pork to start . Were ok but ultimately forgettable. Â Lastly , service was lacking despite staff dashing to expedite food.

Then when when we were finally ready to order around 2:50pm for the lunch special the waitress didn't come by until 3:02pm (and we had to wave her down) to which she then told us ""sorry no more lunch special it ended at 3pm"". I mean cmon by 2min and we were ready to order long before. We tried to reason with her but she explained that the the system they use on their iPads automatically prohibit them from giving out the lunch special at 3pm.

Helen Y.,/user_details?userid=ws8flq1p7oSbgYIg2eyUvg,"Long Beach, CA",4/6/2022,4.0,"For the location, this might be one of the better option for Asian food around the area if you can't go to Flushing. We made a reservation for a table of 10 people. It would have been nice to know ahead of time that they require a minimum spending. You may want to confirm with them before booking a rsvp. For a group if 10, they required spending minimum $350. In the end, it came out about $35 per person which wasn't bad. But it's good to know still. The decor was great. I love the Shanghai vibes it gives out. We were able to get our own table that's more private. Food came out super fast. Some food were not good and those are usually the super fast ones that come out. The steam dumpling definitely taste like it's been sitting out a bit and reheated. Part of the dumpling skin tasted dry. The fried dumpling taste better because it was skillet on the bottom and came out warmer. I wouldn't get the ginger chicken. That one just doesn't taste good. But for their better food, you need to order the dishes that require preparation. One of their better dish is the dry pot where you can customize the meat and vegetables. It's still on the saltier side but definitely one of their better dishes. Their vegetable dishes such as fried green bean and the snow pea leaves were delicious. I was impressed by the snow pea leaves as it was fresh and taste really good. You'll need some veggies as the meat dishes may all be a bit salty. Actually, I think most of the vegetables dishes taste pretty good. The chicken soup was pretty good. The other good dish is probably the Peking duck. They don't have the bao for the wrap. Instead, they have the thin mushu wrap. But still, that one was one of the better dish to get. The beef skewers doesn't taste like beef. I think the meat is tenderized and tasted like fatty pork but others thought it was fish. No one in the table ordered it and everyone guess wrong. The beef in chili oil isn't prepared in traditional way, but still pretty good. The seafood fried rice was actually pretty good too. Our waiter, Terry, Â was very helpful and friendly. He helped accommodate our requests and had lots of patiences with it large group. Overall, I think this was still a pretty decent place for food especially when you're trying to accommodate such a large group for dinner.

Andy Y.,/user_details?userid=EOdNt58yKwnqQLe0fJ2ovw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/30/2022,5.0,"Blue Willow is famous for its Mala Dry Pot, and the menu lets you choose what goes into it, which gives you a lot of optionality with protein, vegetables, and overall portion sizes. Along with this, we ordered the salt and pepper prawns. The bar tender who took our order made sure to warn us that the prawns came with the shell. I personally wasn't a fan of eating the prawns with their salt and pepper shells, but it offered an unfamiliar flavor profile that I could appreciate. The dry pot came out promptly afterward, and it was perfectly spicy enough. We ordered the pork belly, fatty beef, bok choy, lotus, potato slices, and enoki mushrooms. For me, the potato slices were the unexpected star of the dish, defusing some of the numbing spice. For two people, we couldn't finish everything, so I took some of the dry pot home to re-cook for the next day's lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jordan W.,/user_details?userid=H4Z_Ltb32c8jmNP5bK92Pg,"Virginia Highland, Atlanta, GA",5/26/2022,5.0,"A hidden gem in midtown, Blue Willow is the spot for Chinese classics in an elevated atmosphere. First of all, the restaurant is gorgeously decorated in a palette of dimly-lit reds and yellow, and is romantic and retro. We didn't get the best table, and were a bit wedged between two noisy parties, but the food more than made up for it. You might expect detached or esoteric dishes here, but Blue Willow delivers the familiar NYC-style Chinese classics. We started with the perfectly tangy and salty cucumber salad and an order of spicy wok-fried green beans. For our entrees, she got the golden yolk tofu, a creamy tofu casserole in an beautifully-pastel yellow egg yolk sauce that reminded me of egg salad in the best way, whereas I had the hard-to-find vegan mapo tofu, which was spicy, saucy, delicious. Our meal, paired with a couple dirty martinis, made for a nice Chinese meal out in NYC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Trendy, hip places always make me skeptical about the food (especially with Asian food) because they can draw people in with their vibes so I guess they can slack on the food but no this place has it all. Also prices are reasonable. Everything was yum but I want to point out the century egg clay pot especially. I am not the biggest fan of century egg on its own because it can be dense and is definitely an acquired taste (I grew up eating it) but I've never had it prepared this way - the server will mash the dish in front of you, it's a cold dish comprised of century egg, eggplant, and some spicy green peppers.

Â The scallion pancakes were decent, calamari was good but the dish was a bit small with 6 pieces of calamari (I liked the peppers mixed in there though!), mapo tofu could have been better, and the big disappointment was the Changsha spiced chicken. Â There were fingernail size pieces of fried chicken (mostly batter though), peanuts and way too many red peppers (they weren't spicy, but the dish was more dried peppers than anything else).

It is located in midtown Manhattan, right next to Central Park. Amid the towering skyscrapers, the restaurant has a cinematic 1920s China style decoration, which creates a unique atmosphere that combines modern and vintage vibes. It serves the best Chinese food I have ever had since I came to the United States. My favorite dish, Mala Dry Pot, has a rich spicy flavor that I thoroughly enjoyed. I have been to many Chinese restaurants, but Blue Willow has the most authentic taste. I strongly recommend this restaurant to Chinese students who miss the taste of home and people who like Chinese food in general. The fact that I went there three times in four days can self-illustrate how good the restaurant is.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Karen C.,/user_details?userid=A3BmfrFtpGHrJpCygh2Tng,"New York, NY",5/31/2022,2.0,"I made reservations ahead given it was Memorial Day and I was really looking forward to returning to Blue Willow... however, it was such a disappointment. We ordered the sweet and sour spare ribs, garlic sauced pork belly, husband & wife special, Qing Hua Jiao fish, and eggplant & beans. The sweet and sour spare ribs dish was such a huge disappointment. The ribs showed up looking like they were just blanched missing the sweet and sour sauce. I've been here before and that's not what the dish looked like during my previous visits or how this should look like anywhere else. I took a bite and immediately spat out the meat. There was no taste except that porky flavor which was not the most pleasant. We told our server about it and he took the dish to the kitchen. Then he came back saying this is how the dish is supposed to look like according to the chef. It was total bullshit and we cancelled that dish. (I'm posting a photo of what it should look like and a photo of what we got for your reference.) The other dishes were alright... they also placed the wrong order for the fish and we got Xiang River Fish instead. We were in and out of the restaurant in 40 mins and didn't want to linger further after such a disappointing meal.

We got a variety of dishes from fried rice to dan dan noodles to string beans. It was indeed super spicy and mala but the yellow beef and frog really stood well.

Stephanie W.,/user_details?userid=YkmMTGQYKt6CcxT19KAbNQ,"New York, NY",5/22/2021,3.0,"I really wanted to like it but everything was mediocre. The restaurant itself is beautiful. It has an old Shanghainese feel to it and the decorations are on point. I had a reservation for a birthday dinner and I brought in a cake beforehand the day of. We got seated in a room and ordered drinks and food. We also checked in to get the chrysanthemum iced tea. For drinks we tried the empress Wu, good fortune, lychee martini, and lost in translation. The drinks were okayyy, some of them were too artificial and some had a interesting blend of flavors. Presentation was better. For food wise we got the numbing beef tendon cold plate, chengdu Dan Dan noodles, chili oil braised beef, eggplant and beans, golden prawn, ma ma peppercorn fish, and mapo tofu. My favorite out of all the dishes was the golden prawn because they have it fried in a egg yolk covering. The dishes were also on the smaller side so this was just right for 6 people. Â The issue came later on when they gave us the check but they charged us for the chrysanthemum tea so we told them and they said they'll take it off and then it took half an hour for the check to come back. In between that time another server came by with the check again and we told them again but this server said we had to write a review on the spot but the other server said it was fine. Then we asked about the cake and they couldn't find it and it took another 20 min for them to bring the cake into the room and left. So waiting for the check and getting it corrected took over half an hr.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/blue-willow-%E5%A4%9C%E6%9D%A5%E6%B9%98-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I think the reviews here are about as valid as reviews on Amazon. Get a bunch of friends to post good things. The service was absolutely horrible. We were informed when we were seated Â that we had a 90 minute limit, which we were fine with, but then it took 20 minutes to take our drink order. We wound up ordering our dinner at the same time since we had had plenty of time to look at the menu and the food for 3 of the 4 of us came quickly, but they totally forgot my son's food and trying to flag someone to remind them to forever. Then it took 20 minutes to bring him his food while ours got cold waiting for his. It was shrimp fried rice which does not take long to cook. I will say his was the tastiest meal. My sesame chicken was average, my daughter's kung pao chicken was tasteless and while my husband's General Tso chicken was spicy as promised, it was super dry. The glass of Sancerre was a half glass.

We had a reservation and were seated promptly but no one came to our table for about 20 minutes other than to give us waters. Finally my husband went up to the bar to order our drinks. Every time we wanted to order something we had to flag down someone to come to our table. We had about 5 different waiters over the course of dinner take our order and drop off food. No one ever greeted us, walked us through the menu, asked if we were ok, how was the food, could they bring us anything else, did we want another drink. It's almost like they forgot about us.

Emily C.,/user_details?userid=6k67PdR-Hi0JBxx3kMjLPg,"Providence, RI",3/30/2022,1.0,"The menu looks incredibly promising, but the food falls so short at Blue Willow. First of all, the food does not come out hot. Every dish we received was lukewarm, and we had to ask for the food to be reheated. Second of all, we ordered the snow pea leaves but they failed to cut off the ends of the vegetables, so the dish was incredibly fibrous and stringy, rendering some pieces inedible. Lastly, the dishes were not well seasoned. The snow pea dish we ordered was too sweet - it almost tasted as if the leaves were soaked in sugar.

The birria tacos (in a part of BK with many great birria options)--in addition to being overpriced, had very little birria flavor and the meat was tough. The kicker: we ordered churros for dessert, and they came out cold and hard as a rock. The waiter actually told us that they were made at the beginning of the dinner shift, then tried to convince us that they are ""supposed to rest for a while"" and be served cold. I told him I lived in Mexico for a while and this was not the case anywhere I had been.

The food is just lacking. The Al pastor tacos were not marinated at all. It wasn't that the marinade wasn't flavorful. There was no marinade. It was cooked pork. The carnitas was ok, it was marinated but was tough and stringy. They do not have salsas, just hot sauces. The aguachiles had not been cured in lime sauce very long at all because the vast majority of the shrimp were still grey. When it has cured in lime juice for even 30 minutes the Â shrimp will turn orange like it does when it is cooked, and the texture hardens similarly as well. This was not the case, and is actually kind of precarious/risky. The tostadas they served with the aguachiles was also stale. They are new so maybe they will make some improvements and changes. But given the quality of restaurants they need to compete against, I wouldn't really recommend this to friends or come back here based on the quality of the food.

Went here for dinner last night and we waited a bit past our reservation time, which is fine on a Saturday night in New York. I'm surprised that no one offered us a drink menu while we waited, but whatever. Let's get to the food... honestly subpar. The gnocchi appetizer was borderline nasty and extremely chewy. The broccoli dish came with 4 pieces of broccoli lol. And the burrata had some strange fish on it. Burrata and fish - not a great combo. I've never not wanted to finish a burrata dish at a restaurant before. The polenta fries were inedible (they took this off our check which is kind, and we didn't ask for them to do that).

Solid advice - please examine your itemized bill. Â They implement false charges and the little saving grace was, they were able to rectify that potent problem without having to escalate the erroneous issue further - in my situation fortunately. The quality of the food was okay ; Definitely not delectably out of this world and not the polar opposite, feces on a platter. Â The ambient concept was suppose to be a ""hip and classy"" vibe but the place provided ""empty energy"" and was a bit vacant and desolate. We couldn't wait to leave - it was just repelling, unwelcoming, unwanted energy. As I finish this review, I also was not encouraged to generously tip as well as I normally do (22-25% in most cases) based on my experience.

There are so many Mediterranean restaurants in the city that can serve as great tasting food as this one. However, this is the one that ruins your experience with their operations, services, and to top it off, with the manager. After our meal, we went through 40 minutes of 5 iterations of bills as they could not figure out the exact charge for our table. And when the manager finally came out, she was extremely arrogant and her first question (not an apology!) was, ""there is only $1 overcharge we did on your check, what is the problem here?"" although this was after their 3rd bill that overcharged 4 more drinks!! So it really did it for us. When she added further to say ""we have 2 servers covering all tables so there can be confusions but this is how all restaurants are nowadays"" we were thrown off at how arrogant and unprofessional she is as a manager. And she asked us to take out our own calculators, yes!! she did!, to confirm her last bill was correct, we were very very upset.

Pork addition is extra $0.75 but wow wow wow... worth every penny. It's not the dry stuff but the melt in your mouth kind of pork stuff that food dreams are made of. Â They sell an okonomiyaki burrito on the menu but you gotta ask for the okonomiyaki; which is not on the menu. I think it's like around $15 bucks but it is worth every succulent morsel of savory goodness. The portion was smaller than i wanted but was just enough to curb the hunger pangs.

I usually go to Otafuku for takoyaki. Dokodemo has a good selection of alcohol. We went with some nigori sake on this cool winter-like day. We started the meal with cabbage and cucumber salad - soy, garlic, bonito flakes. It was simple yet tasty. Â Next we had the 10pc takoyaki which they brought to our table when ready. I was apprehensive about the chunks of onion inside but it turned out to give a nice crunch in contrast with the soft octopus. Shaking shichimi on top help enhance the overall flavor.

I will start by saying the okinomiyaki is delicious and my partner loved it. But it's bittersweet because I used to LOVE the yakisoba but they've changed it since and it's not so good anymore. They don't have enoki mushrooms Â in it anymore and mine was oversauced and the beef was Â a bit tough. I'm sad because I was so excited about Â it.

Jing K.,/user_details?userid=t_O7iyu3Ceqp43hX625qWg,"Manhattan, NY",4/22/2018,3.0,Ordered a pork Okonomi-yaki and Takoyaki. Â Okonomi-yaki has less batter than other places in the area so it's more loosely formed but still has a nice crust on both sides. Â The pork could be crispier but otherwise pretty good. Â The outside of the Takoyaki tasted slightly overdone (little burnt) but also have it a nice crunch when bitten into. Inside was nice and creamy with big chunks of octopus. Â It was topped with a light dusting of bonito flakes instead of a pile of bonito shavings which is custom.

Su C.,/user_details?userid=D3jTqJYRFiFIH1iPPd9LMA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/4/2019,3.0,"A bit disappointing, maybe I was expecting a bit much. I knew it was more like a take out shop without waiting service. The staffs were nice though. I thought the menu was pretty cheap but when we got the food, I had realized it wasn't too quality and wasn't worth it. The takoyaki was nothing unusual, just plain takoyaki that's sold at other Japanese restaurants. Only difference is that you can see them making which is pretty cool. Yakisoba was the one that was really disappointing. I thought it would be really good as I saw them cooking noodles and stir frying with the sauce with freshly cooked noodles right away but it was just so bland with barely any vegetables or other ingredients. It just literally noodles with some sauce stir-fryed. I can see this place being okay for take outs and deliveries but unpicky eaters.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dokodemo-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Also got the 4-piece vegetarian Takoyaki (balled shaped wheat batter, typically filled with vegetables and octopus pieces). It was incredible and the fish flakes were moving due to heat when they first carried the dish out, which we found extremely adorable. They taste amazing too that we ended up adding 4 more Octapus Takoyaki. The garlic cabbage was very flavorful and crisp though not as wow-worthy as other dishes.

I usually stay away from street food because it can so often be super heavy and oily but the okonomiyaki is actually mostly cabbage and though it has a rich taste (esp the pork), it's pretty fresh tasting. The takoyaki was a bit softer than i expected but also fresh. My favorite is the pork okonomiyaki though. You can never go wrong with pork belly. All in all it's around $10 for a medium sized meal.

Jennifer L.,/user_details?userid=UKho4oZWS0I4-rzLrQN77g,"Washington, DC",1/6/2019,1.0,"Terrible. Don't go here if you know that real Japanese okonomiyaki or takoyaki tastes like. I was really craving takoyaki so I checked out this place out and it has high overall ratings so I was excited. Should have trusted the mixed reviews though. I came to the front of the store to see the menu and was unpleasantly surprised to see that they allowed customization for takoyaki. They ask to choose between octopus or chicken and make the takoyaki regular or spicy. It's called TAKOyaki for christ's sake, tako means octopus! Also I have never heard of spicy takoyaki. I really should have turned around at this point, but since I came all the way here, decided to give it a shot. I ordered only takoyaki and took a seat. It took a while, but I didn't mind because I know it takes a while. Finally got my food, and was unhappy that that had only a little bit of very small sized bonito flakes. It smelled fine though. So I'm excited, grab my chopsticks and pick one it. I immediately notice how mushy it is and the poor thing is starting to fall apart as I'm holding it. I eat it anyway, and I'm immediately shocked that there is something crunchy in it. In disbelief, I inspect another one and see that there is undercooked cabbage chunks in there... why?!?! Other than picked ginger or scallion, there should be no other vegetables! Especially not something so intrusive and texture ruining as crunchy cabbage. Takoyaki is supposed to be a delicately crispy, warm, and gooey savory ball of octopus goodness. I was so disappointed. On top of that, there were only 1-2 small chunks of overcooked octopus. Really, no matter how much you're craving takoyaki, don't come here. A good ramen restaurant that DOES NOT specialize in teppanyaki and happens to carry takoyaki should be much, much better. This is NOT AUTHENTIC, please don't get fooled. The only upside of trying out this place is that now I know not to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dokodemo-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

In search of high quality olive oils, I decided to check out Despana and I am so glad I found this gem! I walked inside having no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised at the selection, quality of products, and service. The kind gentleman explained the different olive oils while I perused their selection. They also had a good variety of cured sausages/meats and pretty much anything needed for a fine charcuterie board or specialities from Spain. I took a chance on purchasing a bottle of olive oil without trying it and the only thing I regret was not purchasing more products.

Instead, I'm pretty sure I was served boxed kraft macaroni. And a very stingy portion of seafood (2 shrimp, 2 mussels). Flavor wise, it need salt and pepper.

I really enjoyed the selection of cheese and meat. We lucked out and managed to get seats immediately but I would probably try to come again during downtime instead. It's also not a great place for a large group.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/despa%C3%B1a-fine-foods-and-tapas-cafe-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Â Nothing out of the ordinary and you can really taste the spices in the chorizo which was a bit cold in the middle but charred on the outside.

Tara P.,/user_details?userid=ooECKe3GAwAOW9O5Tu1aQQ,"Manhattan, NY",10/4/2014,4.0,"Love this place. Â I had goat cheese on toasted pan with caramelized onions, jamon iberico, gazpacho and blood sausage. Everything I have tried is pretty amazing. The jamon is extremely pricey but worth it. Service is polite if a bit quiet because of the language barrier (they all speak spanish). The new sommelier wine consultant is a wizard. She picked out an amazing bottle of red based on our preferences. Full body, not too tannic, fruit but dry. She gave us the background on the wine...It came from grape vines that were over 200 years old and untouched by phylloxera so they were gnarly and beautiful. It was amazing. And, I love sitting in the back surrounded by cool marble. A quiet little oasis amidst the bustle. The wines are $10+.

If it's convenient, go a couple blocks to Balthazar's Bakery and get a loaf of french bread, if not, don't worry. Now find a park, bench, or go to the pop up park on Mulberry.

If you love good Spanish food, tapas the the like you'll be seventh heaven at this smartly stocked market cum cafe serving the best of the Iberian peninsula. I stumbled upon it and once inside knew I had struck a gold mine of good things to nosh on. I'm not the only smart savvy New Yorker who knows good food in this food-obsessed city of ours [sorry San Francisco, this is the real deal]. Prices skew high but not stratospheric and there's something for everyone to like. Often they have some cheeses and meats on sample and if that won't get you to open your wallet, something else will. I personally could camp out here and eat until they closed - it's that good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/despa%C3%B1a-fine-foods-and-tapas-cafe-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I finally found the tables all the way in the back, along with the menu. First thought was, so many choices to choose from. What do i choose? Tortilla & idiazabal and chorizo in apple cider was the first things that I ordered. It was sort of a potato cheese with cured ham mini sandwich. It was quite a treat especially the chorizo . This made me quickly go back to the counter to order more things. Next up was Quijote. If there's anything to try this is it. Dry cured pork loin (lomo) with Manchego cheese and quince spread. Wow!!

Â I have been coming here to procure items that my wife (she is from Spain) enjoys. Â However, the service is terrible. Â We wanted to have a sandwich but having experienced the abysmal portion sizes and inferior quality of meats and condiments used in the sandwich on previous occasions, we thought this time we would buy the meats and things we wanted separately and make our own sandwhich. Â I told this to the main manager and he said we could not eat the sandwich which was completely bought (meat and breads) from their store neither there nor could we eat it outside the store. A hispanic woman comes over and starts complaining in spanish that if we are thinking of eating that sandwich in the store we cannot and on and on for 5 minutes until my wife interrupted the constant back and forth since she understands Spanish and said we had already said we are not eating the sandwich in the store I think I am allowed to buy the meats separately to make a sandwich right?! then she was like playing dumb and said ""Oh I don't know I don't Â know I don't speak english"" and left. Â then the guy started complaining that he could not find his carving knife and made a big stink of complaining of having to slice the meat for us. Â After having bought the bread and all the stuffings which again was really not much more in terms of portion size for 40 dollars we asked if he could use the knife to slice the bread in half and he said he could not do that. Â We asked if we could use a knife he said no, we asked if his kitchen staff could cut it in half he said they are too busy. Â There was another couple standing next to us and one couple already eating and he is saying the kitchen staff is too busy to slice a piece of bread in half so we could eat it in the park. Â The items or overpriced the quality of the products has gone down and the service is horrible. Â If more people in spain have that kind of attitude toward service then it is no wonder Spain's economy is in the state it is.

Â We spent almost $200, She brought us the check after 45 minutes, telling us that this was the time limit to be in the restaurant. Â She practically ran us off saying that they needed the table, the saddest thing is that the restaurant was empty, there were only 2 occupied tables counting mine. Â We hadn't even finished eating, and we thought we'd order something extra btw the tip was already included in the check (18%) for a terrible service.

Sashanna W.,/user_details?userid=qdLC5NnCL4twv840FjtlYA,"Queens, NY",3/2/2020,4.0,"Ventured out on a Sunday evening to this new neighborhood joint for a quick dinner. This evening getting a table was relatively easy as the place was only about a third of the way packed. I can see this not being the case in the summer time. I had a frozen passion fruit margarita. My friend had a whiskey sour. Both drinks were well made. I ordered the pork tacos and he had pork burritos. Â The tacos Â were good- though a little on the small side. I do want to note that I did not leave there hungry but if you're used to more food order the burrito. It was definitely a nice size. There is a parking lot next door- though whether it belongs to the restaurant or the neighboring establishment I'm not quite sure. The ambience is very ""Mexican Restaraunt"" but I love it. I think this will be a great hang out especially in the summer. The prices were reasonable. They except cash and credit. Ill definitely be back.

Drink menu was a little scary so I stuck to my favorite- vodka with cranberry. Yours was the best I've had in the neighborhood but $13 is a little steep for Myrtle Ave. Waitress did not know how must of the items on the menu were prepared or what they were for that matter. She was however very polite. I concur with the other reviewer that the entrees Â are not for sharing however I ate less than half of my arroz chaufa and wanted to take the rest home and was told you didn't have any take home containers because you were only opened for two weeks and after my insistence she had it packed and explained that the establishment didn't want to give the impression that it was a take out restaurant, huh?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantina-33-ridgewood?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

If you dont want to decide on one you can mix two of them up, we chose asparagus and beef and could not be any happier we did that.

The drinks were also on point. We had the frozen sangrita and the pisco sangria and they were delicious! For dessert we shared the dulce de tres leche and it was also really good.

Jin C.,/user_details?userid=9G8EyOAEv5mfSOdsbrIF7A,"New York, NY",10/11/2020,5.0,"Simple Italian food done well, with just a touch of modernity. All of the dishes I had were well-balanced with complementary flavors and textures. I had the watercress and pear salad with crispy prosciutto - the prosciutto was a fancier version of bacon bits, which I enjoyed. I also liked the burratina salad with jammy figs, walnuts, maple and an unexpected hit of jalapeÃ±o. The pasta was the star of dinner: the strozzapreti pasta was just a little chewy, with these little divots that held the bolognese sauce well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aita-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We shared the pumpkin and pear soup which was good but the pepper overshadowed the more subtle flavors of the fruits, the octopus and pickled vegetables salad which offered a wonderful contrast between the tender grilled meat and the briny pickles, and the pappardelle with wild boar ragu which was delicious and not overly gamey.

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. The brunch here is very good. I ordered the 2 scrambled eggs, with bacon, potatoes and a pancake and this meal had wonderful flavors. Everything was coked the way I like it. The pancake (my absolute favorite thing in the world) was very tasty. They definitely know how to make a blueberry pancake here. The prices are pretty moderate, but I do feel that the portion was a bit small. You only get one pancake which is more of the silver dollar variety and you barely get any potatoes. Granted I was able to overlook this because it tasted good, but I like to leave a pace satisfied, not looking for something else to eat in another hour. Most places either give you way too much or not enough at all and Aita unfortunately falls in the latter category. Another small gripe was the bacon; it was a bit overcooked which kind of sucked, but again a very small thing. All in all a pretty good place.

A bit of bacon or pancetta would have maybe made up some of this ground? My girlfriend had the waffles with apple. She said the waffles were really good but the smoked apple was kinda weird. Would like to come back and try other things! The only slightly off putting stuff was some of the plants were dying and some of the waitstaff were dressed formally and others were very casual.

Our server was very attentive, too. It's a quiet, charming atmosphere in a cozy townhome on a cobble street in Brooklyn. It should be a destination, and definitely worth a trip from Manhattan or elsewhere. The tasting menu at $95 was a good value but the dishes can be ordered off the menu too.

I personally really liked the Gnocchi and Beef Wrap, but didn't find the Tonton Hot Pot to be very special. If I ever come again, I'd focus more on the small plates/appetizers. It's pretty pricey, but I'd say average for any place here in Midtown. The Gnocchi had a really strong mentaiko and sweet taste. And what I loved about the Yakiniku Wrap was that the wrap (similar to Chinese scallion pancakes) wasn't soggy as all. The Tonton Hot Pot is a good level of spice, but felt the portion was really small for the price. And, there wasn't anything impressive in the hot pot itself.

We also got the Goma Hamachi, which was a beautifully presented dish with tender and flavorful sesame yellowtail. The service was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was cozy and inviting.

We didn't have reservations so just opted to sit at the bar, which worked out since we weren't getting hotpot. Service was fast and efficient. We just wanted a quick bite, so opted to try a few of the app plates. We ended up ordering the citrus salmon, pepper chicken, roast beef rolls, and garlic pork belly. Everything arrived fairly quickly, portion sizes were good for sharing with 2 people max. I loved the brightness of the salmon citrus, that was my fave dish, especially with the roe! Second fave was the pork belly, you can't go wrong with either flavor. They have a nice assortment of specialty cocktails, along with beer and liquor, which we did not indulge in tonight but good to know for options.

I was a fan of Hakata TonTon when it used to be downtown. I'm glad they opened a location in midtown since it's now near my work. We shared the pepper wings, the small Tonton hot pot (spicy miso broth, chicken thigh, pork feet, pork belly, dumplings, tofu, vegetables), and the green tea tofu dessert. The wings were crispy and the black sesame gave it a good crunch. The small hot pot was a good portion for two people. The broth was flavorful and had a good kick to it. My only gripe was that there were only two small dumplings and I wanted more haha. The green tea tofu dessert was the best dish. The tofu was so silky and definitely tasted homemade.

We were also delighted that the original chef Chef Koji Hagihara has returned. We went opening weekend and he was there smiling and checking in with all the tables. All the staff were very friendly and seemed so happy to be back. The new space is a bit larger and more modern with more seating and a modern spacious ambiance. The menu includes about half old favorites and half new items with some improvements to old favorites as well. Everything was amazing as always! I missed the seaweed salad and salmon or tuna carpaccio but the Goma Hamachi, which was mixed table side, was my new favorite dish. The tonton hotpot was amazing as always, perfectly spiced melding of flavors and the pork and gelatinous cartilage melts in your mouth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/hakata-tonton-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Eunice L.,/user_details?userid=G-UYgeC5i2lJsQ9SGrLmyw,"Queens, Queens, NY",10/29/2022,4.0,"It was okay. The service was nice of course but food is a little pricy. Ordered the soup, uni scallop which was great and the truffle potato. Wanted to take out some food but since they don't have containers they don't do take outs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/hakata-tonton-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Koli S.,/user_details?userid=jDuI1ZfBxcL5iWEJOWK89w,"Cromwell, CT",12/7/2019,4.0,Great burgers on the top floor of 55 Water Street - it hit the spot. Â Also a great spot to grab drinks after working out and just a floor or two above the office. Â So glad they put this spot in! Â Hoping it continues to bring tourists and sightseers!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/david-burke-timeout-market-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
