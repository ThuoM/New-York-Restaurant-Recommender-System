We arrived on a Friday night around 6:30 and we had made a reservation at 6 and the place was empty. We got great seating and pretty good food ( the fries are deliciously seasoned). My one complaint is how crumbly the burger was but that could've been my own fault for opting to not get the cheese (which was probably the glue that would hold it together). Besides the crumbly burger it was still good and our drinks were great! Loved the fun names.

Marissa C.,/user_details?userid=_paclj39JIG8yWCHxwf2ag,"Bensalem, PA",11/5/2021,3.0,Food was decent. Dessert was amazing and service was very good. The bathroom was about 90 degrees. The music was a bit loud for my taste.  We had the blackened chicken which was way too peppery for me. The Brussel sprouts tasted like they had just been heated up from frozen. Definitely not fresh. Also had the pot pie which was huge. I wish the chicken was more evenly dispersed. The cookie skillet was the star of the show. Very gooey and a wonderful size to split. The ice cream came in a separate cup so that it didn't get all melts on the cookie.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There was a 45-minute wait for a table, but we found two seats at the bar and that was plenty spacious for our needs. We ordered and shared an avocado toast, which came with two eggs and a salad (honestly, that's enough for two people if you're not looking to roll out, the portions are that generous).

Canny F.,/user_details?userid=UKU5x7fgNWzzdpCh3PqS0A,"Brooklyn, NY",12/17/2016,3.0,I loved the interior wood theme so I scheduled a cmb brunch date and I scored a table near the window. It was a fun seat! I ordered the veggie burger with cheddar grits. The veggie burger tasted better without the bun. The bun was too big and just added unnecessary carbs to my breakfast. The patty was more on the dry side so I was hesitant to let my date try my burger because I didn't want his first experience with a veggie burger to suck. He tried it and wasn't so fond of it. He had the steak and eggs and enjoyed his meal a great deal. How were these grits? Better than my first experience with cheesy grits in NYC but still not comparable to southern cheesy grits. I'm not sure what the south does to their grits but those are something to crave for.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was actually attending a NYFW show and had about another hour and a half for the next one. It was raining and I was hungry so I decided to pull up OpenTable and look for restaurants in the area. By the photos and the menu, I chose Boulton & Watt and I'm so glad that I did. We made a quick reservation and when we arrived, the Hostess greatly sat us at a table and we were SHOCKED to see how incredibly crowded it was in the middle of a Saturday. We ordered from the Brunch Menu and absolutely LOVED the food! The drinks were amazing the food was delicious! The decor is so cool and even the bathroom was unique! Although it was crowded, it wasn't an issue at all. I was even told by another customer that it's usually twice as crowded & I see why...

The corner restaurant with all open windows, cool interior decor, outdoor seating and awesome waitstaff complement the amazing food. The rosé sangria was awesome and perfect for summer. The Mac and cheese with bacon was perfection and the stone ground cheese grits rival anything in the south (and I live in the south and eat grits weekly and it is my favorite starchy side).

Came in here on a Friday night with a large group of 15 for dinner/drinks after watching a play. The ambience was cool but very very loud. Hard to speak to the person across from you. They were very busy when we got there. From their creative menu, I was in between ordering the veggie burger or duck confit carbonara. Needless to say, I should have ordered the veggie burger. The duck was so salty I couldn't even eat it. I ended up eating around it but even the pasta was lacking creaminess. Not a fan at all. My coworkers nicely gave me half of her veggie burger which was delicious! (Dammit I should have gotten that!). Their fries had a weird perfumy after taste. My friend ordered the steak frites and the steak was lacking major flavor. Pricey place too. Overall it was kind of a let down.

Justin Bieber to Bruce Springsteen to Lady Gaga to U2 is a very strange mix.

As the weather was in the mid 80s outdoor seating was a plus! Good menu selection. I decided to go with bacon and gritz. It has a weird name & typically comes with sausage. It was really good except I did not enjoy the reddish sauce. It tasted a bit curry like- a tad spicy. My bday had the French toast. The flavor was delightful but the texture was not for either of us. Way to gooy and slimmy. The brunch cocktails are only $6. Huge cups of coffee. The waitstaff were friendly- even left my cc behind and went back to retrieve it without a hassle. I would prob try it out for happy hour and dinner.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jillian W.,/user_details?userid=sJygpLWR4IZB73J1SvVJzw,"Pittsburgh, PA",3/2/2018,5.0,"I stumbled upon this place for a Saturday brunch. It has a nice atmosphere and friendly waitstaff. We both were in the mood for something both savory and sweet, so we decided to split two entrees. We split the spinach & sriracha egg benedict as well as an order of the french toast. Both dishes were delicious. For drinks, I tried a citrus beer and my friend had a mimosa. Unfortunately, our table was wobbly and our drinks spelt quite often. However, we informed our waiter of this and the manager came over and removed the drinks from our bill. Great customer service!

My only criticism would be the milk being served in a small pitcher.  We poured a little milk on the cookie and it ruined it by making it soggy and sopping up the flavor.  I think the milk is best drank on the side, but maybe that's just me.  The bartender was busy, flying around making cocktails and such so we can't really comment on service either although it appeared he had things under control.  The menu looks delicious.  I want to come back and try the food!  Cool, industrial vibe, too.  Very on-trend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Multiple times throughout our meal he made unnecessary comments and rolled his eyes throughout serving us.

For lunch they have happy hour specials, I was going to get a carafe but the waiter was kind enough to tell me it's cheaper to get a $6 glass of wine, which you never hear a waiter helping you out with prices. My boyfriend got a special: you get a sandwich, picked jar & a cold beer for $16, when we actually were only charged $15 for (I think because they didn't have the beer he wanted).

So I walk over to bouncer 3 a Hispanic guy who immediately gives me attitude and says he doesn't want to talk and if I want my ID to call the cops. I do and of course there busy with really problems and send me to a different help line that gave me a dial tone. After 20 mins bouncer 3 who has been nothing but rude says hey I don't have your ID. So I go bad to bouncer 2 the woman and she's trying to give be some crap that she's not allowed to give me ID back. FINALLY another guy who I assume was the manager comes out and hands me my ID and says here just leave. Well I know that was a lot but just know that this place for the most part has crap bouncers that will try and show there power by acting like jerks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We had the fried calamari and it was without a doubt the best I've ever had. Served immediately to us, piping hot (one thing I'll say is they don't let the food sit around cooling off before they bring it to you) and delicious. I had the blackened brick chicken with the mashed potatoes/Brussels sprouts, a delicious comforting plate. Which I needed because the staff was so chilly and the noise in the place was so bad I literally felt like I was dining alone. Any attempt at conversation was impossible, so I recommend trying to get seating directly next to your companion as opposed to across from. I might go back again as the food was pretty good, but I'll steer clear of the witchy hostess stand and seat myself at a bar table.

The food is pretty darn good - my friend got a beef burger last night and I got the veggie. I'm always hesitant with the veggie - I've had very good and very very bad, but this falls into the good category. It's topped with tzatziki sauce which is CLUTCH. The fries are to die for.

They could definitely learn hospitality from Boulton & Watt. Went there yesterday, Thursdays night. Place was busy but i still could find a place at the spacious bar. Bartender was very attentive and made great beer suggestions. When food arrived i was kinda disappointed. Octopus was chewy and when i asked a bartender if i can send it back, within 5 seconds i had owner/manager talking to me. They apologized and quickly substitute it for a great tuna tartare. Guys did a great job including the fact it was happening after kitchen closed and i really hate to be ""THAT table"". I work in a kitchen myself so i know how staff feel about last second orders. Also they were super generous and gave us a round of beers. It was a great ""going out"" experience, we left in a great mood and definitely will be back soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/boulton-and-watt-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They also have one of the best wait staffs in town. Save room for one of their delicious creative desserts.

Saad M.,/user_details?userid=LZUCXm19nVXhFaSU7IfmNw,"Manhattan, NY",1/8/2014,3.0,"This is a classy establishment on the border of Alphabet City, East Village, and Lower East Side. The decor is classy, reminiscent of The Wren or Wilfie and Nell. Refurbished wood and industrial steel set the mood, and the conversation level is usually at a medium din, louder on weekend nights. Came here for a burger and drinks with a friend...the fries were uneven. Half were crispy, the other half soggy with the right amount of seasoning on them. The burger was also pedestrian for the neighborhoods standards. The bun was a bit ....damp...if that is the correct word. Also the meat was prepared as asked however was devoid of any flavor really. Service at the bar was spotty with about 5 people there but the bartender only checking in on us after we stood up and started getting dressed to leave. Another minor caveat that I had was that my drink tab was less than the $10 credit card minimum which they didn't tell me until after my friend already paid. First, these minimums are technically illegal in NYC and secondly if there was such a minimum we should have been told that so we could have combined our tabs. Put a damper on the end of a night.

Katie E.,/user_details?userid=6V-2xBztMnO2Rk7pKKYdPQ,"New York, NY",7/14/2014,1.0,"As much as I would like to promote Boulton & Watt, I won't do it because of a poor experience that I had when it first opened. I have lived in the surrounding neighborhood for years and wanted to bring business to this establishment when it first opened. I used to run a happy hour once a week with a bunch of co-workers and friends. We work in the finance industry and are always happy to get out and spend a little bit to have a good time. We were also combining charity donations along with our drinking fun. I contacted the manager, Jaime, and explained that we were interested in hosting a happy hour at Boulton & Watt and wanted to know if they had any interest in contributing a small percentage of our final bill to a fundraiser that we were running for homeless youth in NYC. He was very enthusiastic and committed to it over email and then I stopped by the bar to introduce myself. I promoted the happy hour(s) and fundraiser to everyone and brought a rather large group that evening after work. We had a nice table in the corner near the window. The other people stood near the bar and we had a nice time ordering both food and drinks. People weren't shy to order more because they knew that a percentage was going to charity. Jaime and I had agreed to take a look at the final amount of the bill at the end of the night and he would donate a percentage based on the amount. At the end of the night, he was no where to be found and the bartender advised that he left for the night.  I emailed, called, and stopped in a few days later but he stayed out of sight and dodged my emails and calls. It was unprofessional and left me with a sour taste of the place. Since then, our firm has not done any happy hours or business with Boulton & Watt. We never ended up getting any type of small charity donation for our endeavor. I walk by it very often but will not stop in. It's unfortunate.

So nice to eat somewhere for brunch that has relatively healthy, meatless options that extend beyond yogurt and granola, so thank you! I think they just opened for brunch and are still working out the service kinks.. there weren't that many people in there and the busser had a hovering issue, which is annoying when you are trying to just chill out with your eggs and your hangover. There's also a pretty bad beer smell, but it's a bar so what can you do. It will be really nice in the spring when they open up those windows.

The coconut curry was tasty and went well with the mussels-there was enough of the sauce that it could be drunk as a soup or sopped up with the abundant shredded bread pieces. The fries were nice and thick. Brussels sprouts were also good. My apple crisp salad was almost exclusively lettuce- barely any of the apples, nuts or cheese advertised.

Dhara J.,/user_details?userid=bEXtBenbCGae5YPIPJ2B6g,"Raleigh, NC",1/9/2020,5.0,"We decided to come here for our NYE. I'm so happy we did. In our ""old age"" my husband and I (as well as our friends) wanted to make sure we had a low key night where we could talk and have a place to sit while bringing in the new year. Our friend found this place and picked it due it having a live band that night. It was great! They played a nice mix of jazz and instrumental versions of famous/ classic rock songs. The service was amazing! We had a couple of rounds of mixed drinks as well as a flight of whiskey for tasting. They do know how to make a great drink. I loved my bourbon peach iced tea the best! We had some small bites to eat after the clock rang 12- deviled eggs and some fries. The fries were great! They came with 3 different types of sauces and they were all delicious. I'd love to come here on a random night as well to just hang out. The seats were comfy and the service kept us comfortable too.

We ordered the coconut curry mussels and octopus for appetizers. The curry was truly exceptional, and I loved that they threw in some freshly toasted bread cubes to soak up some of the sauce. The broiled duck flatbread was also delicious, and a perfect portion size. The family members I was with both got a salad with chicken. They were substantial. The margarita I got was also quite tasty, I enjoyed the combo of jalapeño heat with blood orange flavor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/white-oak-tavern-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Coincidence that three of us starting throwing up within hours of each other after we ate the same exact thing at brunch? I think not! We had no other interactions before/after together that could be the culprit. Wanted to love this place, it was cute, the food was delicious at the time, and we enjoyed our brunch, but man the afterwards was soooo not worth it. I had to pay a lot of money to change a flight I had scheduled, because I physically could not get on an airplane the next day as I could not stop throwing up for a full day after I ate here.

It is a block and a half away from Washington Square Park, which is great for people who are visiting NYU and are searching for great food. I had the caesar salad with grilled chicken to start and the fried chicken with scallion waffles and kimchi... an asian fusion of one of my favorite American classics. The food was quite tasty and a decent-sized portion. The restaurant has a very homey vibe with antique-like furniture, woodwork and thick curtains on the windows. The only thing I have to comment on is the slow service and treacherous walk down to the bathroom... a very steep flight of stairs.

It was a beautiful rustic vibe put me in the mind of the show Cheers but dimmer with Christmas decorations. The host was pleasant I didn't need a reservation walked right in and was able to sit. The entire menu looked pretty good I had the chicken pot pie and it was beautiful my only con about it was that the chicken pieces were to large but other than that really no complaints. My sister had bangers & mash which was like a pork sausage in an onion jus with mash potatoes it was also amazing. It was comfort food perfect for a brisk evening. The cocktails were great the one that caught my eye was the rosé sangria and I like it my sister had the Peach Iced Tea with Bourbon it had more of a smoky taste to it not your traditional spiked tea but still good. They offered us dessert unfortunately we didn't take them up on the offer but I'm sure it's just as good as the main course. I may go back tomorrow to try the Brussels that we kept smelling!

The bread was thick and crunchy and filled with leeks, pickled jalapeño, fontina and gruyere cheeses, and tomatoes. It also came with a piquillo dip that added another dimension to this already mouth watering sandwich. Since this place is also known for their whiskey, I had the peach bourbon iced tea which was a combination of Jim beam, peach puree, and lemon iced tea.

Mark Y.,/user_details?userid=-s7_ngz2hlEWfR5b4HSGow,"Oxon Hill, MD",8/8/2019,2.0,"Went to White oak today for lunch sat at a window table, had a party of three people. Was greeted by a manager or host at the front door pretty sure it was a manager. Made a few simple jokes with her to break the ice and was seated. Server came over took the order. But she made no suggestions. Seemed very unenthusiastic to be there. Never came back to the table to refill any drinks. Did not ask how the food was. Manager stood in front of table over looking the dining room which wasn't many customers. Stood so close to the table but never turned around to ask can I get you a refill or how is the food. Saw her roll her eyes but not an ounce of service in this staff which was minimal. Two women and a buss boy and a food runner. Waitress never smiled, engaged in no conversation, basically took order and dropped check. Felt like for an 80.00 lunch the two ladies could care less if we were there. Will applaud the chef food was excellent but the front of the house needs some serious John Taffer improvement.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/white-oak-tavern-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We love this area as it is slightly off the beat and track and a quieter place around NYU. We asked for the salted caramel sundae as a sweet end to our meal. They were out of the said ice cream, but they brought out a delicious sundae of vanilla ice cream with caramel and chocolate sauce. It was yummy. We decided to return for Mother's day and try dinner, well what a disappointment. I ordered the flat bread pizza. For 13.00 I got a 5x3 flat bread with sauce and a dribble of buratta, here and there. I mean, where was the cheese? My family found their meal ok. We ordered the Salted Caramel ice cream sundae again and that was completely different. A schmear of an icing like chocolate around the middle of the bowl, the ice cream plopped in the center and a sprinkle of popcorn on top. That was no Sundae. Sorry to say, we will not be returning.

I'm not a bangers n mash fan but my bf was pretty happy with it. Of all things the mac and cheese was the biggest disappointment. It was extremely bland. Also the Brussels sprouts were super good BUT also drowning in whatever oil was in the sauce. Overall it was a decent meal and what we were looking for at the time.

Shirley S.,/user_details?userid=WYRjkr51WybVe1pIOBkokg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/22/2019,3.0,"On Monday evening, 7/22, between 7 and 8:30 p.m., on a VERY rainy night, my umbrella was lifted by someone leaving the White Oak Tavern. It is a unique umbrella: Sage green background, pink flowers scattered about (like Old English wallpaper) with a curved, blond wood handle. Thing is, I'm 86 years old and need to use a rollator-walker, and that was the ONLY umbrella I can use--long enough to hold while allowing me to grasp the walker; a curved handle making it easier to hold onto walker. IF YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOOK IT, PLEASE RETURN IT TO THE WHITE OAK. No questions asked. This was no accident. Yes, it was raining, but if you needed an umbrella there was a selection of ORDINARY ones there. This one is special; I got it in London 15 years ago, and it's the ONLY umbrella I can use now. Oh yeah, I'm a regular at the White Oak, so obviously I like the food, the ambiance & all. Until tonight, that is.

My cousins decided to take me here, and I was so happy that they did! We instantly ordered and got the beef platter. This came with kalbi/prime ribeye/beef thin skirt/ and beef brisket. The thing I liked about this place was that they do the work for you, they constantly come around and check the grill, flip the meat and make sure it's cooked to perfection, and constantly asking if anything else was needed. The meat was delicious. They also brought sides of kimchi, pickled onions, pickled lettuce, fried egg cooking in a pot with some sesame oil, salad, and tofu soup. They also have an array of sauces!!!

The staff cook all of the meat for you based on your preferred cook. They cut it up into easy to eat pieces and give you space to eat one thing at a time.

Really felt like we were in Korea. Not really ... but it was fun to pretend. The food was pretty good too. A little overpriced, but I find that most Asian BBQs are a little overpriced. Like, why is that?! Pay more ... to cook your own food. LOL!!! Doesn't make sense. Anyway, this place was pretty yummy and moderate in the price category. Our server was extremely friendly, and she helped cook our food for us at the table ... which I appreciated. We ordered some beef special for 2. I forget what it was called, but it was plenty of food ... if not too much. It came with a lot of Korean side dishes. All of them very good. We also ordered some drinks. I got a beer/soju cocktail which was not the classiest but exactly what so wanted. All in all, it was a good experience.

For side dishes, you get a bowl of steamed egg (my husband's favourite) and some sort of stew (yay for freebies). In terms of the actual bbq, the meat were super tender and flavourful. Very rarely, did I find pieces of meat that were too tough to chew. The atmosphere is great in this restaurant, but definitely could be too loud for couples who want a ""romantic"" date.

We got seated at a booth with a ventilation that comes down to suck up the smoke, which is nice. They even cook the meats for ya, which is awesome because they know how to best cook it. We ordered the large beef platter to feed four, and we had to order a soup and extra order of brisket to fill us. All the meats were QUALITY,  and so delicious. It was so soft and juicy in all bites!

Sat in the 5th floor restaurant where they do not serve alcohol but we went for a family dinner so we did not drink anyway. Pork belly and boneless short ribs were delicious, as was the seafood pancake. Other reviews had found it to be too thick but we thought it was nice, thin and crispy (but not too thin to have a good bite). Banchan here was just ok in my opinion. Other places like CDG have more variety vs jongro only having non-spicy kimchi, pickled radish, one steamed egg for our table of 6, scallion/chives, and pickled jalapeno. Would've liked to see salted fish, blanched veggies, sweet potato salad, spicy kimchi, etc. Service once we ordered was good, but getting someone's attention to order took a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/jongro-bbq-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Compared with AYCE, this was really quality meat and you could definitely tell the difference. I would say 2 platters was about enough to fill a group of 4, not to the brim, but AYCE vs more premium kbbq cuts are just a different experience. The best was probably the kalbi on the beef platter.

Grace K.,/user_details?userid=bn-BQoKoFUJqNN_qRDeUkw,"WHITESTONE, NY",10/5/2022,5.0,"Jongro BBQ delivers quite satisfactory Korean BBQ. We got an order of the pork belly and the bulgogi - which was plenty for 2 people. The banchan was limited compared to other restaurant but of good quality and more than satisfactory. I was surprised that we didn't get a basket of lettuce but instead two types of salads - which actually worked to complement the meat. The steamed egg dish was also quite good - steamed at the table and not too salty. The pork belly was excellent. The bulgogi was cooked with some broth, noodles and vegetables - which I wasn't expecting but actually was great on a rainy evening. We ordered a side of rice. The service was quick and efficient, and we didn't have to wait long - albeit it was a weekday late evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/jongro-bbq-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We also got the pork short rib, which were marinated and incredibly flavorful. All the sides provided are fresh & delicious. The steamed egg is my favorite, don't be shy to try it if you haven't before! Also, I highly recommend trying their Yuzu Spiked Seltzer, I will be searching everywhere to find it in stores!

At first I was a little nervous since it didn't seem like they took reservations but luckily they were able to accommodate us right away. Without having to wait to be seated and immediately being able to order the meats it was such a good experience. They cook everything for you which is amazing - you don't have to be afraid of your one friend who somehow manages to burn everything they cook. Juicy, tender, with your own preference of seasoning there is absolutely nothing to dislike about the meat selection at Jongro BBQ. Even the soondubu they provide on the side wasn't overwhelmingly spicy but still held good kimchi and veggie flavor - wish they gave more than just one bowl :') . The only downside is even with vents to pull the air you still end up leaving with your clothes smelling heavily of bbq meat, so definitely not the place to wear your fanciest attire.

Camille M.,/user_details?userid=kFO8Aji0fQMP2lJKps4YwQ,"New York, NY",10/13/2022,5.0,"If you want amazing KBBQ, Jongro is where it's at!!!!! Jongro is literally my boyfriend and I favorite restaurant in all of NYC! We have tried majority of the famous KBBQ in nyc including the michelin KBBQ but to be honest Jongro just can not be beat!!!! It's absolutely delicious. Our favorite is the USDA Marinated Kalbi. But we usually get the platters. We come here pretty much once or twice every month! We can't help it. We come here so often we notice changes in the menu. They recently did a price hike which sucks but understandable because of inflation. We still come and pay for it so clearly it's worth it. We love our platter but also love the lychee cocktail and the mango beer bomb. What is annoying is that when we bring our underage siblings here, since they are not 21 no one on the table can have a drink. But like they were not going to drink any way? Just the adults? But still no alcohol allowed. Really weird and annoying. But whatever we come here for the food and not the alcohol. I love love love the macaroni and the egg too. The spicy rice cake is great but a little spicy for me. The side dishes are so delicious too with the meats. We literally bring all our friends who come visit NYC here and they are NEVER disappointed. Like ever. And neither are we! We come to jongro to be happy whether because we have a celebration or we're having a bad day and need some cheering up. Jongro is the best way for Diego and I to get happy. Our friends are so sick of seeing my instagram story of Jongro because we are here literally every month!! Been to jongro probably almost 20 times in less than 2 years!! We need a stamp card because we absolutely love this place. I'm telling you it's the best. If the line is long that's okay just walk around ktown get a boba and a corn dog and then eat at jongro after. That's our usual routine! We also love the Gopchang in the 5th floor. My boyfriend is Colombian and he lovesssss it too!! Gopchang is def a different more adventurous kbbq but man jongro does it so well. The 2nd floor is definitely the original and the best to try.

The quality of the meat was undoubtably superior to your local all you can eat kbbq but lacked a little flavor wise. The marinated galbi was very mild and defeated the purpose of getting the marinated version. The prime ribeye was a bit tough and not worth it imo. The downside is when the staff cooks it for you, some of them do not know when to flip and when to cut. Our meat ended up being a bit more overcooked than we liked.

Steve L.,/user_details?userid=qU0aHVWkRUnr0K1w3w3p5g,"Philadelphia, PA",9/9/2021,4.0,Come here for kbbq often and it has not let me down yet. You must get the beef tartare. It is raw beef served chilled with an egg yolk mixed in. The description may sound odd for some but you will not regret it if you try it. The service is good and they will cook the meats for you on the grill if you need help. The prices are bit steep but the meat is quality. They don't have lettuce for you to make wraps which is a disappointment. Otherwise this is my go to kbbq when I am in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/jongro-bbq-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Menu was difficult to understand and definitely on the pricey side. Staff was not communicative leaving my group of 5 confused on what to do next. The music in the place was very loud, not a place you should go if you're trying to catch up with a friend. There was a mix up with my food which was very upsetting and on top of that I found a hair in my food ! I was quite disgusted. Upon receiving the check and paying the waitress shooed us away with her hands which was very disrespectful. There are other ways to politely clear the table. They rush your experience.

Every time I go it's as good and consistent since the first time I went. Service is always good. Waiting on the waitlist usually isn't that long when I go usually. Since I usually come here to eat by myself or a couple of friends. I always get the same order every time I come here and I am never disappointed about any of the food I get from here. Sometimes if the seating is packed I just choose to do take out and I usually only wait around 30-40 mins for my food which isn't so bad at all. It's all worth the wait for me. There's always music playing from other places surrounding it and it feels really lively. This is my go to kbbq spot even though I don't get to see them cook the meat since I always dine outside.

When the kimchi came, my friend was trying to cut them with the scissor that was sitting on the table, then this young waiter walked over put the pork on the grill and start yelling at her ""kimchi is already cut. don't touch the scissor, put it down now. This is for us to use!"" We we're all shocked. Of course he didn't use the scissor at the time and just walk away. Totally unacceptable. Will never return again.

Regardless I can speak from my experience! They have indoor and outdoor seating it looks like. I put my name down on the waitlist for 4 on a Thursday night, and it was about a 30-45min wait so we grabbed a drink at Itaewon Pocha next door. They texted us when our table was ready, and in we went, up the elevators to their main floor. Wow, this was NOT like the KBBQ joints I'm used to in the Bay Area/Socal. Where I am used to Gen KBBQ-like places, where it resembles a posh nightclub.... clean and modern, flashy lights, def like a fancy hotel lobby or something.. this place had more of a traditional feel. No flashy lights in sight. Def change of pace for me but I loved it. Music, similar to Gen was still upbeat and pumping. We were seated and my friend got straight to ordering. I had some sort of soju cocktail (I think, I can't actually remember..), and my friends had some beers. In came the meat. We got 3 dishes. I think 2 beef and 1 pork, like I said this may not be helpful since I did not order lol, HOWEVER, what I loved, and I know this sounds dumb, was that the servers came over and cooked the meat for us. At Gen and the like, I'm usually the one slaving over the hot grill, cooking and cutting the meat for everyone. Can you tell I'm a mom? The meat was so tender and juicy..... Sides were delicious. The real showstopper though was the Kimchi Pancake... best I've ever had in my life. It was perfectly crispy and the flavor was just.. delicious......

Benjamin B.,/user_details?userid=kVFo_IdWbM-sriAHKc0fxA,"New York, NY",9/17/2021,3.0,"My review of Jongro will probably be quite divisive as I know this restaurant has many fans. I overall felt it was okay and I probably would like it more were it not for the fact that NYC is filled with kbbq restaurants. Meat quality and cooking service were both fine but there frankly wasn't anything that actually distinguished it from all of the other restaurants along the street. Yes, it tastes better than the average AYCE joint but it's also not a particularly inexpensive option for kbbq here. What really makes the restaurant for you is probably the vibe and atmosphere: if you want something a bit more loud and fun you will be pretty disappointed. If you find places like Baekjeong, Samwon Garden, or Cote to be way too noisy of a dinner experience then you will probably appreciate what Jongro has to offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/jongro-bbq-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friend said it came highly recommended, and she did not lie. We chose a rlly delicate window to eat because the wait quickly became over three hours vs our twenty mins. My highest recommendation. Order the rice cakes and the platter. Your bill is going to higher, but it's worth it.

The wait is not that bad even on a Saturday/Sunday when they are the busiest. It's best to go with a group of 5 or more. They only allow reservations for a group of 8.

I thoroughly enjoyed the bbq experience. They have delicious soju flavors as well. I took out one star cause i felt like it was too quick. I couldn't enjoy my food as much as I wanted since the servers we too quick to serve and ready with the bill. I understand the wait time hence I did not object.
