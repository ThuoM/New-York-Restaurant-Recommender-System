This was my first time coming to this spot and I'm so glad I finally stopped by. The waiter was very helpful in explaining the menu and making sure that my peanut allergy was known to the kitchen staff. We had the guac, charred octopus, Taco De tromps, and the Pork Tacos. Just know that everything comes pretty small so you've got to get a few different items to get full. The only reason why I can't give this place five stars is because I absolutely hated the dessert option. It was basically a fried churro type thing with cream but I felt the cream didn't have enough taste and that the fried crispy bits had no substance but that's just me! I'd love to see a few more dessert options for the dairy sensitive people.

My friend recommended Aldama when for lunch after we had spent the morning at Domino Park. I hadn't heard of the restaurant but my friend only had glowing things to say about it. We walked about 10 minutes from the park to the restaurant which is located in south Williamsburg. Aldama is a modern Mexican restaurant that's ideal for a special night out. The spot is on the smaller side with a large bar and table seating around that. When it came time to order we decided to get the guacamole as well as an assortment of canasta and trompo tacos which were amazing. We also had the house margarita which was equally exceptional.

Jerry L.,/user_details?userid=dXOV0wBcViWf7TYvy2ItbA,"New Rochelle, NY",8/22/2022,4.0,"This place is pretty unassuming when you first enter, you'd think this place was just a small bar with a few seats but when you get taken through to the seating area you'll see there is more indoor and outdoor seating. My friend made a reservation for Saturday at 5:30 and we were able to be seated right away. All the staff was very nice, we really liked the ambiance and the decor, one thing that was funny was the little water cup, now they did keep our cups filled but it was just enough to take a swallow of water before someone had to come back around and fill it up again. Now this menu is very unique and besides some things like guacamole this menu looked nothing like I'd ever seen in a Mexican restaurant, now that's not really a bad thing because the food was really good and of great quality, we got the guacamole which instead of being served with tortilla chips was served with 3 tortillas that were of the same consistency of a chip, no complaints it was great and had a little spice to it, you can tell they didn't over do it with salt and instead used herbs and spices, that's important to me. We got the duck appetizer which was unique and good, we also got the Taco De Trompo which also was good but really $9 for a taco? Now it was unique I have to give them that but really overpriced in my opinion, we shared the Asado which is a 26 oz steak, it's served with some cheese with fig we think and tortillas also with a green sauce, now the quality of this steak is great, well flavored but not overly seasoned and can easily be shared by 3-4 people, you definitely pay a lot for it but it's good, what I didn't like is when we finished the tortillas and were offered more we expected that it would be complimentary considering the amount we paid for it but I was disappointed later to see that we were charged for it, now in comparison to the price of the total bill it was small change but it's the principle in my mind, this is a unique place that is very pricey but it's also unlike any Mexican place I've been to before, the drinks are pricey as well, it's a good place to check out but for my budget I couldn't come here too often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aldama-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We started with the tacos de canasta, yellowfin ceviche, and taco de trompo. All were phenomenal in their own ways, but the taco de trompo was probably the best taco I have had -- and this is from someone who adores tacos de trompo and al pastor tacos like no one I've ever met. Completely worth the price, was an experience that left me only wanting more, which in this case is a good thing.

Many vegans and vegetarians will come here for the vegan mole - which is a dish one basically never comes across, it's practically an oxymoron. This restaurant makes a big deal about this dish. It's the most expensive on the menu. And it is awful. Besides being almost nothing other than mole - a few tiny  mushrooms, that's it - the mole tastes burnt with a charcoal aftertaste. No one at my table found anything positive to say about it. And two of us found it repugnant enough to stop eating entirely.

Tom T.,/user_details?userid=iFUYIIfEGMSt3F8JC-NUbw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/15/2021,3.0,"Underwhelming... Maybe since it was a soft opening ( I hope), I'll give them another shot in a couple of months.  I got duped by the nyeater article prior to visiting. ""Despite his history serving drinks at top-tier restaurants, Reyes wants Aldama to be an approachable, everyday hangout. ""I don't want to have a hundred different tequilas and mezcals on our wall,"" he says. Instead, the bar is focusing on 10 bottles of each, available for sipping from copitas with slices of oranges. A happy hour -- 5 to 7 p.m. daily -- advertises frozen margaritas and beer and mezcal shot combos for $10 or less."".....  There was no mezcal selection, only one cocktail list with 6 drinks ($14 each), one with mezcal....and it was frozen...I'd assume since the founder of the establishment is a bartender, the drinks would be more impressive...to each their own. Food menu was short as well and did not wow me either (and we ordered everything with the exception of the guacamole) There are only 2 meat options on the menu, both are small plates.  One is the cecina; thinly sliced, dried, crispy filet( think beef jerky meets chicharron) and the tacos- very good!  As explained by our server, the corn is imported de Mexico and milled in house! Growing pains... I'm sure they'll right the ship...

Brianna Y.,/user_details?userid=reLf-qZK35KQM3ygB1jhAQ,"Manhattan, NY",3/3/2023,4.0,"4 stars for the food but two and a half or three for the ambiance. It's a crowded little place, and we were seated in the far back - an area that was likely an outdoor space previously and felt like it (we kept our coats on as it was super cold). The food came super speedily; there was no space between the apps and the entrees. The fried tofu was very tasty, as was the celltuce salad. Less successful were the 886 noodles. The flavor resembled sesame noodles and had a strong peanuty flavor and viscous texture. They were also super oily. We preferred the beef noodle soup but, overall, felt that the apps were more successful flavor-wise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wenwen-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

From the outside, it's a bit easy to miss - not very well marked or bright colors and once you go inside it's on the smaller side; tiny but cozy. The kitchen seems to be downstairs and the seating is right next to the bar area. The bathrooms are fun though, it's like disco themed. I opted to skip the BDSM chicken (if you want to try it make sure to come at 5pm since they only make 5 for the day) and instead tried their braised fish stuffed with fish cake. That was the best thing in my opinion; I also tried the you fan with bacon, pea shoots with tofu skin, and 886 noodle. They were all good but pretty salty. The tables are also kind of tightly packed next to one another.

Definitely a fun and lively atmosphere inside, with everyone as much into the food as they were the conversations happening around it. Didn't have any drinks this time around but they had several tasty looking cocktails (and mocktails too!). The winner for me was the cold sesame noodles. I could've devoured them all, if only I had a fork. The pea shoots with tofu skin were a tasty veggie dish, and the shrimp floss was certainly an interesting try. I thought the lettuce served with the shrimp floss should have been something more cup-like to better hold the dishes' contents, but we made do. There was much more to try on the menu than we had room for, so I wouldn't hesitate to come back and try the BDSM chicken or the soup-less Taiwanese beef noodles if I were in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wenwen-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We didn't get to order the BDSM chicken, which is supposed to be the most popular and limited item on the menu. The shrimp floss lettuce cup might be the only thing we ordered that I would want to eat again. I loved the crunch of the youtiao and it was a unique spin on the lettuce wraps I've had in the past. Listed in order of what I liked most to least, we also got the pork belly and cuttlefish, 886 noodles, and crispy fried tofu.

It was pretty good! My fave dishes were the fried tangyuan, it was a super unique take on a classic Chinese dish that I grew up eating, and the fried popcorn chicken. I give it 4 stars because while Wenwen puts a fun spin on classic Taiwanese dishes, I almost prefer the classic dishes without all the pizzazz! Some of the flavors were too overpowering like the pork belly with rice. Regardless, the service was fantastic & a great spot to catch up with friends over dinner at a trendy casual spot with drinks.

I was lucky enough to snag a reservation about a month ago and wow, I see why it's so popular. We started with the celtuce salad, which was lip-tingly, garlicky, and unassumingly incredible. Next came the hot honey popcorn chicken, which might just have been my favorite dish with the right amount of sweet and spicy. We shared two entrees, the three-cup chicken, which was... perfect, and the cold sesame noodles (skip these, they're fine but lack any standout flavor). The black sesame mochi dessert was mindblowing, with a completely unique combination of flavors. I'm also super appreciative to our lovely server, who gave us shots and guava juice for the road.

I particularly liked their popcorn chicken (I'm a big fan of Taiwanese fried chicken) and their nori fries SO GOOD!! Their fried rice hits home for me but the pork on top wasn't my favorite so I think I'll forgo it next time.

Jennifer H.,/user_details?userid=wMesVy-YeK571bFeTFcoYA,"New York, NY",11/16/2022,4.0,"I was skeptical going in because I grew to not enjoy 886 that much and knew the same owner opened Wenwen. However, I was really happy with the food both times I dined. The second time we were lucky enough to get one of the orders of the bdsm fried chicken (they only sell a few per day so I'd say it's worth trying if the opportunity presents itself) and it was delightful. I am not a huge fan of beef noodle soup and am very particular about the taste (the best ones I've had are still from hole in the wall places in Taiwan), but really like the one here! Pass on the you-fan - I prefer mine authentic and the spices they use do not do this dish any favors. The fish is a no brainer - the flavor is phenomenal and my favorite part is they debone it for you! If you want to order a vegetable to balance our the meal I suggest getting the water spinach. I also enjoyed the crispy tofu - the garlic sauce they give is tasty. I don't remember the cocktails I ordered but they were also good and it's exciting that this place serves alcohol because that was a missing element to 886. The downstairs seating area is definitely not as nice, but it didn't impact the service.

The curry in its own right was good and I like the new packaging for the to-go order.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/go-go-curry-new-york-33?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Honghui Y.,/user_details?userid=KxRU2t_MJQmYu0KyiE1nZQ,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",7/2/2021,4.0,"Great place to grab lunch. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu at this point and everything is good. If you're hungry or indecisive, I'd go with the homerun curry, which gives you a little bit of everything. Vegetarians also need not fear - there's a tofu katsu and veggie tempura option, but just remember to ask for the vegetarian curry sauce as well (I think their default curry has pork in it). The only issue I run into sometimes is that service can be a bit slow. They seem to be short staffed frequently, often with one guy acting as both cook and cashier, so I've had to wait as long as 20 minutes for take out. Not the end of the world, and the food is ultimately worth it when you get it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/go-go-curry-new-york-33?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I preferred the pork and chicken over the fish, which really isn't worth it. The shrimp was also pretty small but covered in plenty of breading. Everything was nice and crispy and the curry was really good too. It wasn't spicy at all. I wish there was just a bit more curry sauce though.
