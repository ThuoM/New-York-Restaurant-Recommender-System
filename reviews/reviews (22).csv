It was a flavor and texture explosion from the first bite- tangy and sweet, soft and crunchy. My husband ordered the pork chop and was not disappointed, as he is usually upset with portion sizes, this did not disappoint.

We watched as it was taken back, tasted by the chef, who was repulsed by it too. our drinks were good and the steak was okay, but after recommending what i thought was one the best restaurants in brooklyn to several friends, it really did feel like a let down. no fault to the staff or the chefs but i don't know. im just... saddened by the whole experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/arden-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Granted it was 6:15 but the place fills up early as the outdoor seating is wonderful for people watching during after work / early dinner hours. The service was excellent from the waitress to the busboys. Food was milanese italian style. A bit pricey but great for a neighborhood joint. Nice cocktail list. Pace of food was properly spaced. After being in the hamptons in the summer where the service is terrible and full of pretentious assholes it was nice to be back in brooklyn with some more diversity and nice people.

Jenn C.,/user_details?userid=h2cDvbkq0HppS0ULB6eZ4w,"Brooklyn, NY",8/24/2022,2.0,"The food was ok, but the service is completely disorganized. We ordered drinks that took a very long time to come, and then all of our dishes came out at once, which left us with lukewarm entrees by the time we finished what was supposed to be our first course. They also forgot to bring out the crudo we ordered and brought it at the very end of the meal. Also don't let them seat you at the raw bar, it's way too close to the kitchen and people are whizzing by with plates constantly, making it way too tight and uncomfortable to enjoy your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/saraghina-caff%C3%A8-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Melisa B.,/user_details?userid=FAJehK_wSEOouOmjGFxMqA,"Brooklyn, NY",4/25/2022,5.0,"Was totally blown away by Saraghina's new place! Not only is the food spectacular (truffle arancini is highly recommended, crab ravioli is out of this world and all three desserts where outrageous but I particularly loved the tiramisu) plus the cocktails are superb as well (heavenly Negroni). The wine list is well curated by their excellent sommelier and all of the staff were very knowledgable as well as warm and friendly, shout out to Jazzy and Rhonda! A true gift to the Ft Greene neighborhood. All of that goodness in a stunning room. Was well worth the wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/saraghina-caff%C3%A8-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We had such a great experience from atmosphere to the food, but especially the service from our waiter Sebastian. He recommended the papardelle which was delicious. Will definitely return making sure to find our favorite server again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/saraghina-caff%C3%A8-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Laila P.,/user_details?userid=X81HHthtJLBJA3viHK5gWg,"New York, NY",4/22/2022,1.0,"I'm going to be honest here and tell you that I'm not really going to talk about the food. It was alright. I'm not a food critic and I'm not going to pretend to be. Was it worth the over $300 it cost? Not really, in my opinion. The steak was overwhelmingly salty, the portions were small and highly priced, the meringue was mostly whipped cream and I actually have no idea what part of it was meringue but I digress. I've had meals I enjoyed more for considerably less, but then again, my taste is not yours, and I am not going to impress it upon you. What I am going to talk about is the fact that Saraghina is one of the most egregious examples of  gentrification I have seen yet. The air is infected with a sort of wealthy self importance that I have never found even in small amounts to be pleasant, and especially not in this case, where it permeates the very tile. I was even rushed out after my exceptionally overpriced meal and told to leave because ""there are people waiting for your spot."" I am every bit sympathetic to accommodating other people, but the complete lack of tact with which it was brought up was palpable, like a cloying, sickly sweet perfume worn by someone with a demeanor that expresses cleanly and plainly that they think you are not worth their time. There are many beautiful and unique restaurants across New York City that display the vast array of cultures and people that live here. This embarrassingly over-gilded ""upper crust"" establishment is as far as anything can be from what makes NYC special, and I urge you to support smaller local businesses across the city that both need and actually deserve your patronage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/saraghina-caff%C3%A8-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
