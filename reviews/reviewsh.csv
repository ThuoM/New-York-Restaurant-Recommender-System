No veggies (unless you count a few raw peas). No bread to sop up the endless parade of gravies and curries. No crispy textures or contrasting flavor elements. And a thimbleful of rice with our mouthful of tuna. The meal was fine. It was just outrageously overpriced for what it was.

I have had a few similar new one star restaurants in New York...especially Brooklyn that just seemed hype over execution. Enter clover hill. A (literally) hidden gem in an obscure corner of Brooklyn heights. Actually this block in Brooklyn is worth a visit alone. Chef charlie Mitchell is on his way to his second Michelin star very soon. He has taken fine dining and infused it with American spice and excitement. His delightfully filling menu is hit after hit. Once you enter the dark, moody, small interior you are greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff. The pace of the meal is just fine. The drink menu is streamlined but solid. If I have one note it is I would love some sort of menu to accompany meal service. Call me old fashioned but I like to read what I'm eating not just heat it. This is a seafood focused menu and I am fine with that. I'd even say no need to upgrade to the meat dish. Fish is what they do so go for the ride. The crab tart was a fun take on the dish and took me to summers on the boardwalk! I could eat that farro porridge every day! So delicious.

The bronzino was better but again nothing special. My girlfriends ordered a passion fruit crème brûlée for dessert and the presentation was nice but the texture was a little odd. The service over all was excellent. The bill came out to $150 each with tax and tip for the three of us $450. For $150 per person for a meh experience I would not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-francis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This time I was greeted by a man, who promptly informed me that I did not have a reservation. I was about to take out my phone to show him my confirmation when the lovely hostess advised him(I later learned his name is Bashir) that I did in fact have a reservation. She proceeded to give me my choice of table, I sat down and was joined by my party. We were so happy to have Nikolina taking care of us again. Our appetizers arrived and were delicious. The entrees arrived, and I ordered the Steak Frites medium rare. It arrived black and blue.  I just can't eat steak at that temperature, so I asked that it be cooked to temperature. Bashir brought it out after about 2 minutes. The end pieces were rare, and the middles were still cold in the middle. I moved them to the side and decided to eat just the ends. I wasn't going to enjoy it, but I'd a kitchen can't cook your steak to the right temperature on the 2nd try, you just live with it. Nikolina noticed and asked what was wrong and I explained and she took the plate and said that the kitchen would make it right. Much later, after my dining companions already finished their entrees, Bashir brought out a new steak that was cooked to medium rare. He asked me if I ordered medium well or medium rare, because this steak was medium well, and what I received before was medium rare. And he said this rudely and abruptly. Now I don't know about you, but I've ordered plenty of streams and I know the difference between black and blue and medium rare, and when I order a medium rare steak at The Grill, I get steak #2, perfect pink ring around a red center that is warm.  He said enjoy, in an offhand way and my husband, who was infuriated by how he spoke to me in such a condescending manner, replied not so much. The supercilious Bashir proceeded to offer a mocking bow, with the swirling hand gesture.  This led to a bit of a scene, I'm not gonna lie. Nikolina came over, she was very upset. She sent over the other manager, a tall gentleman with a beard, who really didn't know how to handle the situation at all. Besides saying I'm sorry, he didn't say much or do much to diffuse the situation. I just asked for the check, from which he didn't even have the wherewithal to remove the steak, which I left uneaten. I don't need any favors, but when your employee has antagonized your guests to the point where they have to leave food uneaten, you should do something that acts like mouthwash on the bad taste in their mouth. As for Bashir, who I think is a misogynist, he shouldn't be anywhere in front of clients. As for me, I will never go back to this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-francis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were very excited and ordered off the prix fixed menu and added some appetizers as well. The food was good and well presented (I think the Panko crusted escargot was fine but had too much parsley to the point where that's all you tasted). For drinks we wanted to share a bottle of wine and our waiter recommended the Sancerre. Without a drink menu in front of us we simply asked if we could please have the cheapest bottle as we were four young women all meeting after work from our new jobs. The wine came out and was so delicious we ordered two bottles throughout the meal - little did we know that the cheapest bottle was $110! La Brasserie is a beautiful restaurant and is a place for fine dining so this might be fine for other patrons but we felt it was inappropriate of our waiter to not at least warn us that the bottle we were ordering was very expensive since we were obviously a young group and had explicitly asked for the cheapest bottle!

Came here before a concert and I waited over an hour for food that never came. (Bulgogi stew). Told a waiter I no longer wanted the food and in the end there was no communication and guessing they came out with it anyway since there was a stew in their hand but they didn't even know where to put it and took it back to the kitchen. After asking for the check they still put the stew on my bill and came out to check that there was no stew bowl on my table before taking it off the check. No apologies were given to me and meanwhile tables that were seated well after us were served all their food pretty fast. Was recommended this place by a friend as I was told their food is good.

Jezz S.,/user_details?userid=yml0Zh4A0y3hrkgu_sEr2g,"Brooklyn, NY",6/8/2022,4.0,Get the plum berry mojito!!!!!!!!!! It was so delicious. Best cocktail I've had in awhile. I also enjoyed the Beef Mandu which was also yummy! Only reason this is not a 5 star review is because of service. My friend is allergic to egg. She ordered the Bibimbap which egg is no where listed on the menu. When we received the order we had to send it back because it egg was front in center and broke when we tried to scoop it out. Ever since that moment the waitress seemed not very happy with us even though we had no control over an allergy and the egg wasn't on the menu. It was hard to get a hold of the waitress for the check. I guess she was pretty much done with us since we sent a whole bowl of food back. So overall only downfall of the experience is the menu not listing all the items in the dish that's a common allergy. I still think it's worth visiting this spot and enjoying the food and drinks they have. I ordered a small this time because I had things to do after lunch. Oh! Go here for lunch. It's not busy. It's very chill lunch spot if you're eating with a friend or dining alone. 10/10 would visit again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kuun-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Melissa G.,/user_details?userid=OipEBURRJe4_ktREfWclkw,"New York, NY",8/1/2020,5.0,"Kuun is a Korean restaurant on Livingston Street, Downtown Brooklyn.  The outdoor seating is super cute and with tables spaced more than 6 feet away. This made me feel more comfortable dining outdoors during this crazy pandemic period. You will be served water and complimentary pickled vegetables shortly after getting seated. Our server was always appropriately masked, very polite, helpful and even gave my pup a refreshing bowl of water .  I had the pork Jjajangmyun (noodles with perfect texture and firmness!) and excellent savory soybean sauce - not spicy at all and generously portioned too (I had more than my fill and then some to bring home). My husband loved the (very) spicy seafood Jjambbong (ramen).

Overall the food was excellent and definitely some of the best Korean delivery I have had during the pandemic. The sweet and spicy chicken wings are the bomb. Order a side of green cabbage kimchi, pull of some chicken from the wings and wrap it in the kimchi(you can thank me later). They were almost as good the second day reheated in the oven. The jabchae was also pretty stellar, not too sweet and held up very well as leftovers the next day. Vegtable Mandu also very good, these did not travel as well as other things. The seafood PaJeon is just one of my favorite things to eat and they did an excellent job. These are tricky dishes to get as delivery but they pulled it off. Now the BiBimbap was executed perfectly considering there is no stone pot. They managed to get the rice crispy for delivery and I am still trying to figure out how they did that. The one thing they did forget was the Gochujang sauce which would have been very disappointing if I did not have a tub in my refrigerator so that is one reason for not giving them five stars. The other reason was the sauteed black beens were under cooked and way too sweet and no sesame seeds. With the exception of these small mishaps the food was excellent.

Jane L.,/user_details?userid=_W1HZ_lW34YUjCIFIVrHFQ,"Queens, NY",10/24/2022,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this new iteration of Momofuku Ssam Bar. I was a big fan of the old location and appreciated how intimate it was and how it reflected the David Chang swagger of the other earlier Momofuku restaurants. That vibe is nowhere to be found in the new location. It feels like an overpriced tourist trap geared toward people who have a lot of money to spend, want to dabble in some gateway Korean food (and/or perhaps are not comfortable with venturing to K-town), and want to see and be seen. It looks like it was designed for social media posts. That being said, the food was decent. Our group participated in the full Ssam tasting menu and liked all of the dishes. Nothing was exceptionally memorable for me other than the salad (randomly). All of the dishes were very ""safe"" and not terribly exciting, but they were well executed. The service was good until the end, when we were asked to leave because they had to ""free up the table,"" even though all of the large tables around us were unoccupied. One other observation that I found to be somewhat interesting (as an Asian) was that I didn't see any Asians among the many staff members who were working there the night we went. I find that unusual for  an Asian restaurant, but perhaps this just happened to be case the night we went. Ultimately, I doubt I will return to Ssam because it just feels like a ""new Coke"" version of the old location, but I do think the overall experience would be enjoyable for most people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Benjamin S.,/user_details?userid=zqnazpcNLo1VQiK_jTyyEw,"Brooklyn, NY",2/2/2022,1.0,"Long time fan and patron of Momofuku restaurants including Noodle Bar, Ssam Bar, Booker and Dax, Nishi and Ko (my 40th birthday, a breathtakingly beautiful and moving experience). Painful and bizarre experience this evening in the Seaport. Arrived early to our dinner reservation at the bar. Waited a while for someone to offer us a drink but eventually bartender did so, and we ordered, happy and excited to eat at a restaurant we've missed in the pandemic, and had never eaten at since its move from the EV. Had the wine list and menus in front of us as we began to cheers our first cocktail and look at the menus. A person--server, manager?--came around to our bar seats in a nearly empty restaurant (there was only one other person there), reached over me and plucked away the wine list. I said in a friendly way: ""I was planning on looking at the wine list for dinner."" The person looked at me with deadlights, coldly saying: ""Should I bring it back or were you planning on holding it for the duration?"" with an edge. I looked around in confusion. ""Do you need it right now?"" Again, deadlights. As if I were holding open the train doors during rush hour preventing the world from moving. She said fine, keep it and brusquely left. Her attitude was the opposite of hospitable. It was provocative, and scornful and ad hominem. It's hard to convey the strangeness and the low grade contempt/rage of the person talking to us in this review. Who cares about the wine list? Not me! Certainly was happy to relinquish it if someone else needed it! But there was no one there in the restaurant besides us and this person's attitude was nothing but disagreeable bordering on hateful. My partner and I looked at each other in bewilderment. We debated what to do and agreed we had no desire to stay for a meal after such a strange and odious interaction. I paid the check for two cocktails and we left, abandoning a dinner we had been looking forward to for a week. I explained to the hostess the reason we were leaving on the way out. She seemed to intuit why we were leaving but didn't apologize, only said she hoped we found a place to eat that we liked, as if we were hard to please, entitled guests. Hard to imagine ever wanting to go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It has none of the energy or ambiance of the original. It's severely corporate (although the views from the outdoor seating are indeed fabulous), large screen TV's on the walls, & wildly overpriced; the small portions are barely share-able, and the service was lousy (we ordered one cocktail which was served after most of the appetizers had arrived and the waitperson had to be reminded, & one appetizer arrived after the main courses were served, again, after a reminder). The food itself was very good, but the menu is smaller and the variety was limited. Many of the menu items that brought us to the old location were gone and they refused to make anything that was not on the menu (which they would cheerfully do at the old spot).  Did I mention it was overpriced?  I would not go back.  David Chang lost a loyal Saam Bar customer with his move out of the East Village.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The space is so well planned with the pasta bar in the middle and the seats around over looking all the chefs. Make sure to get a seat at the bar for a real show! We ordered the egg yolk ravioli, the vegan mafalda, and the fig salad and a glass of Gavi. They gave us some bread and olive oil and the oil was sooo delicious you can tell they care about quality. The raviolo was the star of the show I will come back strictly for this!! So so so delicious. The egg yolk was perfectly runny and the truffle was a perfect addition. Perfectly balanced, not heavy as you'd expect and it seems like a small portion but it's perfectly satisfying. The fig salad was delicious but I'd next time request without the dressing and add something a little acidic like a vinegar instead I think that was missing. The Mafalda felt like a minestrone soup sauce it was good but not my favorite. Still, I'd come back and try other dishes and or course get the raviolo again.

Sarah M.,/user_details?userid=meLbQpNwuZA5vzZiLrkfSg,"Vienna, VA",4/8/2023,1.0,"Would give this joke of an establishment 0 stars if I could. Management and upper management are absolutely horrible. I had a reservation which had to be cancelled due to an emergency and I contacted the restaurant. The employee on the phone let us know everything would be totally fine, there would be no charge since we called long before the reservation. Come a few days later we were charged $60 for the cancelled reservation. We contacted management and we were told we could only talk to the office management through email. The office management was rude, not accommodating, and even though they accepted the fact that we were told we wouldn't be charged, they still didn't accept a refund. We don't live in New York and they tried to push us into coming back to the restaurant. Why would I ever come back to this grimey stingy location?? They lied to us over the phone, took our money, and asked us to come back? This place is a joke. Go to vapianos for the same mediocre experience and you'll probably get a billion times the service.

Joyce K.,/user_details?userid=XHET80aOWBvNXlMhSCM7bg,"New Brunswick, NJ",6/12/2022,5.0,"For my friend's birthday, we made a reservation for two at A Pasta Bar in their covered outdoor seating at 6:30 pm on a Saturday evening. The QR code menu was extremely helpful as each menu item was accompanied by a photo. For drinks, I ordered the Casual Affair and my friend got the Aperitif. I admit that the photos are slightly misleading as the drinks did not come with a straw, the watermelon slice in the Casual Affair was within the drink instead of on the rim, and the glass that the Aperitif came in was interestingly tall and skinny. I could definitely taste the vodka in my drink, but I felt that there was a nice balance of fruitiness with the alcohol. We were provided with three slices of free bread with olive oil, but the bread was a bit difficult to eat and was not warm. For entrees, my friend got the Chiocciole Al Ragu and I chose the Caramelle based on the interesting picture on the menu. I was extremely satisfied with the Caramelle. I was previously unfamiliar with Caramelle pasta, but it's essentially pasta in the shape of a piece of candy enclosing a filling inside. In this case, the filling was a mixture of zucchini, mint, and ricotta. I particularly enjoyed how the mint cut through the taste of the pasta, as it provided a refreshing different level to the taste. The mint pesto and burrata mousse not only made the dish look more creative, but were also delicious to dip the pasta in. The crushed pistachio served as a nice variety in texture and I liked the crunch that it had when eaten with the pasta. Overall, I genuinely enjoyed my experience at A Pasta Bar ⁠-- the service was great, the outdoor seating was pleasant, and the meal was superb. The meal was on the pricier end with most of the entrees costing ~$30, which is a bit much for the portions, but at least for my dish, I would say that it was worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-pasta-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However, we weee seated an hour late because the lovely hostess accidentally cancelled our reservation. To make up for this they told us they would cover our first round of drinks. We confirmed this with them THREE TIMES. After being seated one hour later and eating our meal (which also was not served on time) we received the bill and we're charged for that first round of drinks. We were told by DOMINIC that the round would not be covered, even though we had confirmed three times with him personally before we ordered.

Atmosphere of Sola is very chic and trendy. Definitely prime date spot (where the guy pays) if you want the vibes - both inside and outside. Pasta is just meh. It's fine, but nothing out of the ordinary, and for the price, I consider it to be subpar. We did the pasta tasting and so tried their most popular dishes. My favorites are the truffle one (tagliatella al tartufo Nero) and the pepper one (tonnarelli cacio e pepe). Both of these had lots of sauces and were flavorful / rich. The pasta itself was on the chewier side but also quite mediocre if compared to other hand pulled pastas. The rigatoni was quite hard. Cooked but barely there. Maybe one of the worse dishes I've had in NYC lol. Gnocchi was good - cheese in the middle. We liked it. Uni pasta was meh. Nothing special, would not get again. Much better uni pastas at domo domo or Sakamai.

When we walked in, we were seated immediately next to the sign on the wall and were impressed by the ambiance of the restaurant. Having the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant was a nice twist. Our waiter was extremely attentive and always made sure our glass of water was full. We jumped right into ordering our pasta and were surprised with how quickly they served us (brought out our dishes within 5 minutes of ordering!). The pasta itself was absolutely delicious. The Rigatoni Arrabiata had an excellent balance of tomato and spice. I tried my girlfriends caccio y pepe and it was very well made! The sauce had the perfect amount of creaminess with a hint of pepper to balance it out. Additionally, I was very impressed by the plating of the pasta. We topped off our dinner with an order of Tiramisu which was pretty standard. Overall, A Pasta Bar was a great experience and I would highly recommend as a date night location.

Because of Covid, all the tables were separated by  plastic barriers and staff were all wearing masks. We started off with the pasta chips which came with burrata. I've never had or even heard of pasta chips before! There was an Italian seasoning on top of the pasta chips and dipping it in the burrata added the perfect balance of savoriness from the chips and creaminess of the burrata. The portion of the chips were small, but they also give complimentary bread and olive oil too in the beginning. If you have burrata leftover, they will also give you bread to eat with it. Be careful not to fill yourself up though because the pasta portions are a good size! I got the cacio e pepe for my entree. I loved it! The pasta was al dente and the sauce with the black pepper was delicious! They have plenty of vegetarian options to choose from. We ended it with chocolate and hazelnut gelato.

Nick R.,/user_details?userid=bMMHSUVTSqY5N9o3b_VYVQ,"Chicago, IL",11/1/2020,4.0,"I came here with some friends to celebrate a birthday back in September. We ordered their pasta tasting to share, which included 5 pre selected pasta dishes, Carciofi as an appetizer, and Tiramisu for dessert. The pasta dishes were good. There were interesting flavors and a nice variety of pasta types, sauces, and combinations. That being said, it wasn't the best pasta I've ever had and some of the dishes were definitely better than others. My least favorite but most aesthetically pleasing was the 24k gold spaghetti Ricci. It tasted really boring and bland despite its unique appearance. The gnoccho ripieno was a better dish, the gnoccho was incredibly soft and melted in your mouth. The sauce was also well made and went well with the pasta. The malfalda al ragu was one of the more traditional pasta dishes with bolognese sauce and Parmesan cheese but was actually one of my favorite because the spices in the sauce were so tasty and the home made spaghetti was equally great. The Tagliatella Al Tartufo Bianco D'Alba was another good dish with unique flavors. The truffle on top and the creamy sauce went perfectly together and created a blast of flavors in your mouth. The Tonarelli Cacio E Pepe was a little too heavy on the pepper and it drowned out any other flavors. As for the carciofi and tiramisu, these were both very average. The carciofi was quite bland and the artichoke has a strange texture that wasn't very pleasing. The tiramisu was more of a pudding than a cake but had the classic tiramisu taste. Surprisingly, their coffee was exceptionally good, might have been the highlight of the night. Their service was great and they put a candle on the dessert for my friend, a welcoming touch. Although it isn't the best Italian food I've ever had, I found it interesting and worth a try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-pasta-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Brianne F.,/user_details?userid=q09Rkh_H6Wlkc9FrMkwo6g,"New York, NY",3/10/2021,2.0,"The only reason I'm leaving the 2 stars that I did was because the food was delicious! Other than that, the experience for my friends and I was horrendous when it comes to hospitality. The birthday girl and I arrived for our 6pm reservation at 6:08. We reserved the cabin, (which we had to pay upfront prior to making the reservation.) the host let us know that our cabin wasn't ready but we could wait inside and have a drink while we wait. We sat inside the restaurant and we saw through the glass all of the cabins had guests. So we didn't feel bad about being 8 min late. We ordered cocktails and the other girls arrived and ordered as well. Around 6:45 we were escorted into our cabin. Before even sitting in our chair they were trying to get all of our orders in. We let them know we need some time to look over the menu. Minutes later another person came into our cabin to let us know since our reservation was at 6pm that's when the time starts on our 90 minutes. 45 min?! We have 45 minutes to enjoy a birthday dinner for our friend? We thought they were kidding, but then realized they were dead serious when they brought all of our 5 pasta tasting menus out ontop of eachother. My friend and I were actually holding our first tasting bowl in our hand trying to finish it as fast as We could because they were placing the next pastas on the table. I had to ask them to give us new plates and silverware, (as our previous pastas were red sauce and the new ones were cream) we ordered a bottle of wine during the pasta tasting. Our server proceeded to pour the entire bottle out in one round. I was in utter shock. I've never seen such disrespectful hospitality. Blatantly telling us to hurry the hell up and get out. There were at least 2-3 servers constantly in or around our cabin which made me feel very uncomfortable due to the fact we're in An enclosed CABIN with 4 people and now we have 7 people at all times in our cabin due to staff lingering, waiting to grab anything empty that they can clear and get us out quicker. (But with all of the people around my water was always empty) It was OBVIOUS, very noticeable they were kicking us out. When it came to ordering a dessert for our friend. We ordered and let them know it was her birthday. 1 minute after ordering  she got up to go to the bathroom and saw them coming out of the restaurant heading toward us with her birthday dessert and candle. How they got it that quick and raced out i have no clue, She had to walk back into the cabin and not use the bathroom because they put it down on the table without waiting, she had to blow out her candles and then leave her dessert sitting there to use the bathroom. When our bill came, they let us know they already took out 20 percent gratuity on the deposit we paid to reserve the cabin. Insane. Not only was the cabin a $99 min per person, but we spent way more than that and could have had a little bit more respect for our time, especially since we're supporting their business during these hard times. Seemed like they don't care about the quality of the experience only the money they are getting in their pockets. I will not be returning. And I will tell this story every time I hear about this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-pasta-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Gabriella T.,/user_details?userid=kKyIn46wvD_NkGaRqQAxcQ,"Jamaica, NY",1/15/2020,4.0,"This was a very trendy place (not surprising given the area in which it is located). That being said, I found it fairly authentic and interesting. Prices were not necessarily high considering the location, but the menu of course is fairly limited to just pasta, antipasto, and dessert. My boyfriend ordered the ragu (which I regret not getting because it looked delicious), and I ordered the gnocchi Ripieno. The gnocchi was not exactly my cup of tea or necessarily what I was expecting. I got 7 or 8 individual pieces of gnocchi stuffed with cheese and sauce. On top of the gnocchi was like a light oniony oil/gravy (almost clear in color).. it was unique and not bad, just not what I was expecting. I wouldn't have ordered it knowing that was what I was getting. The wine was good and fairly generously poured, and the bread was nice to munch on before receiving our meals. The ambiance was very nice and perfect for a nice lunch date. If in the area again, I'd consider returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-pasta-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Came here on a Saturday night and had to wait a bit for 3 seats at the bar but won't fault them because the place is worth the wait! It's got a fun, trendy ambience with loud music--sitting at the bar watching the chefs make the pasta is part of the experience. The cocktails were amazing, I got the cucumber margarita which was refreshing. My friend got the golden trick goal, their take on the Moscow mule. They bring out unlimited bread and their speciality olive oil while you're waiting and although it would be nice if the bread were hot, the combo is still delicious. Speaking of waiting, you do have to wait a bit for your pasta but I can't fault them because it's clear everything is made SO fresh. For mains, we got the tagliatelle al tartufo, the cacio e pepe, and the pacheri al pomodoro.

The host sat us down and the restaurant had a really nice heated outdoor seating with plastic barriers for social distancing. I will start with the only positive - we ordered the Burata to start and then had the rigatoni and the calcio e Pepe for main course. The food was 5/5 no complaints whatsoever. However our waiter was absolutely terrible. We waited 20 minutes to get asked what we wanted from when we sat down and he had served the table next to us even though they came after us. When I asked him if I could order he rudely replied ""wait"". And then I had a separate waiter come to take our order. I had ordered a drink as soon as we sat down and the drink came after I was done with my meal. I asked if I could get another drink and the waiter instead came out saying ""so sorry your drink never made it"". He then came with the check without even asking if we were done and basically got kicked out before we even had a second to answer if we were finished. By far the WORST customer service I have ever experienced in New York. I do not recommend this place. If you're in the area I suggest you visit a much better restaurant for both food and customer service such as Osteria Morini.

Mariya B.,/user_details?userid=58U4_8DnMxmjXQhLXSYtHQ,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",4/4/2021,1.0,I'm not that kind of person to write a review but this is just unacceptable in my eyes . So my cousin and I went to get brunch and this is the only place that didn't have a line for the table which was great. Hostess was nice and place is cute. BUT! We got lobster pasta and when we started eating it we saw black short HAIR inside of it! And right away we knew it's now our hair bc we have long hair and it was inside the pasta. We called our waiter and told him about it. So what he does? He just takes away dirty plate and brings clean plate. We had to tell him to take away pasta bc of the hair that was inside it. So he did that and brought new pasta for us. We never heard  apologies or anything. It felt like that was a norm for that place and  it's okay to find someone's HAIR inside your food during COVID. They should really check if their stuff is wearing hair nets while preparing food. I'm scared to think and see what's going on in their kitchen. For $40 pasta I would expect better customer service. If you guys like pasta with hair inside then I guess you found your place. Enjoy! I'm Never going there again and will never recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-pasta-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Khiladi H.,/user_details?userid=BMzZ5_eL3fmMYa6IiSdCPw,"Sunnyvale, CA",10/16/2018,1.0,Really wanted to like this place due to the ambience of open kitchen - but for the price of the food the quality was not good. Pasta was not cooked right - plus if you have an open kitchen you can do better than just assemble food from various boxes - I would have expected some more fresh ingredients. Salad was just so so. This place has the modern look and good presentation of food but taste and quality is sub-par. There are plenty of options in the vicinity and I would not go back here again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-pasta-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Food - it's ok, nothing special, although really really really small portion (check others pics)  for the price. BUT what a AWFUL experience me and my wife had with service, waiter if I recall name correctly from the receipt ""Mauro"". So we coming in the early evening and we were advised all the seats by left wall are free and we can grab any available. There was free table for four by the window. So we are sitting down, then suddenly waiter said ""oh this table is reserved"" - oh I thought maybe he forgot about that reservation, hence we took small table for two next to the ""reserved"" table. While we are reading menu, older couple has been given the table that we wanted AND table for four has been split so they can have ""own"" table. They definitely did NOT have reservation, but ok let's not ruin our nice evening. Finally waiter coming with complimentary bread and oil olive, he puts bread and small plate for oil on the table BUT NOT pouring oil. Instead we went to that older couple and gave them bread and olive oil. He is chatting with them (probably because he could speak Italian with them). And THEN after 2-3 mins he comes to our table to pour the olive oil. What the hell was that?????? If I was the owner of this business I would have closer look on this employee because I would NEVER go back there, purely based on this experience. I even tipped 20% with thought it goes to the others and cooks who deserve it NOT this ""Mauro"" - I hope one day someone give him a lesson, maybe owner of the place or other angry customer :) (I did not want to ruin the dinner for my wife)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/a-pasta-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

In terms of pasta the noodle was appropriately cooked aldente however the noodle itself was not tasty at all. It almost tasted off egg and it was not a home made noodle. The sauce was bland with very little flavor and was too salty. It basically tasted like an egg noodle with salt and spice. I think siracha may  actually have added flavor, sadly. I tasted my friends dish and her plate was similarly bland and unpleasant. We did not stay for dessert because the entree was so bad. I would have preferred to stay home and reheat pasta with sauce from a jar. The ambiance of the place was the only pro. It was pretty. I knew we had made a mistake though when they placed dry pasta into the pan. The prices are absolutely outrageous.

We waited for over an hour for our pasta to be ready. The restaurant wasn't super busy so I still don't understand why our food took so long. Literally, an hour later, our server came and said that they were having issues preparing our food. He said it would take 10 more minutes.. 20 minutes later our food finally arrived. At this point I'm so so hungry and now also super irritated because the service took forever. I was thinking they would try and make it up to us somehow but they didn't. They asked for full price for the food we didn't even get to eat. I asked for the food to go because my friend had evening plans, and after 1.5 hours there was no way we would have time to eat it there. They gave us our food in paper bags but they didn't have plastic utensils to eat it on the go.

Waiter even asked me if I enjoyed my food but I couldn't be transparent then and there so I'm here now with this review . Less would've been more in regards to this entree . They tried too hard with incorporating too much extras and the spinach ended up not even being detectable . I requested the food be mild and it had some spiciness to it as well which I hated .

Jake X.,/user_details?userid=agTdg4eqjeMOh5bF8dMJCw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",10/22/2022,3.0,"Pretty nice Indian restaurant in Williamsburg with a nice ambiance. Came around 5ish and was seated right away, as well as given a complimentary appetizer, with two really tasty sauces that were unfortunately snatched away. We ordered garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and aloo chana paneer. Everything came shortly after we ordered. You can choose the spiciness level of the entrees, and we chose regular, but it was already quite spicy. The garlic naan was great, crispy, soft, and flavorful. I enjoyed the chicken tikka masala. It was pretty saucy and creamy, yet I do think the chicken may have been a bit overcooked. I liked the aloo chana paneer too, but I do wish there were more paneer cubes and potatoes than chickpeas, which I felt like I was eating mostly, Also, both were a tad bit spicy to my liking, but I also do not have good spice tolerance. Luckily, the waitstaff was constantly refilling my water, and the water was ice cold and refreshing. After we finished our food, they seemed to be setting up candles for dinner time. All in all, I did enjoy my experience at Atithi, but I would not recommend it to those who have a horrible spice tolerance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/atithi-indian-cuisine-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Not only was it flavorful but it paired well with the bread. Chef's Kiss for sure. The chicken in the Goi Ga was so flavorful and juicy that I'm still thinking about it one week later. As for entrees, we got the BBH Beef Shank and it was a flavor explosion in my mouth. It was so much food that we had to take 75% of it home. The ambiance was very cute and the lighting made it a perfect spot for a date. This spot has solidified itself for top of my list and I will be returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/monsieur-vo-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ordered a bunch of dishes including the banh mi board, monsieur platter, roasted bone marrow, ba's grilled shrimp, com chien cua, and the beef shank. Banh mi board came out first, and boy, it was delicious. Basically a deconstructed banh mi. Monsieur platter was good too, but wasn't anything amazing. The shrimp and bone marrow were exceptional and everyone at the table agreed. The plate that didn't really impress me was the beef shank. It was bland and lacked flavor for me, and my fiance agreed.

Peter V.,/user_details?userid=NAf51WR2445lhYXtn8C1VQ,"New York, NY",12/1/2022,4.0,I had a good experience here with a couple of nitpicks that are really just personal preferences. The marrow has a nice salty texture on the surface. It has a nice kick and might be a little too salty on it's own but the baguette cuts it very nicely. The crispy rice did crispy rice things and that Vietnamese sausage and anchovy had that bacon effect (where it just makes things better). The okra was flavorful but i like my fried Okra to not be so wet - i would have preferred the dressing to be a dip. I'll eat this place again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/monsieur-vo-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

What's better than the space is the food. This was easily some of the best Mediterranean grub I've had in New York. It was hard deciding what to order because everything sounded amazing - they have a veg-friendly menu chocked full with salads, sandwiches/wraps, bowls, etc. - but I opted for the baked falafel bowl, complete with delicious roasted vegetables on a bed of rice, served with dolmas (my favorite).

I ordered a large late lunch from Bedford Gardens and liked that there were multiple options to choose from: Pho, dumplings, sushi, boba tea, etc. I ordered the Taro Milk tea m, which was tasty, but there was not enough ice and it was quite sweet (more so than just other Taro milk teas I have gotten). It would have been nice to have some customization like at I'Milky. I also ordered the soup dumplings - scallop and pork. I was not a fan of them not offering vinegar and ginger for a standard soup dumpling sauce. I tried to get the hostess's attention but I think she was overwhelmed by the lunch rush. I really missed the ginger and the dumplings were...eh. Maybe a little bland and could have used something. The sushi was very fresh. I enjoyed the toro and salmon avocado lunch special rolls.

I was fortunate enough to try this new restaurant last week and the first impression I got was: wow this place is very clean! It may be because they opened not too long ago, but they managed to have very clean and nice lookin restaurant. They also have a very cute garden area in the back, but the only downside was that there were mosquitoes. Anyways, I got to try the momo sampler, chirashi bowl, Giant eel roll and egg custard. First of all, sushi was very fresh and they gave good portion. The Giant eel roll deserved the name giant as it came with big eel on top of the roll, which is usually not the case in other restaurants.

The dumplings to start with were a sampler of chicken, potato, beef and pork. The pork and beef were standouts but the chicken was delicious and the potato was like a steamed samosa, and so delicious. Our main course was a headless shrimp boil and chicken wings. I would definitely come back for the boil - the shrimps were delicious and the sauce was the right amount of heat and salt but not overbearing. The added corn, potato and sausage were fun surprises! My partner wanted to pass along the corn was her favorite part! The price on the boil is very reasonable and we got a lot of shrimp! The wings were no slouch either. They were perfectly fried and so dang delicious. The dessert was the egg custard and was so good, we got one to go! Half off after 5 pm too!

Of course, the name itself is deceptive because this is not really a food hall: it's a restaurant with four different cuisines on offer.  We only tried the momos- beef and pork were good, chicken and veggie were bland- and the sushi, because the waitress curiously steered me away from the shrimp boil that I had been considering. I'm glad she did because the fish was cut so beautifully in the sushi entree and was extremely flavorful, and there was an ample serving of different varieties of fish. It was accompanied by a tuna roll made from nice pieces of tuna. Husband had a shrimp mango roll, which had lovely chunks of tasty shrimp that were not overwhelmed by the mango, and a yellowtail jalapeño roll with tobiko on top that he was extremely happy with. I was too full from my sushi to try a piece.  If you are comfortable dining indoors, sit in their back room-  essentially an enclosed garden that's absolutely delightful. I am only holding off from giving this place 5 stars because I have only been there once and they also were not yet fully operational (liquor license pending and no dessert option the night that we were there).  I'll definitely be back though when I find myself in Williamsburg for something.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bedford-gardens-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

In fairness, the manager will make you a gin and tonic or a martini but that is about. There wine list is very simple, Red or White. The dim sum now seems to be brought in from outside rather than being made in house. With that said, xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) are very good. The rest of the food is also pretty good too except that the sweet and sour pork is made from a very poor cut of pork. Seems to me that they are cutting too many corners.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/xus-public-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Which then I asked, is it the same price? How much will that be for 50 people? (Thinking there might be a price variance given that there are less people) which he then answered ""I already told you it's 35!"" And remarked something in Chinese thereafter. What comes next? He hangs up.

Food is an A+, service is an A+, interior design A+ and pricing A+. Xu's Public House is a hybrid between Chinese traditional dishes such as dim sum and soup dumplings, with an American flare. So far I've been here twice (once for lunch and once for dinner) and each time, I try to order something different since their menu is bountiful. I really enjoyed their truffle dumplings, porn buns and dim sum items. When you come for dinner, they provide you with complimentary Hong Kong cakes to start!

Immediately you can tell from the decor and setting at Xu's, the owner's  ambition for an Asian-inspired fine dining experience. Overall, the atmosphere is amazing.

For main course we had King Crab cold noodle with sea urchin-- a taste of summer, I'd say, which reminds me of the good old days by the sea.

Melissa H.,/user_details?userid=2VNb5XLyIfy6S5FG2ma6CQ,"Manhattan, NY",9/1/2019,5.0,"This brand new restaurant nearby union square is bound to be a gem once people step inside its doors and realize how incredible it is. The flavors of the food blew our minds, because the attention to detail and quality ingredients really shows. Not sure where to start because everything we had was amazing. My favorite dishes were the uni pastry (buttery uni topped onto a sweet flaky layered pastry) and Orange shrimp (crispy and huge shrimps with a tasty orange sauce). We also loved the Yangchow fried rice. It's made steamed instead of being cooked in a rice cooker which maintains the natural shape and flavors  of rice. This is just an example of how the extra time they put into the quality of the food really pays off. Other things to mention that we're top of the line - steamed egg topped w caviar, tiger prawn and lobster risotto, morchella esuelenta soup dumpling, squid ink shrimp dumplings, five elements tea. Last thing to mention of course is the beautifully designed interior and incredible service. We can't wait to be back as this spot really exceeded our expectations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/xus-public-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Started off the meal with their Khinkali Soup Dumplings. Overall pretty good, although I will say the dumpling wrappers were a bit on the thicc-side. The Mushroom Penovani was great, so much oozy cheese! We asked our server what the best cheeseboat was and he suggested the Steak'n'Egg which is apparently their most popular one. It was pretty good, they really load these boats with cheese. The green cilantro sauce was served with everything which I really liked. Everything we ordered had a very strong umami flavor profile which felt a little redundant by the last dish we got. The green cilantro sauce was the real MVP.

We tried phkhali, which was ok, and beef kabab which came with veggies and was a bit overpriced for the size ( 25$) and flavor. Overall, I remembered they served better food in the past.

My friend and I showed up on a Friday night (during COVID) without a reservation, and there was a slight wait, but by the looks of the food on the tables, I insisted we wait it out and try this place. And boy was that a good decision! Having never heard of a cheeseboat or tried Georgian spice, I was in for a treat. To start off, we ordered a shot of the ""adios don"" and the meat dumplings. They bumped our shot up to a full martini, which inspired the other patrons in our area to order the ""adios don"". Then, we all cheers'd (6 feet apart, air-clinking our glasses of course) that the inauguration was only 2 weeks away!! Adios!! Then came the dumplings. I couldn't get enough - I would have ordered another plate of them if our cheese boats didn't arrive at that moment. For 2 people, I'd say 2 cheese boats is quite the challenge and will result in left overs. We tried the brie and honey boat, as well as the steak and eggs boat. I truly can't pick a favorite - both were incredible in unique ways. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare; it was unbelievably juicy and it wasn't even the main event!! We joked that the Brie boat made a good dessert as it's on the sweeter side. The bread for the boats was so warm and just what we needed on a chilly night.

We also shared the spinach cheese boat with truffle butter. It was really good. We enjoyed it. My friends had the cheese soup dumplings and they enjoyed them. I'm giving them 3 stars for service. They didn't have enough wine glasses so they used different glasses. Not all the glasses matched. Also the spacing of the courses was off.

My girlfriend and I shared the original Cheeseboat and the Shkmeruli Chicken Cheeseboat and both were cheesy, flavorful and delicious. We actually finished both because we were starving, but if you're not that hungry, I'd recommend getting one to split between two people and maybe an appetizer, as they really are filling.

Friday was all day happy hour :) I was starving so I had the pirozhki and the house white which was 15$ for a yummy cheese mushroom and tarragon sandwich. The food came out fairly quickly and the presentation was spotless, wood plates and had a very rustic feel to it. The spinach cheeseboat was the star of the show, A cheese fondue inside a bowl made out of crunchy and warm bread. The service was pretty good, although nearing the end it started to take a while so we had to call waiters over. Overall service was good and the food was excellent. I had never tasted Georgian food, I'm glad it turned out to be so delicious. I'll be back.

Let me just explain that I am one of the most patient people and last night pushed that patience to the limit. My sister and I walked in at 6:15pm to an empt restaurant. There were only a few other people there-- mostly finishing up their meals. We were sat by a man who spoke zero english but was clearly doing this best. The waiter was this young kid who took 15 minutes to come over and take our drink order. By then 2 other tables had come in, waited and left because they were not greeted. We proceeded to order the spinach Cheeseboat and an appetizer knowing the wait for the food would be up to 30 mins. After only 20 mins a table who came in around the same time  got their food so I told the waiter to cancel the app. He looked very confused like... What app? Another 20 mins past, and the table behind us that came in a half hour after us got their food. Then another table, then another. Finally I asked the waiter how much longer and he said he never put it in and would comp us. I asked for bread because at this point we were starving. He said it would be 10 mins. 45 MINS LATER... no food. We walked out after waiting 2 HOURS!!!! I have never in my life experienced this before. I went to bed without dinner because it was 9pm and too late to do this all over again. I want to mention that the poor guy who spoke no english wanted to help but couldn't meanwhile two women gabbed behind the bar never helping the waiter. The food coming out to all the other tables looked great. Im sure it tastes great too but this was the worst service I have ever experienced and is WHY I took to Yelp. I'm still mad about it a day later and that is very much not my personality.

You can tell the restaurant was understaffed, there were about 3 people working the floor meanwhile the entire restaurant was filled with people. We ordered the eggplant appetizer and when it came out, it was freezing cold and under seasoned. Our waiter (the only male with blonde hair) asked how the food was so far and I made a comment how we were a little disappointed that 1) the eggplant was cold and should probably be a warm dish, and 2) it was under seasoned. His response was, ""Well, that's just the way it is. It's supposed to be like that"" in a dismissive and rude tone. Not only did he not apologize, but his overall attitude was just unprofessional. The girl next to me tried to get his attention to order another drink and from afar, he raises his finger and says ""YOU HAVE TO WAIT ONE SECOND."" Not to mention right after he does this, he chugs an entire glass of champagne. Ugh. We ordered the mushroom cheese boat and it was pretty tasty. Based on the other reviews, the cheese boats all sound delicious but based on the service and staff alone, I'll never come back here again (especially with all the other food options in the neighborhood) and I'll make sure to warn my friends not to go or order from there as well.

Katchapuri with spinach is lighter than the traditional version, so you can go as light or decadent as you want (bacon). (I had the spinach.)  And the three dips with the house-made bread are unexpected and interesting. I'm always looking for new flavor combinations and this place has plenty to keep me happy and wanting to return. The place is cozy and there is a real positive family vibe here. We stopped in out of curiosity just to try it while visiting our son in Williamsburg which, in my opinion, is brunched out. We were pleasantly surprised and will  be back for sure, from the wilds of NJ. And for the record, katchapuri is as yummy and comforting as pizza.

Kristen M.,/user_details?userid=gPmRcFdrfZIiO7CVQaQDfw,"New York, NY",12/13/2017,2.0,"My friends had been to this restaurant once before and they said the service was terrible, the waitress was rude, and the food took forever to arrive. I'm not sure why we decided to return (I guess a bread boat filled with melted cheese sounds appealing). The food was decent, but the experience was awful. First, it was extremely and uncomfortably warm in the restaurant--the heat was turned up way too high! The restaurant was completely empty but our waiter pretty much ignored us until we flagged him down to place our order, which he didn't write down (a bad sign). He talked us into ordering a $20 ""jar of wine"" (drink special). The white wine we received seemed to be very watered down (but I guess that's what you get for $20). Our cheeseboats came pretty quickly and were actually very tasty. However, after waiting for over an hour, the other food we ordered still had not arrived. We flagged down the waiter again, who didn't remember what we ordered (surprising, considering the restaurant was still almost empty). He apologized and said that the chicken would take another 15 minutes and the salmon would take longer. It was clear that he had not put in the order for our other food. As we were still pretty hungry, we decided to wait for the chicken, but cancelled our other order. He brought us a free jar of wine while we waited another 30 minutes for our chicken to arrive. The whole meal was fairly cheap split between 6 people, but it wasn't enough food and we all left feeling kinda hungry. I think you can probably find better Georgian food and much better service elsewhere.

The service here was a little different than what I've experienced at other restaurants-- at most other places I've been to, servers are assigned a specific section of tables, but on this particular night at least, all servers seemed to be helping with all tables.  This may contribute to other reviews I've seen mentioning slow service.  Getting our meals and the check was a tad slow, but we didn't mind since we weren't in a rush and the servers were really friendly and helpful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cheeseboat-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The crudo was a d-grade salmon likely bought at city acres next door. Not thoughtfully dressed or plated. And the laziest deviled eggs with hard boiled yolks still in tact.

My boyfriend and I made a reservation for 8:00 PM when we arrived the hostess told us that their bigger party was running late so our table wasn't quite ready which was fine with us, we were in no rush. She had us sit at the bar and we had a drink while we waited. We only waited for our table for about 10 minutes, then we were seated. We ordered the Cesar salad which was delicious, the dressing was homemade. My boyfriend ordered the chicken, and I ordered the braised short ribs. Both were very good. The drinks were also delicious, I will post the picture above. When we got the bill we noticed that our first two drinks weren't on there, we asked what was the hostess but come to find out also the owner and she said it was on them for making us wait, which I thought was very nice and really not even necessary since we didn't wait long but very good hospitality. The owner was so friendly, she told us all about their new endeavor and told us a couple of other bars to go to. I would 100% come back, and would give the whole experience a 5 star rating!

It isnt the servers fault since she was covering a bunch of tables but as the customer it isn't fair to pay an automatic 20% tip when the server was not attentive nor did she offer water or utensils for our table we had to keep requesting for something as simple as napkins. But they included tip automatically even tho it was just a party of 3. So yea might just order take out from here but never dining in.

But, personally I felt fine and not like a stuffed pig by the end. This is quality over quantity and I am ok with that. The neo-Scandinavian food is seafood heavy. But, each bit is refreshing and flavorful and unique. Inspired sauces and flavors drawn from nature rather than pounding the food with spices. This really lets the ingredients sing. I left pictures and am not going to say what was best, because every dish was solid. In fact what was most impressive was that the meal built. Each dish flowed into the next and in a way was better then the last. It was a truly harmonious meal. Worth the splurge for a special occasion. Only wish is that they had liquor and cocktails but not a big deal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aska-brooklyn-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Enjoyed the first dish (on kelp) and ice cream dessert less than other courses. Food arrived at a comfortable pace; usually a few minutes between each of 14 courses and about a half-dozen paired drinks. As aesthetic as it was delicious, to the extent that, for a few courses, it seemed premature for the servers to immediately cover the artpiece with sauce/etc. Maybe a solution is to ask the customer whether they'd want to pour it themselves. Nonetheless, impeccable coordinated service. Environment and scenery feel NYC-esque (more condensed and low-key than one may expect). Overall an impressive, unique, unforgettable meal.

There was only one other couple downstairs, it was very intimate and cozy. The cocktail was obviously great, syrupy and smooth. We were called upstairs to our table before we finished our drinks. For the night, we opted for the full dinner menu and a drink pairing. The food was good but not as light and fresh as I was expecting for a summer visit to a Scandinavian restaurant. I thought a number of their dishes had very heavy oils that turned my stomach a bit. I am still giving them 4 stars because my bf did not agree and so this might have been a preference issue. There were some true gems offered with the drink pairing, but I have learned a lesson. I drink far more than beverage pairings offer. The waiter gave us a few ""free"" pours just because we had finished the drinks before the food got there. We never have the intention of getting drunk, but I always find myself straining to stretch those few teaspoons of fine wine. Finally, I begrudge myself for saying this, but the waitstaff was awkward. He attempted multiple times to have a conversation with us, which was fine, but his comments felt extremely perfunctory and structured. With the stringent beverage pours and the awkward staff, we felt the place was too stuffy to warrant a return for now.

We tried walking in on a Friday night and while we expected a long wait, we didn't expect to keep getting passed over for reservations that were showing up literally hours early. One example: we put our names down at 7:30 and after we waited about 30 minutes, another couple came in and asked if they could be seated for a 9:30 reservation. They were seated pretty much immediately. This kept happening, so we eventually gave up and came back on a weekday night with a reservation. Food and wine are excellent, but reservations are a must, especially since they'll just seat you whenever you show up as long as you have one.

Immediately when you come in you feel like you're transported into a grungy alley way/garden. The ambient lighting and music sets the mood. Ordering was a piece of cake. You could go to the counter or scan the QR code on a table and order/check-out from your phone. We ordered the General Tso's fried cauliflower with garlic fried rice to start. It was a perfect combo. The sauce was sweet and the cauliflower had a nice crispy batter to it. It complimented the garlic fried rice very well. The rice could've used some butter and a little more soy sauce though. The fries were crispy and meaty. The last item were the steak tapa nachos. The fried flour chips were perfect and crunchy, drizzled with the addicting sauce. I asked for extra sauce on the side and big Phil gave me the whole bottle! The steak was cooked perfectly and was not chewy at all. I was warned that the cocktails were no joke. We got the mai tai and mango margarita. They were so good and strong at the same time. I was feeling nice after one drink! I can't wait to go back and try all their other items.

Our entree of the beef and the surf and turf was not enough for two people. Me and my friend ordered more. The staff was super friendly. So we ordered another appetizer and entree. The octopus and shrimp entree with the foie gras appetizer. We still think the appetizers were the best part of the dinner. The entrees were disappointing. The lava cake dessert was more like a chocolate bread with tiny bit of chocolate inside. The music was a bit loud and it felt like we were in a club. Hard to hear each other. The surf and turf the scallops were warm but the pork belly on it was cold. The size of the octopus in the entree was tiny compare to the salad.

I also got the kir royal french cocktail to drink. I really enjoyed everything but I actually wasn't too crazy about the duck crostini. The duck crostini was more of an aged duck on top of the bread with a good dallop of honey. The baked camembert with mushroom and truffle oil was soo good. Melty cheese with a good amount of mushroom and the delectable taste of truffle. The steak was also really good and the mashed potatoes that came along with it were soft and yummy!

However last time I went there with my friend - 2 weeks ago..I had the worst experience with the bartender. My friend and I enjoyed our first round of drinks and asked for a second, the bartender (I forget his name now, but he had dreadlocks) makes my friend their drink. 10 min later I ask for my drink, he gets angry and throws out my friends drink because I couldn't tell he was busy. I shouldn't have to wait an additional 10 minutes after my friends drink was made to have my drink and by no way should a bartender take your drink and throw it out. Even if they are having a bad day this is unacceptable.

There seemed to only be two people working the whole restaurant doubling as host and waiters, and it just was too much. I had a reservation and they almost didn't seat us, saying they were full, but they finally gave us a table. We then put in an appetizer and drinks, which was fine. When we ordered our main courses, we sat waiting for almost 2 hours. We tried to flag down a waiter to ask to check on our food, but it took them far too long to check on us. When they did, they told us they forgot to put our food in. They gave us one free round of drinks, but I really think we should've gotten a discount or anything because we were there for so long and hungry.

The board was a huge portion size, with generous amount of meats and cheese. The Brie paired with the honey was a match made in heaven! The Savoyard flambée was also delicious. The cheese melted in your mouth but the flat bread maintained its crispy crunch. The escargot came out piping hot and delicious. Surprisingly, it had a more parsley/lemony taste that was amazingly fresh and savory. Lastly, the chocolate cake was rich and decadent (but not too sweet) and was the perfect end to our meal.

My husband also ordered escargot as an appetizer and had trouble getting one of the snails out of the shell - so they brought him another whole round on top of what he ate.

Jim S.,/user_details?userid=YhdXYhX2VC4SgixBH3ernQ,"New York, NY",3/1/2020,4.0,One of the newer restaurants on the area with a Mexican flair. I have to say the food looks great and is presented well. Unfortunately we came between lunch and dinner and can only get appetizers and drinks. I had the quesadilla which was beautifully presented and tasted excellent. We also tried the nachos again presentation was great but honestly I didn't like the homemade chips. Though corn based they were slightly over fried and missing some of the rich flavor. Regular margarita was fine but most of the custom drinks had soda. Some more than others. For an 11 dollar drink I don't want soda. We might be back for dinner. More of a university hipster crowd of young people.

I understand that some people in the neighborhood still hold a grudge over French Roast closing down in this space, but I can't think of a better new tenant than this.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-contenta-oeste-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The co-owner was a total jerk to me and my entire group of friends.

So, apparently hugging and saying hello to your friends is something you can only do at a dive bar!??? Wtf. If I want to get speciality cocktails, I will walk over to my favorite spot Clover Club, where I feel welcomed and always have an enjoyable time. Even after the owner was rude we stayed for a while and spent well over $100 on drinks and he was STILL spewing snarky comments. For a bar that JUST opened in a very populated neighborhood, you'd think the owners would be nicer.

Very knowledgeable people working here. Okay so the beef tongue: this is a level of heat that works for me; in other words I seek out the heat. But I am impressed this is on the menu, as I would bet most people can't handle this level of heat. The tongue is fine enough, but the curry sauce is deep. Hot. I challenge you, heat seekers, to come and order this. We also ordered the pork belly curry, which is a lovely compliment to the beef tongue. The cocktails were also notable - mezcal Passionfruit and the dealbreaker - both very tasty.

The food was great and it wasn't too spicy. For dessert, we ordered the Peach Melba which was very delicious and the Kabocha Cream Cone. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the portion size were small.

I will say that we were not warned that the dishes were spicy however, every dish was quite spicy, some more than others. The fish golae sauce was amazing but spicy, the pork jowl relish was good, has a bit of culantro in it which i had mixed feelings about since I'm not a cilantro fan (sister of culantro). But the flavors were good and it wasn't a strong taste and i love the crudités it came with - such as apples, grapes and Brussel sprouts.

Alan C.,/user_details?userid=bXe7lht8dWGCVxhfxk9cBw,"Menlo Park, CA",11/22/2022,4.0,"Interesting restaurant. Was in town for the upcoming holidays and visiting with my son who lives nearby and had wanted to try this place. I noted the seemingly limited menu options but we booked a table and gave it a go the other night. First off I think the food was thoughtfully worked out and for sure it was interesting but I must admit I thought there was a disconnect between the food served and the prices for the various items. The starter shrimp dish worked out to be a single item only for two people - so we had to double the order (and the cost) for what was one tiny shrimp per person. Tasty but hardly worth the cost IMHo. The salads and dips where also an interesting next course and despite what I thought was going to be a glorified crudités with a dip the two dishes we ended up with there actually highlights for the meal. The hog jowl dip was my personal favorite including a bunch of veggies and some crispy fish to crumble on top and the second one was a very spicy paste with veggies and some crusty shrimp you crumbled on top. These were both tasty. The curries were limited options and quite spicy - the beef tongue was not something I'd order again but my partner liked it and the highlight was the lobster Curry but once again it was a small portion in a bowl for almost $40. We also had the veggie curry which was full of potatoes making its price (almost $30) for a tiny bowl once again a fact that made me pause. The restaurant is in a garage that seems to not have heating that circulates well - so despite being seated far from the entrance we were ice cold the entire meal. Making the option of a rice milk based cream scoop desert an odd but tasty close to the meal. With a few beers and mostly waters our bill for four exceeded $320 which I don't think was honestly worth the $$$. Nice folks, interesting take on Thai food but not sure small $30-40+ dollar bowls of curry are something I'd return for. This old hipster will head back to SF and find other Thai food for much less $$$ and so I can eat more than a single shrimp in a lettuce leaf.

Everyone enjoyed the meal taste-wise! I had ordered the pineapple fried rice, hoping it was going to come in a pineapple like the photo, but it didn't. That was the only upsetting part. Other than that, we're definitely coming back to visit! When I come by myself, I will definitely be ordering more than we did during our visit. I felt like I needed to experience more but we had all gotten full very fast! I didn't get many photos and took more videos... whoops! If curious to see my video, you can find it on IG at @ashrafeats. If not, enjoy the two photos of the Peking duck.

Tanya H.,/user_details?userid=EyxIGr0nzrPs-EwDYepymg,"New York, NY",5/29/2021,5.0,"The dim sum is made fresh here, and that makes the high prices worth it. It's not overpowering or heavy, unlike other dimsum places where it feels like you're eating buckets of salt/msg. I like that they make chicken shumai here, it's not a strong but comfortable and homey flavor. The congee has many big chunks of meat and pidan. The chashu bun is super fluffy, with yummy sweet meat filling. I would say that the soup dumplings have a thicker, chewier and less artfully folded skin than what you might get at a true soup dumpling restaurant, perhaps since this isn't a Shanghainese establishment but rather Canto. That said, the soup inside is savory and light, and you can tell the skin was housemade, it's still good. The auntie and waitstaff treated us well, and our food was brought out at a good pace. I would come again and try the other dim sum items in a heartbeat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-9?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Susanna M.,/user_details?userid=6bM_FqFaOzdwJQy8g_NuCA,"New York, NY",7/28/2021,5.0,"So, I'm finally reviewing Dim Sum Palace after going here since 2018. I grew up eating dim sum with my mom and going on trips home to Taiwan. This is my favorite location of the local chain and the best place you can go in the East Village for dim sum. Tim Ho Wan can not compare (like really, why would you go there if you can go HERE?). When I lived in the east village I would go here minimum twice a month for dim sum and now that I've moved out of the neighborhood I still go out of my way to go here once a month. I would recommend it to anyone. It's affordable and you can't go wrong with their dim sum dishes. I typically go with one other person and get their har gow, shu mai, spare ribs, xiao long bao (soup dumplings), and typically supplement with one to two other dishes. On the weekends they have rice rolls so I definitely recommend getting those if you have the chance. They currently have an indoor and outdoor area to eat. The service is great and the food is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-9?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Pricing is pretty good. People working there are very pleasant. Szechuan Spicy Dumpling has a nice thin wrapper and is packed with a very tasty pork filling. The downside is the sauce, which is gloppy and a bit gelatinous. They would do better with a really good simple hot oil. The cold sesame noodles are very basic. The scallion pancake has a better than average taste and consistency. We did really enjoy the shrimp shumai; which had a very nice amount of shrimp.

The logo outside doesn't help too much, looks a bit basic and tacky but when you enter the restaurant it feel different. Nothing too luxurious or special but it's clean, interior design is nice and simple. A pretty comfortable environment. Not super big or small, just a good size and several tables and it's usually not packed at all. Speaks both mandarin and English. Good service..friendly staffs, attentive, doesn't rush you, doesn't assume you speak Chinese because you look like one, and honestly pretty great prices. Quite a few different options for dim sum but they do have other Chinese dishes from appetizers, meat/veggies, to noodles or rice. A couple desserts and beverages too. Tasty food and nice texture. The Braised Five Spice Duck looks simple but tastes really nice and it's not too dry either. My friend wasn't a big fan on the bamboo shoot dumplings but I find it okay, doesn't have the ""wow"" factor but it's simple and light so good for the stomach. The steamed spare ribs w/ olive sauce was one of my favourite. Shrimp dumpling is like most places so nothing too special but they tastes good. Chicken feet was nice too. Shu Mai (shrimp and pork) was definitely my friend's favourite,:$3 almost wanted a second one. Is portion is perfect for the both of us.

I've had some of the best dim sum in Tai Pei, San Fran, and in Vancouver, and this place come in very very close. First off, each dish was fresh and meticulously made. When a chef takes pride in his/her creation, it definitely shows and tastes amazing. My wife, who is a finicky eater, even liked it here. As with many NY restaurants, this place is fairly small but the decor and the ambiance was nice. Table cloth was a nice touch and the it was clean overall. I usually don't care about the ambiance of a restaurant unless it's a special occasion but it's worth mentioning.

To be honest, the environment is clean and service is good, however this couldn't help to raise the overall rating because their dim sum is below average. We ordered a couple dumplings to start, and the skins are too think while the fillings are all flavorless. We then tried the radish cake, and there is way more corn stretch than radish, making it soggy and flavorless. We also ordered the rice roll and the beef tasted dry as if you just heat up some frozen meat. No flavor again aside from the soy sauce. Their congee is also too over cooked that you can't really taste the texture of the rice. If you want congee, Congee Village or any other classic dim sum place in Chinatown would offer much better options. The congee is faThe best would be the taro bun and sesame balls filled with taro. Overall we will not come back again because they couldn't even get the most basic dim sum dishes right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-9?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The siu mai were delicious with nice thin wrappers filled with big plump pieces of shrimp. I was pleasantly surprised as usually siu mai are mainly filled with pork rather than shrimp. My favorite dish was definitely the egg custard buns. The buns themselves were fluffy and soft and filled with a gooey perfectly sweet egg custard. So good and definitely a must order.

We got the Ugly Dumplings (beautiful flavor! fried and filled with japchae), Mentaiko Stir-fried Noodle (the kid's favorite :-) ), Sesame Crabmeat Soup (recommended by our server -- addictive!), Lamb Bulgogi (unusual and tasty), Beef Belly (so tender and savory -- my favorite of the night), Kimchi Musubi (little rice bites that were very cute and tasty), and both desserts, the Popping Star (an ice cream sundae with pop rocks) and the Cocoball Bingsu (loved this one in particular -- the earl grey tea ice base was so nice).

Everything was so good but the fried skate is NOT TO BE MISSED!  The outside is crispy and crunchy, the meat was heafty yet light and broke apart like crab meat. It was just ::chefs kiss:: phenomenal. We both raved about how perfect that dish was.  We had a 730 pm dinner and didn't realize they had karaoke after.

Food was a 6.75/10, sushi itself was good and fresh but nothing ground breaking. The serving sizes were small. The wine serving size was outrageous.

On top of that the two ladies in our party of 4 got the lychee cocktail which is a sleeper of a drink if one ever did exist because it tasted like straight juice. Then I got the Suntory beer.

Christina M.,/user_details?userid=awvUoM_YS0SRiCctFiefeA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/30/2022,5.0,"Had a great experience for lunch at Momoya SoHo. I made a reservation in advance on resy for a Thursday lunch, during the holidays. The host was very welcoming and my friend and I were seated right away. The restaurant itself is very refined and the decor is great (especially the small touches of holiday decor). For appetizers we ordered the wagyu beef tataki which was very tender and the ponzu sauce was a nice touch. For lunch my friend and I ordered the sushi and sashimi combo which comes with one roll choice ( I got yellowtail and she got spicy salmon) four pieces of sushi and four types of sashimi with two pieces for each type. We also had a choice of soup or salad. The sushi and sashimi was very fresh and of good quality. It's a fine lunch option and for the quality you get I would say it's worth it although there are cheaper sushi lunch options (but you get what you pay for, and for soho this is a good deal). For drinks we got a lychee cocktail and it was sweet and refreshing (could only taste a hint of alcohol which I actually preferred). For dessert we split the seasonal dessert which was the ""Tsuru No Ongaeshi"" -White Wine Gelée, Ginger White Chocolate Ice Cream, Clementine Sorbet, Lemon Verbena Espuma, Apricot Shiratama, Rare Cheesecake, Genmai Crumble, Kinmoku-sei. It was very intricate and there were several layers of flavors to it. At $28 it is definitely on the pricier side but it is an experience and worth while if you are splitting it with at least one other person. I'm curious to try the other seasonal desserts available as the winter parfait was delicious and light.

I stopped by after doing some birthday shopping on a Friday. I was alone and was in a great mood, Soon as i walked in the host greeted me and was very pleasant i sat at the bar and couldn't stop checking out the details ""it was eye appealing""  the aesthetic was everything u would want your Friday after work to be like and feel because the music was on point and i was smiling because i was enjoying every moment. The bar tender came he was very basic gave me a menu and i placed my order. My drink was pretty good and i was happy that i order something simple and it came out in a timely fashion. I noticed the bartender was very short with me not much smiling or conversation and that's okay but the service he gave the other guess was by far what i expected. He asked what was they food allergies and what was the mood they was going for because it seem like we all wasn't sure on what to order ""it was many great options"" I did love that for them so i was upset my service was so dry. Things did change i ordered the seasonal dessert and I'm not sure if he was the manager and i hope he was because he did a great job putting a smile back on my face. Every detail about the dessert was explained and how to eat it as well  i felt that the money i spent was about to be worth it.

When we got our check we waited like 30-45 and the lady never went to get it. The man did instead and we wished we gave him our tip.

So when she made us pay another way instead, we paid in cash and she awkwardly stood there waiting for us to give her more cash for her tip. We told her to just take the payment for the bill first and we would leave a tip on the table. Weirdest service encounter any of us ever had! We had to ask for a dessert menu and she literally never checked on us.

Then my husband ordered 2 more pieces of fatty tuna and same waitress brought out uni. She again apologized and said, ""not sure what's wrong with me tonight?"" We also ordered sparkling water and a gentleman refilled our glasses with tap while our sparkling was still in our glass.

Loraine A.,/user_details?userid=voiynBHN_PRCZT2n85ZTCA,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",11/21/2022,1.0,The octopus was chewy and the tomatoes in the salad were not fresh. Tasted old and had no flavor. We were sat in a corner with a bunch of flies. We asked to be sat in another table but the hostess was not helpful and end up ignoring our request. The waiter lacked enthusiasm. I wanted a cocktail but they did not have two of the ingredients needed for the drink. I keep seeing reviews on the different social media platforms about how good the food is! But my experience was COMPLETELY different.

The location was beautiful, and I even called to ensure they had availability before I headed there. Knowing it was a Friday night, it would be busy, so I figured going there a little after the dinner rush would be perfect. The person on the phone said to come in about 20-30 minutes, and we can get a table for two. I went online to make a reservation for the slot in 30 minutes. We arrived on time and understood there was a wait since I booked the reservation too close to when I'd arrived. I told the hostess that I would wait by the bench so I don't block the entrance because I understood. Sadly, 20 more minutes went by and all the other people standing outside (who came after us) were seated except for us. When I looked at the hostess, they just walked away and I felt I was not welcomed. There were two hostesses, so it's not like they were understaffed. Both were equally demeaning. So after 30 minutes on top of the original 30 minutes wait, I decided to go elsewhere. I got an email from OpenTable that I didn't show up, which was not true.

I was so disappointed couldn't continue to enjoy the wonderful drinks. I had to keep waving my hands around for the flies to fly away. How is this possible?

Food was absolutely delicious, we ordered jumbo shrimp cocktail, pita with traditional dips, saganaki cigars, grilled flying octopus, and lamb chops.

I knew it was brand new and was prepared to expect a few hiccups as the restaurant finds its rhythm but I left so incredibly impressed. Everything was absolutely top notch. I used to work in the restaurant industry and I know about all the behind-the-scenes chaos that can happen. There was no evidence of any of that at l'abeille. I sat at a table that had a great view of the kitchen and the team worked so well together and appeared really collaborative. So naturally, this led to perfectly executed dishes! My friends and I ordered different dishes so we could try most of their opening menu. Our highlights were the foie gras with mango chutney appetizer (the layer of charred mango on top of the foie gras is genius) and the fish. The bouillabaisse served with the fish was soooo tasty. The a la carte dishes are reasonably priced, especially when you factor in the quality of service and the level of thoughtful detail throughout the restaurant. This will be a great place for a special occasion but I think it's also suitable for an elegant night out with girlfriends or to bring an out of town business client. Not a stuffy/super formal atmosphere.

The sprites look like ""Mexican"" soda but are actually just American- difference is that US sodas are made with high fructose corn syrup while the Mexican sodas use cane sugar. They have a sign listing all the toppings that the food comes with, but fail to mention pineapple. Major let down for $4.75 per taco and $6.25 for a quesadilla that looks exactly the same as a taco.

Danny S.,/user_details?userid=lSZdRFG1RDcOMqGGMz-vtg,"San Gabriel, CA",1/9/2023,2.0,"They gave us some BS that their credit card machine wasn't working so its cash only, which should have a been a red flag to leave but we decided to give it a try still. They walked us through this lively upbeat dining room with loud music, karaoke on the TV, cool lights and ambiance, people drinking and having a good time. Then we turned the corner and went downstairs to eat in the bowels of the restaurant in a dark dingy room filled with the lovely sounds of clunk and clatter from the kitchen. The way you order here is you tell your server what you want, they punch it in an iPad (funny the iPads work but the CC machine doesnt), then you eventually get your food. I don't know why they didn't just give us the iPad.... Our server barely spoke any english which lead to many incorrect orders(I ordered a pitcher of Sapporo and got an order of fish balls) or some items just completely missing. Some other unfortunate souls were banished to dine in the dungeons with us. They kept sending their food to our table, we figured this out after getting a lot of things without ordering and realizing the other table had nothing after they ordered. The sauce bar down here matched everything else in the basement, dingy, dirty, disgusting. The spicy broth was pretty good here, lots of heat. The meat was not that great, once it touched the water it shriveled up and almost completely disintegrated as if it were a piece of foam to an open flame.

It's conveniently right by the rink and I've seen their dipped cones on Instagram so I decided to check it out. I ordered the seasonal special ice cream dipped cone the Grinch (eggnog custard ice cream, holiday sprinkles, wintergreen dip). It was adorable since it looked like a Christmas tree with a star on top (star is not edible, don't eat it haha). I like that it's in a plastic cone cover in case it gets messy. I'm not a fan of eggnog in general but the eggnog flavor wasn't too strong. I liked the crunchy chocolate shell. It wasn't messy at all as long as the ice cream doesn't melt too fast. There was a lot of indoor seating and there was a water station which was great.

I had their food truck bookmarked for a while but didn't get to go. I'm glad they opened this brick and mortar store. We came here after catching a movie at ipic. You order at the front of the store and then pick up there when ready. The food was actually prepared really quickly- especially the ice cream cones. I've been there a few times and they have a different monthly flavors for their ice cream. They're always really good but pretty messy- the plastic sleeve that they provide for the cones really help though! The burgers are great- on par with shake shack.

First and foremost, they have sanitizing stations throughout the inside of the restaurant and an outdoor area for eating with no chairs but high-top tables. They seemed short staffed and were still pushing orders out efficiently. However, I did not see anyone sanitizing tables after customers so you might want to come prepped with your own wipes. The food was a 7/10. I would probably only come back for the ice cream, the fries were my FAV. Oh, and the hot bae chicken strips were pretty much just dumped in honey. For two people we spent $50, which is pricey in my opinion for the amount of food we got.

Ramiah S.,/user_details?userid=LXMSm5MIQsoO7qPS_2vkWw,"Manhattan, NY",9/3/2022,4.0,"My first experience here was on Aug 28th when I was in the mood for some ice cream and stumbled across this store. I'm a plain jane when it comes to my ice cream so although the options look great, I went with a vanilla cone. It was soooooooo good! The first thing I noticed was how neat and full the cone looked and the second was how cold it was. You can literally see the frost coming from the ice cream as you eat it. My boyfriend tried the berry gibbs which ended up in the trash can after a few bites. The ice cream didn't taste like strawberry but more like berry and the outside red harden shell wasn't a good flavor either so that was money wasted, unfortunately. After letting him try some of my ice cream he loved it and went to order one for himself. A few days later we were in the area and decided to dine in for some food. We got the single dip burger, bbq bacon dip burger, dirty dipped waffle fries, a frozen lemonade, and the hot bae chicken tenders. Of course, after our meal, we had to end it with another delicious vanilla cone.  We were pleasantly surprised! The waffle fries were really good but would've been better with fresh fries as they were lukewarm with some pieces of suuuper old fries probably from throwing new batches onto old fries. I'd recommend them to properly dispose of old fries so there isn't a mixture of 3+ batches in there. My boyfriend looooved his bbq burger but the single dip burger didn't have much flavor so I wouldn't order it again. The hot bae tenders were fresh out of the oil and not too spicy as I had prepared myself for which was a plus because I don't like spicy foods. Frozen lemonade was ok and messy because it started to melt within seconds all over the table. We will definitely be back now that we know what we like and don't like. Plus the cashier Raheem (that's the name on the receipt) was super knowledgeable and friendly. I had like a million questions and he was very helpful in answering them.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mister-dips-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They actually served customers their food who ordered AFTER me. I would not go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mister-dips-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Angela F.,/user_details?userid=mWgy3rxzmKGPHIBSEFUDEQ,"Flushing, NY",6/20/2021,4.0,"I ordered a mint chocolate cone and some waffle fries with queso & scallions to share and they did not disappoint! I will say tho, especially on a sunny day, WATCH OUT because those cones are MESSY so take your pics quick and eat up! They were also running the limited edition pride cones at the time so lots of people were ordering that instead of the other cone options so my wait time was quite long compared to my friends & other people who ordered before me (who got the pride cone), around 10-15 minutes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mister-dips-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Raihan M.,/user_details?userid=HpCSWRuMDNx-NDbzPBpAHg,"New York, NY",1/11/2022,4.0,"Finally got to try Mister Dips recently! I had previously seen their ice cream pics on insta and I knew I had to try it. Got a chance to go with my gf and try two of their cones. It was cold outside but its never a bad time for ice-cream! We tried their limited ed ice cream for December which was ""The Grinch"". It had eggnog custard ice-cream with holiday sprinkles and wintergreen dip. It looked like a Christmas tree ice-cream and tasted ok. Our ice-cream cone didn't have a Christmas star but a ball...We were not a fan of eggnog ice cream. The second cone we tried was the  Chocolate Pbd with chocolate ice cream and salted peanut butter dip, chocolate ice cream and a peanut better cup. It tasted pretty good and we would definitely try it again. The location itself was pretty cozy compared to the weather outside. Next time we plan on trying their food alongside the ice cream. Overall I recommend this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mister-dips-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
