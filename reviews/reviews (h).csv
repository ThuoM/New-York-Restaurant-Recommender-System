Clari B.,/user_details?userid=LO_uLZ2ya4VC4JSXqzSFKA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/16/2021,4.0,"I might be biased because I love Luke's lobster joints. They're always fresh and don't have an overpowering flavor of whatever they put on it. I will say I did not care for the new thing they're doing with the lobster and pesto that flavor doesn't go at all and it feels really weird on the pallet. But their truffle version is delicious, super light with a hint of truffle that isn't too oil or buttery. I do wish that their lobster rolls were bigger considering the prices are far too expensive for what they offer in portion. Their mac & cheese is like less than a 2.5 ounce container and it cost $13 and tasted more like a seafood chowder base then mac & cheese and did I say it was $13 for what would be maybe an ounce container not even 2.5. Overall Luke's is a place to go only if you are looking to splurge and don't have the time to go to a sit down place which would cost you equally as much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The flavor of the lobster roll was really good but it was way overpriced. I didn't know their prices changed as I saw menu pics on yelp that were pretty recent that showed the roll being $22 for 6 oz. When I payed for my one lobster roll, the cashier told me my total was $38 which I couldn't even process until after I payed. Also, beware of the portions. I expected it to be a lot bigger because of the price and the price difference between the 4 oz and he 6 oz roll. I ended up killing the 6 oz roll in just a few bites.

George V.,/user_details?userid=gdqnQmnD7uso47q0sRl6sA,"Virginia Beach, VA",7/7/2018,4.0,Ran into this place since I was out near the Brooklyn Bridge. I normally wouldn't stop by because I thought it would be an overpriced tourist trap. Reviewing the price of the lobster roll ($18) it seemed about average from what I've seen. Ordered it as a combo with chips and a drink for about $23. Food was ready immediately and I was good to go. Luckily they have some tables outside right beside the building and actually an indoor dining area and restroom through the back door. The lobster roll I got had the mayo omitted (mayo is gross) but it still had butter and their special seasoning. I was kinda surprised that the lobster was cold since when it's in butter it's normally hot. It was fine though and tasted good. The roll looks small but they do pack quite a bit of lobster to satisfy most people. Don't think you can go wrong here if you're in the mood for a lobster roll.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I had the crab roll for $13, we also ordered the trio which allows you to try all three of their rolls (shrimp, crab, lobster) and the regular lobster roll. The buns here are more like a Texas toast- super buttery and delicious and holds up well to the meat.

Customer service was--as before--peppy, swift, efficient. But my main concern --the size of the lobster| roll for the price--was still uppermost in my mind as I ordered. Consulting my better angels, instead of lobster I chose a crab roll instead. Just on a whim. And I was very satisfied and pleased with it! This is what a lobster roll should be. Though the roll is the same size, the crab meat is stuffed into the bun in heaping, luscious portions. Much taller than the roll itself. It takes 8 or 9 bites to devour it and I mean full, mouth-filling bites.Jumbo lump crabmeat is one of my all-time fave seafoods and Luke's does a great job with this version.Really, it has much more taste-of-the-sea than does lobster here.

Just a perfect lobster roll.  Also love their selection of sodas, especially the blueberry soda which I was very surprised buy.  Had lobster rolls at a location in Manhattan and Brooklyn, and the quality was exactly the same both times!  Would definitely go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/lukes-lobster-brooklyn-bridge-park-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered a family style meal with spicy rice that complimentwd the chicken very well. The fries were absolutely delicious and we ordered a second serving. The chicken (both regular and wings) were perfectly cooked and moist. It was extremely flavorful. We tried the extra hot, which was too hot for me, but others in our party with higher heat tolerance loved them. My favorite was the Hot. It was tangy and had the perfect amount of heat that gave it a kick, but wouldn't kick your ass. The mango and lime was interesting and probably our least favorite, but it was still good.

One bad experience about here was they did not double bag our food. We literally got back home in front of our door and my bag ripped and all the food fell out. One of the thing we wouldn't save all of it. But the rest was able to save. I spent about $85 to almost lose all my food because of not double bagging it. It was only a 20 min walk. The food is heavy. Lemon herb and mango and lime were very interesting flavors. The mash potatoes first time i have seen yellow potatoes. It's good. Wonder how much butter they put in.

The food was fantastic, particularly the chicken (of course), the hummus and pita, and the french fries. It's a creative concept and they give you all the different sauces on the table so if you order something mild but want it hotter, each of the variations is on the table. The servers were all fantastic and super chatty. The owner is clearly so passionate about the concept and has a lot of pride in the restaurant. Lastly, it is BYOB and there is a fabulous wine store around the corner where we picked up a couple of bottles prior to dinner. They have wine glasses and a corkscrew so even though there is no alcohol, they are prepared with whatever you need.

Gary L.,/user_details?userid=iF7tBZ4swO39r2LF6-ZbYw,"New York, NY",12/28/2019,3.0,Nestled in New York city's avenue city you will find a Porto-esque chicken spot sealing your favorite spicy sauces. The extra hot is not spicy as they even stated that it's not hotter than sriracha. The Lamb was overdone and tough to chew and all the sauces taste very similar. All the sauces are actually on the table so if you order garlic you can try mango or lemon that's accessible. The local sodas was a nice touch. I would stick to chicken here and order the orange soda.

Sadia B.,/user_details?userid=LY9mPB_80ts-TfJ76npj8Q,"Queens, Queens, NY",2/29/2020,5.0,"Peri peri is a fairly new concept to NY, this place is doing it right. You have 6 sauces to choose from ranging from garlic and herb to mango lime and x-tra spicy. You also have the option of mixing sauces which is nice but you totally don't have to as every table comes with its own little jars of sauce. The burgers are actually chicken sandwiches but tasty non the less. Def a must try if you're craving super flavorful grilled chicken, not the run of the mill rotisserie.

The sauces were well described for the heat. The mild sauce was slightly too spicy for my child: the server noticed, without us asking and brought us complimentary milder chicken which my kid then enjoyed. The sides were good too as was the piña colada mocktail. We had a good tasting raspberry gelato as well. I would include pictures, but one minute after finishing, 5 gallons of rain water spilled onto my family and I from a collapsed tent roof. The server was so kind. She helped us rush all of our belongings indoors, went out into the rain and retrieved my wife's glasses from a puddle, and helped us dry off and offered us new masks.

Laurie S.,/user_details?userid=bewbNcbyR8QLmLfew6i34Q,"New York, NY",1/25/2020,3.0,"While we didn't eat in Frangos, we took out. The lamb chops were good, and covered with an extraordinary sauce, but I kept on wondering what they tasted like without. They seemed to have been cooked well. Not raw, but delightfully rare. Wings, on the other hand were incredible. Well cooked, and not ""hard"" which I find in most places serving them, probably because they were grilled, and taken off before becoming overdone. We ordered enough (8 chops, 15 wings) and paid enough to get two sides with each. Spicy fries were good, crispy, etc. Cauliflower was excellent, but such a tiny portion, not worth the plastic container they were in, same with the coleslaw. Sheesh... you'd think cabbage was gold, never mind the platinum carrots. While the flavors on both items were sensational, and we really did enjoy them, we would've expect the sides to be at least, double in size. They are extra$, and we were 3 people (2 men), and we were all pretty angry at the scarcity of the ""sides"". By the way, save yourself over $12 and pick it up yourself. Don't call Seamless because they charge a ton. I am going to the supermarket today and buying jerk seasoning and a huge pile of wings. Going to crisp them up in the oven with the seasoning, doused with olive oil. I can make coleslaw for next to nothing and be satiated, instead of spending $65! buyer beware.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/frangos-peri-peri-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Servers are very friendly and bubbly but what I found a bit frustrating, it was not uncommon that they were out if things or no longer making them. Either that night or its been removed. Or maybe I just asked for the wrong things? So they will ask you which sides you would like refilled, and then too often the response is, ""We don't have any more of that. Is there anything else you would like refilled? Sorry we are out of that one. Is there anything else..."". How abt start out saying what you are out of? This happened with my cocktail choice.

There are so many Mediterranean restaurants in the city that can serve as great tasting food as this one. However, this is the one that ruins your experience with their operations, services, and to top it off, with the manager. After our meal, we went through 40 minutes of 5 iterations of bills as they could not figure out the exact charge for our table. And when the manager finally came out, she was extremely arrogant and her first question (not an apology!) was, ""there is only $1 overcharge we did on your check, what is the problem here?"" although this was after their 3rd bill that overcharged 4 more drinks!! So it really did it for us. When she added further to say ""we have 2 servers covering all tables so there can be confusions but this is how all restaurants are nowadays"" we were thrown off at how arrogant and unprofessional she is as a manager.

Janette N.,/user_details?userid=1qcHyxzFw4ciKB76Ty5-7A,"Irvine, CA",3/3/2023,4.0,"Arguably the best udon bowl in NYC, but not the best I've had. We got the niku and ebiten udon. Personally, the niku udon did not live up to its hype. There was barely any pieces of meat in there and the broth was extremely oily, defeating the purpose of getting udon. It almost tasted like a taiwanese spicy beef noodle soup and for $20+ it was definitely not worth. The ebiten udon on the other hand was amazing. The texture of the udon noodle was so satisfying and the broth was so basic yet flavorful. I would definitely return for the ebiten but at this current price point, I'd chose marugame over raku.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Didn't realize it was cash only until we had to pay so thought I'd share the PSA. Now that that's out of the way, the food was absolutely incredible, probably some of the best udon I've ever had. Noodles were perfectly chewy and broth was rich and flavorful. Got some apps to start - fried chicken, an eggplant dish, and thick cut bacon. Thought the chicken was good, very crispy and the inside was buttery. The eggplant dish had a nice smoky flavor and was very unique! I'd skip the bacon. It was decent and honestly just a fatty pork belly, but nothing to write home about. The star of the show was of course the udon! Got the tantan. It was spicy and rich, but the broth wasn't too heavy. The noodles were super chewy which I loved! The peanuts made the broth nutty and umami. It was just so unique!!

I ordered the ja ja cold noodles and these might have been the best noodles I've ever eaten. The texture of the udon noodles has you wanting more because of how chewy and bouncy they were. The ja ja noodles are a great choice if you're looking for a refreshing yet full of unami flavor dish.  The flavors were unlike any I've ever tasted and the warm and cozy yet buzzling energy of the place makes you want to come back for a second round in the future. As a plus, they give the table some frozen grapes as a treat at the end of your meal.

Kate C.,/user_details?userid=p3DrBUO2TCjavIbgwevMAw,"The Heights, Jersey City, NJ",10/25/2022,3.0,Ya know what.... I'm gonna say it. Raku is overrated. We went on a rainy Sunday afternoon and placed our name on the list via Yelp and the table was ready when we arrived. We were seated outside and it was super cramped and when we asked about inside seating we were scolded and told there was nothing inside and to sit. That's fine.. service alright. We ordered the spicy niku and the gyunan. The spicy niku had two pieces of tripe and some short rib for $26. The tripe was delish and I wish there were more. The flavor did not transcend beyond any dimension to me but I did like the chewiness of the noodles. The spicy oil stuck to my throat and I feel didn't balance the way I wanted to and I love spicy soups!! The gyunan was homey and comforting but both udons felt like they were missing something. For the price point I feel like I wouldn't go again.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The noodles were also very fresh and bouncy. But I thought this niku was on the salty side. I'm used to marugame's sweet niku broth with smaller pieces of sliced meat rather than chunks of meat. Honestly this reminded me more of Chinese braised noodles. The udon here was also skinnier/flatter. Marugame has the rounder thicker noodles that are smooth and buttery which I prefer.

I'm weird and prefer soba noodles and I always compare any Japanese noodles that aren't ramen to my favorite Japantown restaurant in San Francisco (Mifune).

When we arrived, we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. It ended up being an hour and a half wait, which was not ideal but the food did arrive quickly once we were seated. I ordered something new for me, the kamaage, which is noodles with a dipping sauce. The sauce was delicious and the noodles were great - chewy but not overcooked. I also got a side of shrimp tempura which was cooked perfectly. My friends got the sansai and the niku, and both were very pleased with their orders.

The vegetable tempura was good but a little bland and one of two of the vegetables were so hard to chew and break down. Otherwise the meal was great. My only gripe is how tight the restaurant is. The seats are so close to one another to the point where your sitting 1 feet away from random people. Also it was super hot in the restaurant to the point of sweating. I highly recommend the spot for the food but not for the dining experience. Also they only accept cash which can be problematic if you go there and forget to get cash.

My only note is that we paid extra for the chili oil and I genuinely did not taste it at all -- so avoid ordering that and save yourself the charge if you want spicy!

Tina A.,/user_details?userid=UIzCwb08Cyy8sPdaoJo-Vg,"Montville, NJ",1/4/2020,4.0,"I ordered the chikara which has chicken and blocks of mochi on the bottom that you're supposed to break into cubes. I'm not sure if the mochi really fits with the dish, but it was interesting to try. I think there was too much of it though because it definitely fills you up. I'm used to lighter udon broths so this one was kinda salty to me, but the actual udon noodles were really good. Just the right amount of chewy! Although the wait was long to get a table and to get our food, service was great in terms of never having an empty glass of water. We came with a party of 9 and were eventually able to sit altogether.

We had went Pre-COVID and the seating inside was super limited. But it was a real nice experience. Their udon noodle was super flavorful. I am not sure what it is about the broth but it had complimented the udon very well. I am a texture type of gal and I loved how chewy the udon was. Every bite was mesmerizing and you can bet that I had dipped every drop of that broth.

The chicken was extremely juicy and fried well but I was not a big fan of the sauce, which seemed like a vinegar based, mild, chipotle mayo. The pieces were fairly large and a small was definately enough for 2. For mains, we ordered the spicy niku and curry with washuyu beef. We added a poached egg and shiitake mushroom to each, and also mochi to the curry udon. The noodles came in a massive bowl, and had a decent amount of toppings. I absolutely loved the spicy niku broth, which had a lot of flavor but didn't feel too heavy. My girlfriend liked the curry broth, though I felt it was a little watery. The short ribs were tender and the honeycomb tripe added a unique texture to the dish. Both eggs were perfectly poached. The shiitake was also delicious - it's marinated/preserved in some type of sweet soy sauce and has a very firm texture - but we were a bit surprised we only received one piece each. All in, I'd be happy to return and order the Spicy Niku again with the same add-ons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

So naturally there is a myriad of options for Ramen and Noodles in the city because everyone wants a piece of the pie but Raku is a diamond in the rough. It may not be as well known and high-fi as the other big ones like Ippudo and Momofuku but its homey, authentic and delicious.

Maybe I knew what to expect, or maybe I'm losing my taste buds (I should probably get covid tested) but this soup was only okay. The noodle texture and tripe were pretty good, and the pieces of beef were THICK so the chef really hooked me up with that one, but it didn't blow my mind the same way it did the first time. This venue was also much smaller and dimmer and not as delicately decorated, so if you have the chance please go to the other one for a better overall dining experience. This place was also cash only but they have this ATM machine in the back that you could use to withdraw cash. Though, I must say, the young and fun staff was definitely a plus, and they were really efficient despite nearly spilling the Niku on my friend when setting the bowl down on the table.

I spent an afternoon in manhattan and decided to treat myself to a solitary, contemplative early dinner. Raku fit the bill exceptionally well. The workers were kind and attentive, and the food came out quickly. The ohitashi shamed my at-home wilted spinach, as it was much more flavorful and softer on the pallet than I'd previously experienced.

Callie S.,/user_details?userid=6vCVkHhqg802f4juBhRfZA,"Los Angeles, CA",6/2/2019,5.0,Definitely the best udon place in the city. The wait will be long on the weekend so plan accordingly. Get the short ribs udon or the gyunan udon (this one is with sliced shabu beef). Get the agedashi tofu for appetizers because it's the best I've had in the city. The fried chicken was just ok for me but I think it could be good for a group of people to enjoy some chicken and beers! They only serve bottled beers and sakes and no draft beers. Super small but great for udon.

Dawn Y.,/user_details?userid=_FdfOgGT846PJzasFJ0F2Q,"Kaneohe, HI",1/7/2020,2.0,"This is near the university so there were a fair number of students there, surprising because it was rather expensive. I had the cold udon with wasabi. It's a tiny hole in the wall so that is a plus for the atmosphere, but you don't feel the coziness of a hole in the wall 'good' place to hang out in. It feels cavelike in a cold anonymous way. The neutrals don't give it a sophisticated air, more like a sad underground train station kiosk.  There was a rowdy group of guys next to us...too much sake,they were very loud, but the waitress didn't seem to know how to handle them, because in the confined space of the restaurant, they were clearly annoying other guests than just us.  One knocked over a drink, the other gesticulating so wildly he swatted my friend and nearly knocked dishes from the hands of the waitress passing him a few time. And all thru the meal they were loud and vulgar, guy nearest us tossed his jacket on hitting my friend in the head. I took a star off because the space is very small which means atmosphere counts ALOT, and boorish guests make or break the experience. The waitress or owner should be able to control the space, like any respectable local pub in Japan, they maintain control over the guests as well as the food. I think the udon would have been ok, but I could hardly taste it. Compared to my experience with a udon hole in the wall in Osaka, this is definitely not as tasty, classy or pleasant.  Given the neighborhood having soo much to choose from, I would not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was kind of hard to find the restaurant but we saw some pictures on yelp and that helped us find the front of the restaurant. It's literally a hole in the wall and there's only around 7 tables inside. We went right when they opened so it wasn't packed but slowly people started arriving as we ordered. Server was really friendly and the udon was AMAZING. I got the wakame udon, niku, and the katsu-don. I liked the wakame udon the best. It tasted really fresh and the noodles were chewy as well. The niku was a bit heavy for me but it was still really good. The Katsu-don was great! It comes with a pickled vegetable that goes well with the bowl.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kieun L.,/user_details?userid=zSYcE0me-U__8KVuqE3-kw,"Manhattan, NY",9/6/2018,5.0,"I've heard about raku for a long time and I always wondered ""udon is good but how good can it be?"" And then I finally tried it. I'm just thankful I don't live near the place because I would probably eat there everyday. The noodle is what really sets Raku apart from other udon places that I've tried. It's chewy - still soft, but has more depth to it when you chew. The broth / flavor is also great (I've tried the niku, duck breast, and jaja udon) - clean, all the ingredients compliment each other very well. I could go on and on about how amazing this place is but you won't really know until you go and check it out yourself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It doesn't seem like the waitress there have a section to serve people bc another one came up to us to asked if we wanted to order anything to drink after we placed an order 1 minute ago. As for starter, we got the chicken tatasu. It was so crispy outside and juicy outside. It's a must get when you come here if you like chicken. For the udon, i got the niku udon. The broth was delicious and the noodle was so bouncy. My bf got the ebiten udon. He really like the fried shrimp and eggplant. I would come back here for the udon since it's freshly made.

The soup taste was just ok to me nothing special. The eels and egg rice is mostly rice with a thin layer of egg and few pieces of bony eel. The fried chicken is good but not as flavorful as the other reviews stated. The gyoza skin is good but the pork inside isn't very tasty. The press mackerel is good as well but nothing special.

I want to order the fried chicken next time or try the katsudon.  We got in with no problem at 4:00 pm but the place only has about 20 seats so there's potential to have a wait.  Unlike ramen which tends to overdo the ingredients, the udon is cleaner and the broth is lighter.  It is cash only but there is an ATM inside if needed.

Andrea L.,/user_details?userid=hSodx72JLu4qczjTnhNPRw,"Manhattan, NY",11/12/2019,2.0,"I'm not sure how I feel about this place honestly. I was excited to try this place due to the great reviews and I liked it but I didn't love it. I ordered the karage and pork gyoza to start. The karage was my favorite part of the meal but the pork gyoza was mediocre at best. My friends got the curry wagyu udon and I got the Niku udon since it was recommended and seemed very popular. The udon was very clean tasting and definitely what I would want if I was feeling under the weather. The udon was good; it was very silky and slipped right out of my chopsticks. Overall, it was good but didn't hit the spot like I had expected. My friends were thoroughly unimpressed by the curry udon. The wagyu beef was very dry and tasted kind of like hot pot beef and the broth was a little bit on the blander side and didn't have that curry kick they were looking for. Other than the food, my experience wasn't that greatest. The hostess was EXTREMELY rude to us. My friends got their first and put down their names before I had arrived. I mistakenly put down my name as well unknowingly and the hostess stormed out of the restaurant with the worst attitude asking us if we were the same group and then proceeded to scold us and tell us that she would now have to delete one of the reservations. It was a simple mistake and she could've told us nicely. When we entered, our server was nice so I don't want to say that the overall service was bad.  The place only accepts cash so if you do go, make sure to bring some cash.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kim X.,/user_details?userid=yVS0746EB5gBNGE8FG5p-w,"New York, NY",3/31/2018,4.0,"This place was literally a hidden gem! You could very easily walk by the white exterior with mackerel skin curtains that hide the entrance to this small and simply designed udon noodle heaven. We were told the wait was going to be an hour for two, but received a text that the table was ready in less than 45 min! I was not surprised that we had to wait. It says more abt the size of the restaurant than the popularity as it could probably only fit about 25 patrons. We split the fried chicken, which was deliciously fried. I've had better and made better spicy mayo sauce though. Good thing the chicken was tasty enough without the mayo. We both got the niku udon with the tripe and beef. I've never had such silky fresh udon noodles before! Definitely worth eating in as many different broths and sides as possible. The meat was also very juicy and tender! The broth was flavorful and not too salty! The place would've definitely gotten 5 stars if not for the wait and the noodle bowls being 17 dollars a bowl, not including tax.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We felt like the gyunan udon was similar to the niku udon but with a weaker broth",https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The simple, discolored wooden signage on white washed wall is easy to miss. Cash only. Their udon noodles are flatter & chewier than normal ones. Serving size is good. We started with chicken karaage. Curry with beef came in thick and hot soup. The Niku (short rib), Ebiten (shrimp tempura), Kitzune (bean curd) were nicely done with tasty broth. Both cold noodles we tried Ja Ja (spicy miso) and Yamakake (yam with small quail egg) were very good.

I had the niku udon and my friend had the duck udon. The udon noodles are amazing and they taste handmade and very fresh. None of that processed udon that you get at other restaurants. The noodles were a bit thinner but very chewy and perfectly al dente. The short ribs and beef tripe in my noodle soup was so flavorful and just melt in your mouth. The soup was full of beef flavor but still very light. My friend also loved her duck udon but said the duck meat was a bit overcooked.

The hostess took down my name and number and informed me that it'll be around a half hour wait and that I will receive a text when the table is ready. The wait was less than half an hour and the texting system gave us freedom to walk around during the wait time. My boyfriend got their popular Niku Udon (Beef tripe), the broth was so flavorful and the beef was tender and melts in your mouth. I got the Ankake Udon with a side of tempura, the Ankake broth was this thick, egg broth with a few vegetables. The flavor was way lighter than the Niku, very simple and not much special. The Udon though was so chewy and soft and it seemed as if there was an endless amount in the bowl!!

The fried chicken appetizer was also good with not a lot of fat - the dip was slightly spicy for me but seemed like it was only a spicy mayo combination. The atmosphere is tight but cute. I would say that the only two downfalls are that the soup comes out unbearably hot and takes a long time to cool down, that I left with a seared mouth that took a day to recoup.

It was just some shredded green pepper, onion and something else. It was definitely not worth it. I also had the bacon, it was disappointing. It was more like smoked ham than bacon.

Leslie T.,/user_details?userid=1msVg_B-Ef6K814sQDOTPA,"New York, NY",2/28/2018,4.0,"Having gone to Japan two months ago, I've really been craving some good Udon. After scouring the internet looking and hoping for another euphoric bowl of Udon - I'm glad to have come across Raku. What makes or breaks a good bowl of noodles is the texture, in my opinion. Raku's Udon was slimy and not as chewy as I wanted, but it was still pretty dang good. My friend got the shrimp tempura udon - after claiming he wouldn't order anything since he was ""full"" - but upon walking in, he knew that he couldn't pass up this opportunity for some authentic Japanese Udon. I got the simple egg udon which was exactly what I wanted. The broth was a little saltier than I'd like and a little too simple for my taste, but the egg and the vegetables made it worth it. Also, it was a little chilly outside and nothing makes you feel better than a hot bowl of noodle soup on a chilly New York day. Pretty easy to find, we got there right at 11:30 on a Saturday and snagged the last table of 2. Other people after us got seats at the bar and the wait quickly became 30-40 minutes after we seated (we were super lucky!). Come hungry, leave satisfied.

We ordered the small chicken tatsuta-age - it was very delicious with the spicy mayo sauce. I got the Niku hot udon (short rib and tripe) - everything about it was perfect.

Mai L.,/user_details?userid=Sxq23xvpMDhyWx1WG7pHkQ,"New York, NY",1/2/2016,5.0,Simple and good food. Excellent place if you are looking for good Udon and some small plates to nosh on with the delicious chewy noodles. My favorite so far is the seaweed udon and the plain udon with dipping sauce. The chicken udon had a good broth but the mochi was not exactly what I expected. The shrimp tempura udon was good but the broth needed a little extra kick to it which was easily fixed with the spicy sesame seasoning that they had on the table. Looking forward to the next visit where I plan to try the gyoza which seem to be a pretty popular appetizer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/raku-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The bowl contained noodles, spinach, scallions, egg and ginger, apart from the broth. The broth was clear but really thick - gel-like. The noodles were chewy.

Jennifer T.,/user_details?userid=zYLIJ83hvdSnHQSIFX-oQA,"Queens, NY",4/5/2016,5.0,"Best udon I've had in the city! It's an extremely small place but once you go inside you feel as though you've been transported into a real noodle shop in Japan. It has a real simple and Zen feel to it. Anyway, I ordered the Ebiten Udon (Shrimp Tempura) and when it came out I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were two lightly fried pieces of shrimp and a slice of eggplant tempura sitting on a plate above a deep bowl of steaming hot udon. Usually the shrimp is already in the broth and then it gets all soggy by the time it reaches your table, so I enjoyed the fact they separated them and the way it was presented overall. Anyway, the broth itself is really light yet deep in flavor and honestly the favorite part for me was the chewy noodles. The noodles were thick but look and tasted freshly made and hand cut. It was just the perfect texture and comes with a nice amount of spinach. I thought that it wouldn't be filling (I have a big appetite), but that bowl is deeper than you might imagine and there was a good hefty amount of noodles. You basically won't leave there stinkin' full, but you won't be hungry either. Anyway, I would definitely come back to try more!

The lighting is warm and it complements the wooden tables well. The bathroom is even pretty cool as it has a sliding door and is well kept. As per other yelp reviews,  I tried the Niku Udon option and I definitely was not disappointed. Coming in a large black bowl, the soup fills it about 3/5 of the way. The broth has a very pleasant, savory smell that is very enticing. The udon noodles are chewy in a good way and not too soft at all. It absorbed the flavoring of the broth very well too although I would say the broth by itself is a tad too salty. The beef is still mildly red on inside and it tears easily apart with each bite. The beef tripe is very tender as well. Overall, it was a enjoyable environment and the food was quite excellent.

The inside is also small so it's not great for parties larger than 4. I came with a friend later in the afternoon so we were seated right away. We decided to share chicken tatsuka-age and a gyunan udon with a poached egg and extra udon noodles. The chicken was juicy and served with a spicy mayo sauce. I wish they had given us more mayo as it was gone after the first two pieces of chicken. The udon was very good. The noodles had a nice chew and you could definitely tell that they were freshly made. Also, the bowl of udon is huge. You can't tell through the pictures on Yelp, but it is big. While this place can run pretty steep for just a bowl of udon, a hack would be to share a bowl with a friend and order extra noodles or even toppings to stretch your dollar.

Then, another couple came after us, deliberated whether they should eat here and then finally went in to wait. Then, a group of four came and one of them went in to ask the wait situation. They were given a table immediately bc a table of four just left. However, the tables are by couple so the restaurant could have totally split the tables and sat us and the couple after us. Instead, they chose to sit the four that came after all of us. A few more minutes later, they sit the couple that came after us. That was the last straw and we left.

I've had it several times around the US and even in Japan, and I must say it's one of the best I've ever tried. It was easy to tell that the ankimo was prepped by a professional. The seasonings on it were just the right consistency, and the presentation was 5-star worthy. The only bad thing I noticed was the crowd - the tables here are very close to each other, and it got so crowded soon after we sat down to the point where we didn't really have any privacy. I could notice that the people on the table next to us could listen to our conversation without even trying, and we we're speaking in a pretty quiet tone. I would probably come back here, but not after 5pm because judging from my first visit, that's when guests start pouring in.

I was still thinking about it two days later.  I would recommend this spot for the pizza not the burger and the drinks were weak in my opinion.  I get tipsy with a glass of wine or sangria and decided to have a ""Patio Pounder"" mixed drink since it was my husband birthday and I left without the slightest buzz.  My husband had ""The Fenton New York Giants Punch"" and also felt it was weak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/emily-west-village-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jessica S.,/user_details?userid=XZaCs-Gs0SXdZgfG38GFYw,"San Diego, CA",9/21/2022,5.0,"Everyone's favorite pizza place which has a much raved about burger, the Emmy Double Stack Burger. Said burger contains two juicy dry-aged beef patties, the famed EMMY sauce, caramelized onion, & American cheese, all on a pretzel bun. The burger was truly immaculate. Upon first bite, the famed EMMY sauce just comes dripping out, interlacing with the juices of the medium rare beef, the cheese ooey gooey like molasses. Much thought was placed into all ingredients because even the pretzel bun, teasing with its sheen, did an excellent job in general upkeep of all contents. My slight gripe would be that our burger was more the size of a slider and came with waffle fries instead of curly fries. But, we had even ordered a Chicken Parm sandwich which contained the crunchiest breaded chicken imaginable. Both food items were sensational! It is a place that is much raved about for a reason. We took a chance with a walk-in on a weekday around 2:30pm and were seated immediately. Such sweet luck for one one sweet meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/emily-west-village-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The burger was unreal and so full of flavor. I added bacon to mine which I believe complemented the burger pretty well and having a side of Emmy sauce was great. The sauce itself is amazing and was used for the fries too. Colony pizza is an interesting pizza with a good balance between sweet and spicy from the honey and peppers. It's a thicker piece of pizza which I feel is usually a hit or miss as it could be too doughy but thought this one was great.

Michael P.,/user_details?userid=jpdXxCZrebM1oqQsstXN7Q,"San Diego, CA",7/18/2021,5.0,"On a quiet, tree-lined street in the West Village is one of the preeminent dining establishments in New York City--Emily! Upon approaching, the exterior of the restaurant is chic--beautiful greenery and magnificent lights--set the expectations for a memorable dining experience. Entering into the restaurant, the interior is contemporary with modern decor, inclusive of subway wall tiling and interior plants. If you are coming on a weekend, be sure to come early to ensure you can get a table and confirm item availability. As a very nice gesture, particularly in the time of Covid, all tables are set with individual hand sanitizer dispensers. Water crafts on the table also help to ensure efficient service. Now, on to the main event, the food. No hyperbole, this is some of the very best fare I've had at any restaurant in the United States! A staple of this restaurant is the Emily. This burger is served on a pretzel roll and includes a special sauce, sweet onion and pickle on the side. The combination of the special sauce and sweet onion flavor creates for an especially sensory experience that delights completely. The beef patty is extremely tender, seemingly to crumble into individual morsels of deliciousness with every bite. The amalgamation of flavors and textures makes this a burger worthy of a visit by itself, but then there's the pizza. Again, one of the very best pizzas I've had. The pizza here is Detroit style--rectangular in shape with carmelized crust. I ordered the MVP with olives. The crust has a hint of garlic and other seasonings and the carmelization really sets the foundation for an exceptional pizza. The sauce has a robust flavor and is in abundance on the pizza. In the case of the MVP, the pesto sauce is an exceptional counterpart to the tomato sauce and adds a brilliant infusion of flavor. Finally the cheese and toppings are fresh and delicious. Emily will surely be on our list of places to introduce any visitors to New York. Simply exceptional.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/emily-west-village-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Pies were too doughy and not fully cooked even though they took forever. There were about 20 minute gaps between pies coming out and the toppings were completely uneven. For $26 a pie, all pieces should be as even as possible. They were out of many things and one staff member had to get Diet Coke liters from a grocery store nearby but first She stopped to smoke right next to our table outside! She was also hanging out of her shirt and cursing like a sailor while on her phone, complaining, which seemed inappropriate. Service left a lot to be desired with many staff members being very snippy and making smart remarks in Spanish amongst themselves within earshot of patio patrons.

That and one pizza was fine for 2 people, with some extra. Came as a walk-in around 6pm on a weekday and got a table right away, although they only had a table inside. It was pretty hot, no AC, just an individual fan at the table. And service was a bit slow.

I ordered take out since my husband wanted to try some and it was raining. I ordered the Colony and the Tina to go. It took about 15-20 minutes for them to make it. As soon as they handed me the box I could immediately smell the aroma, it smelled so good that as I was walking back to the train in the rain I had to stop and take a bite of one. And omg it tasted just as good as it smelled and I had two slices one hot and one cold and they both were tasty.

I decided to try the pizza this time and it was okay but not the best. Sorta tasted like bougie a  Pizza Hut pizza where they rubbed some honey on the bottom. The main reason I'm taking off stars is because I placed a pickup order, they said it would be an hour wait, I don't live in the neighborhood so I figured I'd just walk around for an hour till my food was ready.

Joshua C.,/user_details?userid=hkehsSHUtf9oVQc-TpcvhA,"Brooklyn, NY",3/3/2021,4.0,"I am a pizza lover and take my pizza very seriously. The ambiance of this location was great. I ordered the Mimi and the Colony. The Colony was a recommendation of the waiter, and it was great. I accompanied the pizza with a 2016 Malbec, La Posta. The service was good, I went on a Friday night, it was busy and I think the service could have been a bit faster on the response time. The food did come out in a timely fashion, being asked for our initial drinks did take about 8 to 10 minutes to happen. I wasn't too happy about that but it wasn't a deal breaker considering how busy It was, I think it was fair. I did chose to eat at the bar, this wasn't bad at all. Seating area at the bar wasn't a ton of room but it wasn't too tight either, I am 5'11 and 196lbs (200lbs after the meal :)) I chose to eat at the bar rather than wait 1+ hr for a table. Pricing was fair and justified the quality of the food and This was easily one of my top 5 pizza experiences.

I recommend making reservations ahead of time so you can be seated upstairs where the ambiance is nicer. The Emzie was our favorite! The Detroit style pizza with tomatillo sauce, mozzarella cheese, olives, onions and cherry peppers. If you get the classic pie I recommend the Sichuan oil with it. It gives it a kick. For appetizer, we shared Crowley's, curly fries with condiments. I asked for hot sauce on the side as I like things extra flavorful.

Some of the pizzas are a bit pricey like the pig freaker, but it was super heavy and tasty so it's good for sharing. Warning: it is quite salty. The burger tasted great but patties are always cooked medium and it's two thin patties vs one thick patty which I prefer cooked pink in the middle. Their version of medium has no pink, but not surprised because the patties are thin. Tasted great but also really heavy. Curly fries were okay, was a bit on the salty side and even so, tasted a bit under seasoned. It needed something else, curly fries usually have a bit of seasoning other than just salt. Staff is super friendly.

Keeley H.,/user_details?userid=Pyqo52obWlPmffd67GzQtQ,"Los Angeles, CA",1/18/2020,4.0,Cute spot. Was super busy but I was able to get a seat at the bar as I was there solo on a work trip. It took a really long time for the pizza to come out hence the 4 stars but it was good - spicier than  expected (I don't think jalapeños are mentioned in the description) but the crust was really fluffy and the vodka sauce and pepperoni didn't disappoint. Bartender made me a hot toddy that wasn't on the menu so that was a plus. I'd definitely go back to try the Emmy Burger as I saw that come out and I almost wished I had gotten that instead!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/emily-west-village-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My husband enjoys the burger - I'm just down for the colony pizza - the jalapeño and honey is a really lovely combo.

Shell K.,/user_details?userid=5J_R9Kb2an_33MKU2vOWbw,"Houston, TX",12/7/2019,3.0,The Emmy burger was very overrated. I think it was the sauce that threw me off. I think it's really about preference.

They put American cheese on the burger in West Village and Cheddar in Brooklyn. I don't know what your feelings are on American cheese but I'm okay with it on a $3 burger but a $26 burger better have the best damn cheese around!

Ade B.,/user_details?userid=iJE3RnVcfHM3jsM4I6WFCw,"Philadelphia, PA",2/24/2019,5.0,"I visited this hidden gem in NYC because I heard their burger was one of the best. NYC restaurants generally disappoint me when my expectations are too high, so I tried to keep my expectations low when I ordered the Emily Burger. They also serve ""Detroit style"" pizza, and looking around the restaurant I saw what looked to be delicious pan pizzas similar to what you would find in Chicago. My friend ordered a pizza. As soon as the Emily burger arrived and I sliced it, I couldn't contain my excitement any longer. It was 2 juicy patties perfectly cooked with cheese in between and special sauce dripping down. I could see it would be a messy but delicious burger just from looking at it. Then when I bit into it I was in burger heaven. In the top 3 of burgers I've ever tasted, and I've had lots of burgers around the country. The pretzel bun was so much better than expected, as it sopped up whatever juices weren't running down my hand as I ate it. Best burger I've had in NYC for sure. Then I tried a slice of pizza. It was heavenly too! Much better than NY style pizza most of NYC loves so much. If that's Detroit style, now I know I have to get pizza if I ever find myself in Detroit. An added bonus was that they serve Coke in the bottle! Coke is always best in the bottle.

We went around lunchtime on a Saturday and it was very crowded when we walked in, but we were able to be seated relatively quickly. They had fun drinks on the menu and we both had a different one. We also ordered two different pizzas to try to give us a variety. We ordered a regular one and a fun one. They were both delicious. It was a crunchy crust, and a soft middle, but a great balance.

The wait for a table was too long when we were in the area (1.5 hours -  this is December during covid times and outdoor dining only) so we decided to get takeout and ordered the Emmy burger and the spicy chicken sandwich. When we got home, both sandwiches proved to be extremely messy to eat because of the sauces. Deconstruction aside, both were very tasty - but the sauces wayyy overpowered. Also, they did not ask how I wanted my burger when I placed the order and I was surprised to see that it was rather undercooked. Not sure if this is considered a modification?- which the menu notes they decline - if so they should note that the chef recommendation is rare to medium rare. I was also disappointed by the fries - I love curly fries, but got maybe 4 in my order, and the rest were bottom of the barrel, extra crispy end pieces.

For example, At Emily BK, the Colony has pepperoni, jalapeños and honey on a thin crust pizza, but the Colony in WV is a Detroit style pizza. I prefer the Detroit style over the thin crust, but I know some are die hard thin crust fans. Detroit style is very similar to Sicilian pizza. We also had a chance to get the Emily burger which was so so good. The Detroit style pizza was pretty bomb. I can't say there were any part of that slice that I dislike. It had everything I loved on a pizza. Pepperoni for the salty meat I needed, honey for the touch of sweetness and the chili to give it a little kick. There's a possibility that it tasted extra good because we were pretty tipsy before we got there.

Allie ..,/user_details?userid=_r-8yxB_ZnEsxRH2qUwH0Q,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/14/2019,4.0,"Came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed full. Definitely a very popular spot! After reading all the rave reviews of the burger, I finally had to break down and try it. We ended up ordering the Emily pizza and a burger. Going into this place, I was less excited about the pizza because I prefer thin crust over a thicker crust. I was pleasantly surprised by the pizza and really enjoyed it!! Would definitely come back here just for pizza. As for the burger, it was excellent as well and extremely flavorful. My only complaint is that it's a bit overpriced for what it is. You can't charge $26 for a burger that's served on a metal try with a sheet of paper. If you're going to charge so much, make the presentation a little but nicer. The burger also comes with curly fries and they taste similar to Arby's curly fries, which is never a bad thing! Another thing that kind of rubbed us the wrong way was the fact they bring out food ""as it's made."" They brought my boyfriends pizza out first. We waited for five minutes and then I made him go ahead and start eating because his pizza was going to get cold. My burger didn't come out until he was almost done with his pizza. So many restaurants figure out how to bring the whole tables food out at the same time so you aren't awkwardly waiting to eat. I don't understand why Emily can't do the same. Overall, will definitely come back despite the burger being a bit overpriced and the food not coming out at the same time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/emily-west-village-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The restaurant appears to be small, but there's actually a whole bottom floor where the kitchen, restrooms, and group seating are all located. In true New York style, all the tables are absolutely on top of each other. The servers are nice but usually running up and down the stairs and therefore not that present.

I went with my 7 year old son on a Monday night and despite the hostess having a look of why would you come here with a kid look the server was very pleasant. We shared the meatballs to start. They were very good and flavorful. To the burger which many have raved as the best burger in nyc and beyond. This was by far the most overrated burger I've ever eaten. They only cook it in two temps, medium and well. Why would I ever want a dry aged meat medium or well? You couldn't even taste the meat. The sauce was good but very overpowering.

It took almost an hour for our food to come. We ordered the Emily pizza and the Emily burger. We had to prompt the server to provide an update on when our food would come out. By the time the burger arrived it was lukewarm and looked like it had been sitting there for a long time. I'm sure it would have been great when hot but the way it was served to us I would not order it again. The Emily pizza also did not seem like it had just come out of the oven but it was much better than the burger. The truffle and honey was delicious and the pistachios provided a nice crunch. Overall experience was much worse than I had expected.

Me and my cousin split an Emmy burger and pizza, the pizza was extremely solid, the pepperoni was crisped up perfectly and was an overall extremely good full bite to it. The Emmy burger on the other hand was truly phenomenal, each bite was just overwhelming with flavor, I had to take breaks to regain my composure and remind myself I was in a restaurant and shouldn't be having a romantic moment with this sandwich. The pretzel bun was toasted perfectly, the dry aged beef was juicey and melted in your mouth. I felt as if I was get lost in the sauce in only the best way.

Zachary A.,/user_details?userid=JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Austin, TX",12/14/2019,4.0,"Good meal that left me full and content. Known for the burgers and pizza, we had one of each and a cocktail and beer. All in bit less than $80. No reservation but came and put number down and got a text about 40 minutes later for a 9:30pm dinner on a Thursday - yes it is that crazy even then. Had the pizza with pepperoni, jalapeño, and hot honey. Charred crust and a bit over cooked for my liking. But pepperoni were very good. Honey was unnoticed and cut into six pieces so perfect to share. Not as thick as I expected so reminded me of a Roman slice of traditional pizza but a bit more cooked. Burger was solid. No substitutions or changes so it comes as is - drenched in sauce and onions. Two patty and medium means medium rare here which in my mind is good, but beware. Burger patties really good and juicy, but the sauce and heaps of grilled onions really overpower the burger. Pretzel bun an interesting addition, but again not sure it really helps enhance the burger flavor and more. Lots of big flavors in the burger that might not work together in my opinion. Curly fries a cute side that isn't typical and gives the dish some more uniqueness. Beer list small at 4 and $10. Cocktails $15 and seemed to lean sweet. Enjoyed my meal here, but tough to get a spot. Interesting options to spice up a traditional burger or pizza like sichuan oil or Fried chicken on top of a pie.

The place was jammed and the waitstaff was buzzing about--attentive and totally pro at their jobs. We started with shared plates: a couple of Emily WV's amazing burgers, and a Brussel sprout salad--delish! Then we ordered four pies: 2 round, the Emily (truffle sottocenere, pistachios and honey) was super flavorful! and a Classic (red sauce and cheese), which was pretty close to a perfect pie; and 2 8x10s: a red, the Colony (pepperoni, pickled chili and honey) and a pink, the Vodka. The 8x10s were thick, pan pizzas highlighted by a tasty crust. Both were exceptional. The pies were plentiful and we had a few slices to take home. Emily WV had a nice selection of (mostly) local craft beer both on tap and in cans. I had a lovely Florette saison from the Long Island City brewery.

Well.... I Contemplated 3 stars ....It's not the food or the setting - it was the lack of a warm reception as we entered and were seated by the hostess  which carried over into our server.  With such a great setting a server should do more than just take your order, deliver your food, clear away your plates and deliver your check.  How about a warm hello with a smile, some light conversation and advice about the menu, and thanks for coming and hope you enjoyed dining with us today?!  BTW the Emmy burger and curly fries were fantastic!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/emily-west-village-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I came very early on a Friday (around 5:15) and had no trouble getting a table. We got the pizza (with vodka sauce) and a burger - both were good but very heavy. Nothing I would run back for.

At 5:30pm the hostess said they would be able to seat us as walk ins. Thirty minutes later they brought us downstairs to the basement which wreaked of mildew and actually had rain sleeping through the brick walls and a small fan on the floor to blow around the misty air!!! I saw two guests before us complain and get seated upstairs instead. But when we asked the hostess was polite and honestly was trying to help but the manager was rude and said we would not be able to sit at all no matter how long we waited unless we took the bar or sat in the mildewing basement (which should have honestly be been closed due to the leak and terrible smell) it was comical to expect anyone sit down there. The 5 seat bar was overcrowded with people with reservations that were made to wait even though the top floor was half empty !

The burger which is a Pat Lafrieda blended burger with sauteed onions , emmy sauce?, american cheese on a pretzel bun. It was a great tasting burger, Lafrieda blends usually are, but it was undercooked which is a big possibility with a double thick patty. They never asked how i wanted cooked. Good thing i like it this way. Likevi said , it was good, just not $26 good. You can get 5 pat lafrieda burgers at shake shack for that money. It did come with some fresh seasoned curly fries still not worth $26, I'd go $20 it is Manhattan. We never had Detroit style pizza before, so we ordered the Mimi. First off, it was freakin good pizza. Crunchy square crust doughy interior with nice sweet red sauce ,  and cheese. The mimi was supposed to have ricotta,  sauteed garlic , mushrooms and basil. I only saw and tasted the latter two. All in all i would recommend this place for the pizza, and the burger if money is not an option.

Anyhow, upon requesting a table of 4, the servers exchanged a reluctant look as if they did not want us there. However, we did not think of it much then and waited for them to seat us. They then checked to ask if we had reservations, which was a little surprising since they weren't very busy. We told them, we did not and they exchanged another round of reluctant looks. After a few minutes, just as they are about to get us seated they inform us that they only serve the burgers for people who have reservations. Now, this totally blew my mind. Nowhere had they mentioned such a thing nor had I come across such a unique rule.

Neeta D.,/user_details?userid=s--oYE0mLYY_WqgtNBREpg,"New York, NY",11/30/2018,3.0,"We came to this location of Emily primarily because I was dying to try those Detroit square pies that were not available in the Brooklyn location. The way this restaurant is set up is interesting; you almost feel like you're dining in someone's wine cellar (if seated in the basement) and it doesn't seem particularly cramped even when full. We ordered the Colony, subbing in olives for pepperoni, and the cacio e pepe round pie. The Colony pie was BEAUTIFUL, with very robust sauce, the perfect amount of cheese that was deeply caramelized at the edges, and wonderfully paired toppings (jalapeno and honey is a winner, imo). The cacio e pepe is where things fell apart a little. It was actually a little revolting how much cheese was on it (and I say this as a cheese lover), and the crust was super thin, with no sauce to balance it out. Unfortunately, the cheese was leaking grease and had reached a rubbery consistency by the time it reached the table. I choked down a slice, but felt sick for the rest of the night because of it (and so did my dining buddy, somehow). I'd stick to the fresher square pies, y'all. Those are truly worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/emily-west-village-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Jay P.,/user_details?userid=5jh14_0BlRSibvIonbpzzQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9/6/2017,1.0,"My wife and I ate here a couple months back and it was amazing.  We had the Emmy burger and pizza and the food was absolutely superb, probably the best burger I have ever had.  So i decided after work to head down to their place and order some food to go and surprise my wife when I got home.  I ask when I get there if they do take out and the waitress assured me they did but when I asked for two Emmy burgers to go the individual behind the bar informs me that they dont allow the burger to be served for take out.  So, I ask him if they can just simply put the burgers in a bag for me and be on my way.  The guy immediately gets nasty and just repeats what he originally said, ""we dont allow the burger to be served for take out"".  Now im pissed.  I traveled 40 min out of my way to go to this place and for some stupid reason they wont allow a burger to be sold for take out on top if the nasty attitude I received for asking a logical question.  The staff's nasty attitude along with the establishments inability to simply adjust to the customer's needs (serving a friggin burger to go) guarantees that, not only will I never eat here again, I will make sure everyone I know, knows about this ridiculous interaction with those who run Emily.  Call me crazy but I find it ludicrous that a restaurant would turn down $60 because they dont want to serve a burger to go.  If anything they would increase their profit margins if they served the burger to go considering you wouldnt take up any of their restaurant space and the burger is one of the higher priced items on the menu.  But, hey, maybe they didnt want me reverse engineering their special sauce in my garage at home.  Who knows.  Anyway, I digress.  Thanks, Emily, for not making any sense",https://www.yelp.com/biz/emily-west-village-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The food was good, Crowley fries are a must. We ordered two pizzas, they were good. However, I would not wait again two hours for that pizza. The ambiance, too loud, crowded, small, but I guess that's NY. I felt rushed all the time. Before we even finished our drinks  the check was ""thrown"" on our table. What if we wanted something else??? Apparently that is not the vibe there. Laid back is not their thing. Go in, eat, get out. I get it, it was peak rush our.

Ravin A.,/user_details?userid=GTUecO3q8qkMDp0PdIONLw,"Jersey City, NJ",12/21/2017,1.0,"I decided to go to dinner at Pizza Loves Emily with my siblings and my girlfriend. On the phone, I was told the wait would be about 10-15 minutes. Once we get there, I was quoted 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours. Regardless, we decided to wait and put my name and number down. Since we were anticipating the wait, we began to walk around. 20 minutes later, we get a text saying our table was ready and we have only 10 minutes to get there. We were forced to take an Uber so we can get our table. Once we arrived and were seated, our waiter came over and told us that we can't get the Detroit Pizza (8x10) as they don't have the dough anymore for the night and that this has never happened before. We were disappointed but understood so we just ordered the normal 12"" circle pizza. Once we got our drinks and curly fries, we noticed that people who came after us and ordered pizza began to get their orders and it happened to be the 8x10 Detroit Pizza. We assumed they may have ordered it ahead of time so we didn't make anything of it. Towards the end of our dinner, we noticed that more and more customers began to get the pizza that we were told is not available for the night. All of a sudden they had it available. Did they receive a ""special delivery"" at 9:00 pm on a Thursday night? I doubt it. The waiter didn't even bother to mention they had it available again. If they didn't want to serve us, they could have told us and we would have left. Thanks for nothing.

Gardea C.,/user_details?userid=oSSmir4HXFU9chAkyuq0Nw,"New York, NY",4/1/2020,3.0,Foods are good. I got delivery. Steak was not the best tasting but did the job. The salad and rice were great sides and tasted good. The sauce for the salad and the steak added flavor to the food. If I had to eat here again I would eat just for the sauces. I have had the other foods here as well. All the foods have decent taste and maybe because it was delivered the foods were not as good because the heat has dissipated and some were soggy. Overall it was good to satisfy a food craving and when NYC lockdown/quarantine is over I may try the restaurant in person to get the true taste,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ichibantei-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Joshua E.,/user_details?userid=dwlsG4RiIbgzb8xboXk0LA,"Queens, NY",12/3/2018,3.0,I REALLY wanted to love this place but there were a few glaring issues. First of all I ordered pickup and requested 5:30; they called to confirm and while I asked for a little earlier they said they could only do 5:30 so I agreed. Basically I didnt walk out of there until about 5:50 which was really annoying. They were somewhat apologetic but they weren't really rushing at all. In addition they could have thrown something in to show that they were apologetic but alas nothing. I also asked them to make sure the order was right and of course when I got home and opened it up they got an order wrong which should have been porkbelly but was another chicken. Regarding the food I don't know if the chicken wouldve been crispy if you order at the restaurant but when I got home the chickens was marginally crispy and the flavor wasn't anything special. I love their menu choices but none of it was really awesome. I doubt I would come back but hope they can fix up their dishes and service. Try out their online ordering for 20% off.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ichibantei-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Once you go in, there are a good amount of seats, and what's pretty cool is that they play reggae music. There was only one man serving us, so it wasn't the fastest service. I tried the Chicken Nanban which is chicken with sweet & sour sauce and their homemade tartar sauce. The entree also comes with a bowl of miso soup (really good but was a bit too salty) and a salad (very fresh and the dressing was pretty good). The nanban itself was not bad, but for me it lacked a bit flavor and the chicken was a bit soggy. I think this place definitely has potential though. Maybe their ramen is better?

First I ask for the wifi and the guy working here gives me a spotty response saying it's only for employees. Cool I get it. My friend orders something and then changes her mind shortly after to downsize it from large to medium. The guy comes out with the large AND a medium and then tells us then that it's too late. My friend tries to clarify that she said she downsized it. How you about to scam us by giving us TWO orders of a large AND medium when she clearly said she just wanted one order for herself?! The worker continues to give some attitude with a b***h face saying too bad it's too late it came out. We're like ok we get it. Then 5 minutes later he comes and taps my friend on the shoulder and says we're gonna have to charge you for that you know just to rub it in. Serious? Just my two cents for future visitors.

Usually when my boyfriend and I go to an expensive NY restaurant for the first time we share a plate since they range from $15-$25 per plate and the check can go up to the $60s for a lunch. When we stopped in here we were going to try the wagyu, and when were about to be seated in the empty booth section, the waiter told us we had to order an entree for each of us if we wanted to eat there. I understand covid precautions, but I have never been to a restaurant that forces you to individually buy plates unless it was a buffet (understandably). I'm disappointed that during a pandemic when everyone is low on cash, and restaurants are already struggling, this restaurant forces you to have your own $15-$25 plate of food just to eat there.

This quaint bar serves excellent seafood like their mango ceviche (insanely delicious) and oysters (the one's we had from Canada were incredible) alongside perfectly made martinis (don't sleep on that happy hour from 4-7!). The staff here is extremely helpful and friendly and we made fast friends with Euan and Michael, both of whom had excellent suggestions and made our experience even that much more enjoyable. Perfect for a date night or just a night out with a friend, El Pinguino is the best way to start out your night, end it or just stay way too long and get very drunk on the sheer bliss of this place.

By this time the front desk did t want to bear any responsibility so they told us they never said the restaurant was going to open and they knew nothing about it.

The complimentary items (focaccia bread and fried zucchini slices) were unfortunately stale, but when we mentioned the issue with the bread, the waiter had the chef prepare a fresh batch of bread (which was not amazing but at least not stale).  For our main we had the squid ink frutti di mari pasta and the branzino, which were both excellent and were the stand-out items. We ended with an espresso and sambuca, both tasty. The service was pretty good until the end when it took quite a while to close out with the bill.

Joseph T.,/user_details?userid=CvjF3_8n1zrocIItaa3XUw,"Wildwood, NJ",2/7/2017,4.0,"This was a great little stop for a Lobby restaurant. It has its separate entrance outside as well walking through a small open courtyard right next to the Four Points Lobby in SoHo on Charlton. You walk into a bar area that is very very tiny with about six seats at the bar. It is a very bright room with little if any character. I walked in & the bartender was not very friendly or attentive. She was a younger girl with three customers at her bar and seemed quite overwhelmed and completely not interested that a customer walked in the door. I walked past her and towards the back of the restaurant which is where the other two rooms are located. You walk into the next one which again is quite bright but darker appointments were in the room and where the service station is. I was greeted immediately by several male servers who were very very attentive and friendly. I decided to sit in the back room which is where all the character is. The tables in that room are linen-covered and candle-lit. the lighting was subdued and quite nice. The mudic playing was very indicative of the Sinatra era. The room was darker in styling and very italianate. It has a glass ceiling with a large Center chandelier so that was pretty interesting. When it came time to order, the food was VERY good. It came out in a reasonable amount of time. They definitely lean towards a little more fine dining but nothing over the top and I would describe the atmosphere as upscale casual. I had some tortellini in brodo and it was very well prepared and extremely tasty. Followed by a fish oriented dinner of red snapper & jumbo shrimp sauteed wonderfully in a lemon wine sauce with a small side of spaghetti. It was very flavorful and well presented. A variety of breads came out during the meal as well as separate complimentary dishes of assorted olives and sauteed zicchini to enjoy. There is a bar and open wine list which is also quite inexpensive and you can definitely find what you're looking for. Pricing was very reasonable and the atmosphere was okay so I'd say this is a great spot to just pop in if you're wandering around Soho and looking for something Italian. Mario was one of the attendees to my table & he was over and beyond attentive to all needs while i dined.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-marino-ristorante-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I am nowhere near being a bar attender, but I can make a better tasting and looking one at home. While having dinner I had some martinis (which were a bit better but not worse the price whatsoever).

The five stars were all deserved, so much so that I activated a Yelp account just to write this review. My parents came from northern Italy so risotto was a staple at special occasions. I also enjoy making it at home. I decided to order it for us as an appetizer and they obliged me as I kind of worry about risotto and didn't want it to be my main - just in case... It knocked my (our) socks off. It was perfectly creamy and the radicchio and arugula flavours were unbelievable. The last time I was blown away by a dish was a plate of pasta at a small neighbourhood restaurant in a suburb of Rome.  Hats off. Oh, and all the other food was great - Etna chicken in a balsamic reduction, the Sammarinese chicken, the artichoke and mushroom appetizer even the olive bread... My wife and I have eaten at a lot of restaurants in many places and it is great to chance upon such a wonderful spot in a ""burb"" of NYC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-marino-ristorante-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

All I can say is San Marino is a warm delicious in so many ways Italian restaurant. They really are a traditional 'old school' Italian restaurant. From the vanilla lighting to the attention to every detail of comfort to the DELICIOUS variety of their menu they PLEASE!  The service is great and warm and they really want to make you happy and satisfied. I travel to NY many weeks in the year and always stay at the Soho Four Points so I may enjoy the comforts of San Marino. The owner Sammy is very hospitable, friendly and really wants to please every customer - in a genuine way! I have been there more than 20 times and any time I go to NY I am ALWAYS sure to go back. It is comforting like home and I love having a nice Italian dinner there (or even drinks and an appetizer). Attention to detail is superb. They want to make you happy so if there is something you need or want just speak up and they will make it happen!

Wailana W.,/user_details?userid=gEnzvwRpeGam6UBV66Wp1g,"New York, NY",3/27/2023,3.0,"The pork belly buns were nice but they are smokey in flavor and sous vide'd so they are nice and tender.  Not a big fan of that ham flavor but this was good. The brussels sprouts were flavorful and did the trick to get a veggie fix.  Pass on the bing.  It is nothing more than naan and some kind of sweet chili jam. The meati nuggets were a tad spicy and perhaps should have been made with the sweet chili jam from the bing.  My favorite was the crispy potatoes with the notes of sour cream and crunchiness.  It was comforting and tasty.  Overall, the bites were a smorgsbord of ideas and flavors, some tasty where you want to eat the whole thing yourself and not share with your companions (e.g. potatoes), some where 1 piece was perfection (pork belly bun), some where you can't eat but 1 piece (meati nuggets) and some where the description and expectation were too different (bing) and the deconstruction dessert which was a disaster in presentation but you still ate it.  Go here for the view with a group.

We ate off of the restaurant menu which is a great value because it includes a drink and two courses for $45 a person. I had the best iceberg salad of my life. Typically iceberg salads have no flavor but this one did. I really like the sesame on it. The Palmer was a lemonade and I love how green it was. Really yummy. The waffle was average. It could have use more apple and more flavor. My boyfriend had the chicken burger which was a really nice portion. Feel free to ask for a knife and fork for that burger!Service was attentive but not overbearing.

Nicole B.,/user_details?userid=QxJ2YrfZtHjXurI9m3h9qA,"San Diego, CA",10/28/2022,2.0,"I was really looking forward to eating at Momofuku Ssam Bar but unfortunately had a very disappointing experience. I've eaten at his restaurant in Las Vegas and have always had an incredible experience. With that being said, the food was ok but the service was awful. We made a 9:30 year reservation and received a call around 8:30 saying that we could come by earlier. We weren't able to so showed up a few minutes before our 9:30 reservation. We were rudely greeted by the hostess who seemed to be extremely upset that we had shown up so late (at 9:28 for our 9:30 reservation). I understand people want to call it a night early sometimes but don't offer reservations at this time if you're not capable of delivering on the David Chang experience. So once they begrudgingly sat us, the waitress comes up and says kitchen is about to close so you have one shot to put in all your food. There's definitely a more customer-service appropriate way to say that...anyways we ordered the ssam set which was overall very good. Drinks were also solid. The meats were all good and I really enjoyed the salad. The raw fish dish, hamachi I think, was a little fishy but the bing and salad made up for it. The meats were all tasty and the star of the meal. We ordered the oysters which were pretty standard but the $55 cacio e pepe rice cakes were not worth the price tag. You could tell throughout the meal that they were trying to rush us so they could get out of there, which really deterred from the experience. Once again, I know everyone is tired and overworked but we're pretty low maintenance so I just ask for a decent experience when we're paying to go to a nice restaurant. The subpar service really put me off to coming back to this restaurant. Would not recommend it unless there's a turnaround and more focus on service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jane L.,/user_details?userid=_W1HZ_lW34YUjCIFIVrHFQ,"Queens, NY",10/24/2022,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this new iteration of Momofuku Ssam Bar. I was a big fan of the old location and appreciated how intimate it was and how it reflected the David Chang swagger of the other earlier Momofuku restaurants. That vibe is nowhere to be found in the new location. It feels like an overpriced tourist trap geared toward people who have a lot of money to spend, want to dabble in some gateway Korean food (and/or perhaps are not comfortable with venturing to K-town), and want to see and be seen. It looks like it was designed for social media posts. That being said, the food was decent. Our group participated in the full Ssam tasting menu and liked all of the dishes. Nothing was exceptionally memorable for me other than the salad (randomly). All of the dishes were very ""safe"" and not terribly exciting, but they were well executed. The service was good until the end, when we were asked to leave because they had to ""free up the table,"" even though all of the large tables around us were unoccupied. One other observation that I found to be somewhat interesting (as an Asian) was that I didn't see any Asians among the many staff members who were working there the night we went. I find that unusual for  an Asian restaurant, but perhaps this just happened to be case the night we went. Ultimately, I doubt I will return to Ssam because it just feels like a ""new Coke"" version of the old location, but I do think the overall experience would be enjoyable for most people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Delicious and fun to eat.  For the second course, we had raw scallops. It was a bit of a letdown to find out that they changed the kimbap dishes I've been eyeing to just crudo... Of course, it was a mistake on my part to make the assumption but really hope they keep carrying the kimbap :') And if they do I'll definitely come back for that.

Painful and bizarre experience this evening in the Seaport. Arrived early to our dinner reservation at the bar. Waited a while for someone to offer us a drink but eventually bartender did so, and we ordered, happy and excited to eat at a restaurant we've missed in the pandemic, and had never eaten at since its move from the EV. Had the wine list and menus in front of us as we began to cheers our first cocktail and look at the menus. A person--server, manager?--came around to our bar seats in a nearly empty restaurant (there was only one other person there), reached over me and plucked away the wine list. I said in a friendly way: ""I was planning on looking at the wine list for dinner."" The person looked at me with deadlights, coldly saying: ""Should I bring it back or were you planning on holding it for the duration?"" with an edge. I looked around in confusion. ""Do you need it right now?"" Again, deadlights. As if I were holding open the train doors during rush hour preventing the world from moving. She said fine, keep it and brusquely left. Her attitude was the opposite of hospitable. It was provocative, and scornful and ad hominem. It's hard to convey the strangeness and the low grade contempt/rage of the person talking to us in this review. Who cares about the wine list? Not me! Certainly was happy to relinquish it if someone else needed it! But there was no one there in the restaurant besides us and this person's attitude was nothing but disagreeable bordering on hateful. My partner and I looked at each other in bewilderment. We debated what to do and agreed we had no desire to stay for a meal after such a strange and odious interaction. I paid the check for two cocktails and we left, abandoning a dinner we had been looking forward to for a week. I explained to the hostess the reason we were leaving on the way out. She seemed to intuit why we were leaving but didn't apologize, only said she hoped we found a place to eat that we liked, as if we were hard to please, entitled guests.

Had never been before and it's a local spot I had walked by before so I wanted to give it a try. We arrived around 8:00 PM without a reservation and were seated within about 15-20 minutes. I thought it might be quiet on a Wednesday, but while we were waiting someone else asked for a table and we realized 3 other couples were waiting after us! We sat in the back which was cute and romantic. It rained heavily during the meal which actually added to the atmosphere since we were protected by the transparent roof! It was warmer in the backyard than the inside which also looked nice but not uncomfortable as they had fans throughout. My partner and I noticed that it seemed like maybe a server called out; there was one guy literally doing everything from hosting to grabbing drinks to serving food etc. He was a champ! Service was still reasonably paced and I just couldn't believe how good this guy was. Despite doing a million things at once I still felt like he provided personal attention and was easy to get a hold of, like when we wanted the check. Pizza was nice and thin and crispy and filling!

Price is too high for only three balls and they fell apart & just tasted like mixed up ground beef with no binder/cheese/seasoning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-camillo-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The nasi lemak awakened all of my taste buds in my mouth in the most wonderful and magnificent way that when I close my eyes now, I can still taste the pungent shrimp paste and crispy little fishes. It was incredibly satisfying, delicious, and magical!!! Love at fist bite. The dish was so powerful and good that it detracted me from weird smells that permeated from the restroom into the dining area.

It's a no-frills cafe where you order at the register and grab a seat after. We sat at the bar/counter seating in the front, and there were some small tables that fit 2-4 diners in the center. I ordered the Nasi Lemak and Kaya Toast. The Nasi Lemak had a delicious sambal and tasted like a home-cooked meal. I loved the pandan coconut jam in the kaya toast, and wish they sold this as a separate item you could take home. Overall, flavorful, well-portioned, and reasonably priced Malaysian dishes in a casual dining environment.

The kopi was literally just instant coffee and extra 50 cents for iced (why?). The hainanese chicken was very dry and the rice felt like it was left out for too long (1/5). The toast was probably the best (4/5). The food would have been fine, if it weren't for the awful attitude that the cashier had.

Grabbing lunch, I highly rec adding their soft boiled eggs to everything. They make a beautiful add to every dish. Whether it is hainan chicken rice or any of the noodle dishes wet or dry. Love love love. I also ordered this time a fish ball soup and chicken wings just to try them. Nothing particularly special about the fish ball soup but it is just a nice warm add for winter.

The staff was great and everything seemed organized despite how busy it was. The interior was very cozy. This was my first time having hokkien mee and Malaysian coffee. I am a huge noodle lover so having both egg and vermicelli noodles in one dish was awesome. There is plenty of protein since you get shrimp, really flavorful pork belly, and a whole egg. I wonder if there may have been some type of belacan or shrimp paste that gave the pork broth a slight funky umami flavor. I wish there were more vegetables though. The packaging for the bek kopi is so fun. The kopi was not too strong and not too sweet.

Samantha P.,/user_details?userid=wq093efXVMp4CA5BqPLwqA,"Marlboro, NJ",9/20/2022,4.0,"I have a bit of mix feelings about this restaurant. The first thing is that I loved the Kayan toast. However, it would have been better if eveyrthing was spreaded more evenly. The first few bites I took from the toast was a glob of butter but because of the pandan flavor of the Kayan, I instantly fell in love with this spread. I also got the Nasi lemak which was  super delicious. This was my first time having Nasi lamak so I started to crave for more of this dish ever since I tried it from here. I also got the kopi coffee which honestly was not the greatest. I felt like it was a bit too bitter and watered down. I also got the Pulut tai tai and the Pulut inti. It was pretty heavy and sweet. I didn't realize how great the combo is with the sticky rice and the Kaya jam. As for the kuih talam, I felt like it was better off not having the sea salt taste. The prices are a bit on the higher end but overall I would probabaly only come back for the Nasi lemak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We came on a weekend for lunch and luckily snagged a table inside. The restaurant is pretty small so you might need to wait a while for a table. Portions are pretty small, so it's a good idea to order quite a few things and share. My absolute fave was the Kaya Butter Toast, which was fluffy and sweet. The Nasi Lemak was tasty as well and came with a delicious sambal. The Pan Mee was good too, but I felt like the flavors were more one-dimensional so I might get something else next time. Chilled Spicy Sesame Noodles were a a cool noodle dish with lots of creamy spicy flavors, great for hot days!

Their drink menu is an extensive list of milk tea, coffee and milo mix creations. I highly recommend try the weekly and weekend special if you can because you may not catch it again for a while. The kueh chap was so fragrant with the five spice but also such a light dish even with the fried pork belly. If you love flat noodles you definitely have to try it. The kaya toast is a must at Malaysian places and pairs well with a coffee or milk tea.

Ivan C.,/user_details?userid=2MXQHkLzqHyR1s3bwefl-Q,"Queens, Queens, NY",8/28/2022,1.0,"Went in with decent expectations because of all the reviews but was extremely disappointed with the food as a fellow Malaysian. The pictures for the food from this restaurant they are probably zoomed in 10 times to make it look presentable. Don't let them fool you. Price is obscene for the amount of food, one plate of their chow guay teoh is probably 1/4 portion (or less) of a full dish from any other Malaysian restaurant. Nasi lemak portion was disappointing, even the original nasi lemak wrapped in a pandan leaf back in Malaysia is way bigger size than that (cost 4 times less). Their signature milo French toast let me WARN you, stay far away from that no matter how unique it sounds to you because it is NOT worth trying. The French toast is drenched, some parts of the toast were burned and didn't taste like milo at all, the whole presentation just look sad and soggy. The cashier staffs seem like they were clueless about the orderings at all time. I don't know how they receive 4 stars because I felt generous giving them one star (After spending a whole $130 with family members in this restaurant we concluded the only thing that's worth a star would be their drinks (mediocre at best) Seek everywhere else for Malaysian food because this place is just not it. It was a shame for them to call this Malaysia Traditional food, none of the food quality or QUANTITY are even close to a traditional Malay place. Take my advice or you will pay dearly for it no pun intended.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Mike Z.,/user_details?userid=2x6lunLLmvWXw2Jpe_3SVg,"Manhattan, NY",9/5/2022,1.0,"Overhyped and gimmicky. Had a line outside the restaurant when we arrived for lunch (took that as a good sign.. must be good if there are people waiting to get in!). Oddly though, even though there was a line outside, there were also plenty of empty tables. Anyway, we walk in, and the waitress asks if we want to dine in. We said ok, and then she said it would be a half hour wait. I told her we'll just grab some takeout then. We got on the line to order food. Wasn't really a huge wait, but felt a bit unorganized. We got to the front of the line and ordered.. the lady working the cashier had to talk to us through some super old intercom system (not sure why, since she was like 2 feet away from us). Could not understand a word coming through the intercom (again, they probably just put that awful intercom in there for that gimmicky street food feel). The lady finally pulled the intercom away from her face and just spoke to us directly, and I could understand her crystal clear! Then she asked us if we wanted to take it away or dine in? Huh? Dining in was an option???? The first waitress we saw told us it would be a half hour wait! Anyway, since we had the option to dine in, we just did that. Paid the cashier, got a number, and found an open table by the window. The food came rather quickly. Everything tasted mass produced and made without any love. The Hainan chicken was dry and had zero flavor. How can dark meat chicken be dry? Everything else was forgettable. They served the drinks in ziploc pouches instead of cups... again, gimmicky and probably unnecessarily environmentally unfriendly. When we were done, we had to bus our own tables (even though we tipped at the register already... but whatever, that's fine.. it's important to tip the staff regardless). Even bussing our tables felt like a gimmick. They want to have the street food vibe, but they are charging Manhattan sit-down restaurant prices. Have no issue with paying more for good quality food, but this wasn't good food. Oh, but on the bright side, you get flies for free! There were flies all over the dining area. Hate to see what type of health code violations go on in the kitchen. Didn't finish our drinks, so brought them with us. Went back to our car, and realized that cars here have cup holders and not ziploc bag holders.

Benjamin B.,/user_details?userid=kVFo_IdWbM-sriAHKc0fxA,"New York, NY",3/13/2022,4.0,"Really cute Malaysian cafe with some very solid food options in a very casual setting. I had the tok tok mee, they do the dry noodle version of this dish and  it definitely hit the spot. Kaya toast is also really good here, honestly a pretty simple dish but toast with coconut-pandan jam is always great. Beef rendang  was pretty bad though, feels like a home-cooked braised dish in the bad way. Turns out slow braising beef does make it tender up to a certain extent, if you over-do it then the beef will end up dry and stringy which is what happened here. The curry itself tasted pretty good but if that dish was all that I ordered, I would have probably given the place 2 stars. As it stands though, I feel the place does a great job at bringing Malaysian cafe culture and street food to NYC just stay far away from the beef rendang. Only other annoyance is that the place is extremely popular and they don't do reservations so expect to wait a while.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Susan R.,/user_details?userid=yYtDRF62nwvJFZX-O2Ha5g,"New York, NY",2/17/2022,4.0,Pretty good homemade tasting Malaysian food in the Chinatown/Lower East Side neighborhood on East Broadway ( there's a Citibike rack across the street next to Seward Park .) We got the Sotong Goreng appetizer which is Calamari but it's a lot of little tiny squids with dipping sauces. Also the Pulut Panggang which is sticky rice with shrimp paste. I'd say the squid was better (and I'd get potato curry puff if they had it that day but they didn't.) I had the Nasi Lemak which is a dry anchovies and peanut over rice and is the national dish of Malaysia. Definitely mix the sambal on the rice ! My friend got Tok Tok Mee which is chewy noodles with shrimp and pork and he liked that. I also had Calamansi ade which taste like lemonade. Best thing though is the Pulut Tai Tai which is a not too sweet dessert of blue sticky rice with Kaya jam made from coconut! Delicious. I wish I had got more than one. That was $3.75 and wrap in banana leaf. The peanut mochi is warm and good on a cold day but it's enough for 3 or 4 people to share because it's so rich so be aware! I'd recommend this place.

Sharon Y.,/user_details?userid=5hNpHRwkaFYB7T65ao2tPQ,"Woodside, NY",10/12/2020,4.0,I appreciate the way that the food is reasonably priced! I got the hainanese chicken rice to go (the rice isn't pictured). I LOVE hainanese chicken rice especially the rice so I do wish I got a bit more rice but that's okay. It comes with three sauces so that makes it extra special ;) they give a good amount of meat too so that's good since many other places give you mostly bones haha. I'll definitely be coming back to try their nasi lemak and basically everything else on their menu. It also sounds and looks so yummyyyyy:),https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My favorite was the Chilled Spicy Sesame Noodles, which were really yummy and a good level of spice. The Hainan Chicken was also pretty good, and the rice is served on the side, rather than with under the chicken. The French toast was decent. The pandan chicken tasted pretty good, but it's definitely very rich in flavor so it can be pretty filling. It is a bit sweet (probably from the pandan). The Michael Jackson was also decent, but tasted a bit watery to me, so I would probably order a different drink if I came back. The white coffee was good, and it comes with a biscuit.

Helena Z.,/user_details?userid=n1VrCXs-vPo1GLS1FL3rNg,"New York, NY",5/5/2021,5.0,"This place is BOMB and makes legit Singaporean food that is super cheap and tasty on top of its authenticity. We got the nasi lemak, the kuih salat, the pan mee, and the otak otak. The nasi lemak is the most popular for a reason; super yummy with the dried anchovies - and honestly enough to split between two people. We were full after just splitting that alone. The pan mee noodles were also super flavorful and not too salty; however, maybe because we waited a while and got it to go, the noodles all stuck together. The soup itself though was very good - so I would recommend eating the soup first if you order it to go. The otak otak is definitely spicy and not in a traditional way; it has very strong herbs. We didn't get this with rice which was a mistake since, again, the herbs are very strong so the rice would have been good to cut it back a little while still allowing you to enjoy the strong flavors. Last but not least, the kuih salat was a nice dessert to end on - not overly sweet and light.

Since it was to-go the toast isn't going to be crunchy still so I don't have a problem with that. Oh boy they're so generous on the pandan coconut jam!! The jam would literally fall out when I bite into the toast!! I love this feeling!! The pandan coconut jam is not overly sweet, and it has a hint of coconut, tasted super fresh!

I came here because the menu looked interesting and I was unfamiliar with the items on it, so I wanted to try it out. We got the kway chap, kaya butter toast, and a curry puff to eat. The curry puff had a decent amount of spice and was very thick inside, it was delicious. We also got the kaya butter toast to try, which was made with such soft milk bread and a flavorful butter. The mixture of pandan and coconut flavor inside was so tasty and super light on the stomach. For my entree, I got the kuay chap which was wide noodles with eggs, tofu, pork belly and a dark soy sauce soup. First off,  I have never tried anything like this, but it is so delicious and I would definitely have it again. The noodles were so soft and they have a generous amount of toppings. As for the service, the staff was so friendly and helpful when it came to recommendations. I would definitely come back here and try some other stuff on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They have extended their menu with more main dish and appetizer, what a thrill it is for us. We ordered a few to try. 1st two dishes are appetizers. My BF liked the pandan chicken because he liked how the banana leaf smell is integrated with the chicken as they were grilled together. I loved the lobak because it was well seasoned with 5 spice, pepper and all other spices. For main dish, we ordered the nasi lemak and pan mee. Loved the coconut rice, and ikan bilis. Loved the handmade pan mee and the broth.

My baby and I loved the kaya toast. She only had the white bread, but it excited her nonetheless, whereas I had the kaya to satisfy my sweet tooth :). We also sampled the lobak, pulut panggang, coffee, spring rolls and some other dishes for which we couldn't recall the names of. More importantly, what was memorable was the flavor and the nice kick that accompanied every bite. I took off one star because I wasn't a fan of the space and the table placement. A staff dropped some dishware and glass came flying everywhere, and it got pretty crowded, so my seat was nudged and pushed a few times. Either way, it was a great dining experience and I would surely return for some more amazing small dishes to share with my family.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We had the kopi and it was a little bitter but I think that's how it is supposed to taste like.      The nasi lemak was spiced and flavorful.

Chris H.,/user_details?userid=jmSIjX2GMkIBXNVDXw2tyA,"Sunnyvale, CA",7/14/2019,4.0,"Kopitiam brings back fond memories of my Singaporean mother making me classic breakfast staples such as Malaysian Kopi Tarik, Teh Tarik, or even a cold Milo drink. It also helps that the interior is set up exactly like a classic Singaporean hawker stall complete with the colorful chairs and walls. Aside from the aforementioned drinks, we also got the classics such as the Prawn mee and Hainanese chicken. The Prawn Mee was amazing, bursting with shrimp flavor and coated with a generous heaping of fried shallots - even on a hot summer day, I could not help but slurp down all of the broth. While the Hainanese chicken was prepared in the traditional style, I couldn't help but notice that the green scallion and ginger sauce accompaniment was a bit watered down and lacking in flavor. In addition, the chicken rice balls were over cooked, causing the rice to be a bit on the mushier side. Even with that in mind, I am still willing to forgive Kopitiam for so faithfully taking me down memory lane with their other traditional dishes we tried such as the ondeh ondeh (sweet potato rice balls) and Kaya toast. I am looking forward to my next visit where I can hopefully bring my mom as well!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were a little groggy from the night before having been woken up at 2 a.m. by our party boy neighbor and his party pals but the wonderful flavors and caffeine concoctions woke me right up. We both had cham, a coffee/tea/condensed milk combo. A little more bitter than you'd think, as the tannins in the tea really come through in a big way but still quite good. I started with a curry puff to whet the appetite. The gf said it could do with more salt but I thought it was good as is. We then shared the peanut sugar french toast and the fish ball soup, both of which absolutely slapped. The french toast had that floofy fluff I crave and all of it was covered in the peanut-y goodness. Really good. Not as sweet as I was expecting but I mean that in a good way.

Rein C.,/user_details?userid=I1j4x5jie4VKuksHGhkfnA,"New York, NY",10/13/2018,3.0,Unlike some reviewers I didn't have any issues with customer service. They make it upfront that you bus your own tables. When we had questions about the menu etc the waiters were very helpful. The food however was underwhelming. It's not a SE Asian restaurant where there are lots of mains offering. Which is ok. But what they offer on the limited menu should be absolutely perfect and they were mostly ok. Nothing was bad at all. Just all very mediocre :( there was a line and we waited about 15min for lunch on a Saturday.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I have no idea what this is supposed to taste like since I've never had Nasi lemak but I don't think I would order this again. The Kaya toast was jgood, I was expecting more butter, it had a decent amount of the pandan coconut jam. Lastly the duck tongue was pretty flavorful, with the right amount of crisp.

Though the bowls look small, don't let it fool you; there's a lot of food. I struggled both times to finish the food It's a self-serve/ almost cafeteria-style spot. Let's talk about food and what I recommend. I REALLY liked the Kaya Butter Toast and Pulut Tai Tai (sticky rice), they had the same pandan coconut jam that made me fall in love with them. Kaya Butter Toast was crispy but soft and fluffy. Pulut Tai Tai with the jam was really good, but it would've so much better of the sticky rice was a bit warm and a little softer. My next favorite thing was the Curry Puffs and Chilled Spicy Sesame Noodles, if you can handle spicy I think you should give it try. The curry puff was stuffed with a lot of spicy and creamy curry and crispy crust made it delicious. Chilled Spicy Sesame Noodle was oily (chili oil), but I think the salted egg added more flavors and the cucumbers cut down the oiliness and made it taste very fresh. This dish would be good for summer. The next two dishes, I would only recommend if you like dried or fermented fish. Pan Mee and Pulut Panggang were not bad, but not my favorite either because I am not the biggest fan of dried anchovies and shrimp. Last but not least, Fish Ball Soup!

Delphine P.,/user_details?userid=uTQLDYTNXxmYeoQNT0L0kg,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA",9/20/2020,5.0,"I can't say enough good things about Kopitiam. I love the sesame noodles. I get an extra bowl of noodles on the side (sometimes, depending on who is working, gets confused because it is not on the menu, but the owner always charges me the same price as an extra bowl of rice). The desserts are INCREDIBLE. I love the morning glory blue-stained sticky rice with grated coconut on top wrapped in banana leafs. Another favorite is the honeycomb cakes, which are super moist and rich. I opt for no sauce on these, though, which they usually drizzle all over the cakes--too sweet for me. The cakes are already sweet, and the sauce on top makes me feel like I'm going to be sick. The pandan coconut dessert is also very very good. As far as drinks go, I like the Michael Jackson one, but considering he was a pedophile, I think it's highly inappropriate and unappetizing (to say the least) to name a drink after him. This is my only criticism of Kopitiam. Do not name drinks after abusers, especially the most egregious ones who harm children.

W R.,/user_details?userid=pTQuN9U0NOCtl1B2grcNBg,"Snohomish, WA",2/12/2020,3.0,I loved the lobah which reminds me very much of the Fujian five-spice pork rolls. Anchovies seemed to be a big part of the Malaysian cuisine; 2 of the dishes we ordered had anchovies and after a while they were indistinguishable. The Hainan chicken was on point and so was the spinach. I don't love the ambiance of this place which is why I give only 3 stars. The tables were small and the stools were super uncomfortable. There was no place to hang coats and not much room to wait for next open table. The place is popular obviously but if I were to come back (just for the lobah) I would only come in the summer.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Maybe I was spoiled by other Malay places, but there was no curry in this nasi lamak. There was a whole egg tho . But I'll go elsewhere for it. I def recommend their lychee mochi! $5.44(after tax)!

We ordered nasi lemak, pulut panggang, bandung, and butter toast. We preferred the nasi lemak to the pulut panggang, probably because of the textural contrast of the fried anchovy. Those two dishes were a little salty to my taste, but that may just be the Malaysian food style. We were quite impressed by the butter toast: it tastes very coconutty (pandan?) and buttery, the toast is well crisped, and went well with the bandung.

Kopitiam has lost its literal hole-in-the-wall charm that made it so appealing to me in the first place but the expanded seating and cleanliness of the new store are two things I can get behind. Another improvement is the menu availability-- no longer will I have to wait for specific days of the week to order certain dishes. The quality of the food doesn't seem to have changed, but I did notice the packaging of their iced teh tarik is now in a cute little plastic pouch, much like what you would find throughout most of Southeast Asia.

Jeffrey W.,/user_details?userid=AUXfZGmUfTbz-JtYq6_ykw,"San Diego, CA",2/19/2019,4.0,Finally I visited this place. Came on Presidents' Day and it was pretty empty. It is a cafe so you order at the counter. Very cozy space and a place where I would get coffee. The kopi Tarik was very tasty similar to a viet coffee but not as strong. We ordered the nasi lemak which was ok. For the price I was thinking it would be a larger meal and other garnishes. The oh chien was very good. You can taste the oyster and omelette was a little under which I like. They spicy stir fried duck tongue was delicious. I haven't had duck tongue in over ten years so having this made my day. The sauce lured well. I would come back and try the other snacks and dishes.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Seth H.,/user_details?userid=ptV0LZNhmTm4_HZMUlfnsQ,"Weehawken, NJ",12/18/2018,4.0,"I've had mixed experiences with Malaysian food in the past. From inedible sardine soup (won't mention where), to mind blowing Roti Jala at Kedai Makan in Seattle. Regardless I went in with high expectations and boy were they met. The Nasi Lemak came out quickly and was accompanied by an excellent sambal sauce that complimented the crispy anchovies and perfectly cooked rice.  The cold sesame noodles were tasty and reminded me of wontons in chili oil found at many Szechuan restaurants throughout NYC, but would have been better on a warmer day. The pan mee soup was good but lacked a defining edge after all the anchovy in the Nasi Lemak. Regardless, it was tasty and the homemade noodles were a great bite. The cross cross shrooms had a depth of flavor that's origin is really beyond me. Coconut, cumin and chili combine with something else wonderful to make for a firefly climax of the meal. Served along side a tight packed bowl of coconut rice to cool it down, delish. A very satisfying meal that only looses a star due to being spoiled by Kedai Makan. It's not you, it's me, I swear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Ada W.,/user_details?userid=dFhT_lhcm1Oo79nVWDw1-A,"Brooklyn, NY",5/12/2016,4.0,"Came here by myself and ordered the iced white coffee, kaya toast, and the nasi lemak. They were all good. I'm usually a black coffee drinker (no sugar or milk) but decided to try the white coffee since it's so popular. It was pretty good. Tasted a bit like coffee with hint of milk tea.  Note that it is not as strong as black coffee. It was also not too sweet which I liked. The kaya toast was sweet and good. The anchovy rice (nasi lemak) was flavorful. They have a side of spicy sauce which you can mix into the rice yourself. That sauce was pretty flavorful, and quite spicy and salty. I don't eat anchovies often and don't really like or hate them, but first several bites tasted pretty good. After a while, it starts getting salty. I had to alternate between eating the sweet toast and the salty rice to be able to finish everything I ordered.  I intended on coming here for snacks, but ended up filling myself with a meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Next door to the ever crowded trendy dimes, this modest eatery serves authentic and super tasty Malaysian food, drinks, and sweets. Service is super friendly and patient! I got the iced teh Tarik, oyster omelette special that comes with sweet chili sauce and sambal, and a small piece of these yucca/coconut cakes they had on display. I'm Taiwanese and I love my oyster omelettes to no end but this Malay version blew me away and dare I admit this - I think it's even better. The sauces it came with were PERFECT and packed quite a bit of heat, but the iced teh tarik was just what I needed for that. I was quite full after the omelette because it is a decent portion so I did not have room for the pulut inti that I originally wanted, but the staff recommended the yucca cake and I was not disappointed! It was a bit chilled, tasted not too sweet, and had a really fragrant coconut taste to it. Everything I got was amazing and I'm sure everything else on the menu is too. The only thing I wish they had was more space and better ventilation because the smoke from cooking really does get everywhere and it did bother my eyes and all my clothes and hair still smell like smoke. My best friend is Malaysian and I adore her moms cooking and this place sent me right back to my childhood - I couldn't stop raving to my friend about it during and after my whole transcending experience at this lil hole in the wall.

I ordered a iced milk tea it was delicious! The main reason I went there was to get the coconut jam and the sambal chili, I have yet to try them but I ended with more items than that. I also had the otak-otak - I bought 3 of them and tried one immediately it was aromatic wrapped in the banana leave and it was quite a large one but very very spicy. They did not spare the use of fresh chili peppers that I could tell you. My nose was running so I told my husband he probably should give it a miss. I liked the spicy aspect but flavor wise I thought it was a lightly lacking in some of the flavors and the texture was not quite what I expected from the ones I had in Singapore. I liked the nasi lemak it was well executed flavorful coconut rice and spicy anchovies/peanuts, the sambal was good. I just had the kueh lapis, the layered cake it was not too bad not as soft as expected but still tasty. I thought overall everything was good but a bit pricy.

Later on in the day I finally tried the Nasi Lemak and the Pulut Panggang...I was able to taste the individual ingredients ssssssssssooooooo good, it brought me back home to Indonesia, very similar taste and culture. I was very satisfied and the staff was so friendly, they made me feel very welcome. See you definitely soon guys!

Helen Y.,/user_details?userid=wHxDyAegrNiUzqXBKjAbvQ,"New York, NY",1/20/2016,4.0,"This modest coffee shop and eatery delivers on some very good Malaysian food, redolent with the spices of the country and complex with the five flavors in good Asian cuisine. The Nasi Lemak was a delight, a mound of fragrant rice that had good coconut flavor. The saltiness of the anchovies was offset by the sweetness if the sauce. With a few slices of cucumber as garnish, it was a solid winner. The Pulut Panggang , a log of glutinous rice with a inner core of minced lemongrass flavored shrimp thread, was beautifully presented wrapped in a striped green leaf. The garnish of cucumbers on the side provided a contrasting crunch and the sambal sauce on it added seasoning.The staples holding the ends was a modern touch perhaps necessitated by a need to seal with speed. Yes, string would have been more apropos, but at $5.50 an entree, one can't expect Master Chef presentations. The log was quite tasty, albeit a tad sweet when it came to the sambal sauce. Neither dish was overly spicy, perhaps that and the  extra sugar a slight concession to the Americanized palate. Portions were good for one, if you are a hearty eater, order two meals or more. The place is clean but small, with two small counters and if I remember, four chairs. Chubby and burly folk, take your order to go, unless you want to cosy up to some stranger. Service here is on the slower side. This isn't fast food but food prepared with love. Be patient. The staff are sweet and the food is worth it.

Henry Y.,/user_details?userid=uwy3e_csX0iE2R7FmMqGMw,"New York, NY",1/10/2016,5.0,"This place is dope. I don't say that because the food is so phenomenal that it deserves 5 stars alone, but rather that Kopitiam fills a distinct vacuum in the Manhattan gastronomic world, where Asian food is common but authentic Malaysian food is rare. You've got Chinatown already, which while ridiculously disappointing still has some decent restaurants popping up here and there. There isn't necessarily a wide variety of Vietnamese restaurants, but there are plenty to also be found in Chinatown. Thai food is scattered aplenty throughout the city. Indian food's got its hubs as well. Filipino food has firmly entrenched itself with Maharlika and Jeepney, but Malaysian food's only got Nyonya, and even then Nyonya has gotten so bad in recent years that it's not even worth going to. Enter Kopitiam, a pop-up shop in the truest since of the word that has seating for 4 people max located on the fringe of Chinatown. Reasonably priced along with a fairly diverse menu, a trip here will almost always hit the spot. The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming as well. I'd personally recommend the crab ball, butter toast (oh so divine) and the stick rice with shrimp floss are all good. I've tried the Nasi Lemak and I've come to the conclusion that I'm more turned off by the dish itself than by Kopitiam's iteration. I've been to Chomp Chomp, a Singaporean restaurant in west village that also serves the famed Malaysian dish but have found it to be pretty disappointing. The sesame noodles here are decent but it tends to be overly salty and oily. If you're really hankering for something filling I would recommend the french toast with condensed milk (a note here that condensed milk is to SE Asian dessert food as mayo is to Paula Deen's cook book). Oh and I'd ask for off-menu items when you get there. On one particular evening, we were served a mint egg drop soup that hit the spot. Overall, I'd highly recommend Kopitiam as an introduction to Malaysian food. For the time being it's very cheap and very accessible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ester P.,/user_details?userid=v2AvHs1eIi1IvjFzU6nmQQ,"Los Angeles, CA",10/16/2015,5.0,"In this lonely city of New York, all I want is some comfort and coffee on point. I found both at Kopitiam. It's a cozy restaurant run by a lovely couple, Kyo and Nan. Kyo told me that the menu was inspired by her childhood memories in Malaysia...the food she ate as a kid in the street and at home. All of her nostalgia is fully present in her food, and it feels so good in my stomach. I had been looking forward to Kopitiam's opening since I tasted their treats at the Queen's night market. When I finally got to visiting the store, she recommended Nasi Lemak, a rice bowl with stir fried anchovies, peanuts, and hard boiled egg. It may sound a bit too ethnic for those not acquainted with anchovies, but once you taste it, you would be surprised at how that spoon continues to shove back in to that bowl. The taste brings back everything: taste from childhood, the memories of my asian background, and the smell of rice from home. The final fulfillment came with the coffee that Nan delicately prepared. It was delicate, potent, yet without acidity...All in all, it just defined and made my saturday morning. Thank you and looking forward to seeing you lovely ladies again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kopitiam-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Even when standing in line, the menu and font style as well as the decor is similar to taqueria's in LA and in Baja California. The service was decent considering how long the line was when I arrived. Now for the food. I got 2 tacos (1 carne asada & 1 adobada) for $13 after taxes. If the prices were closer to the cost of tacos in LA or Tijuana, I think I could give 5 stars. Overall, this is indeed the spot I would recommend for anyone visiting NY and wants tacos.

At first the line and ordering system was a little confusing, but I think it works out great. He wait in line order at the cashier. then you take your ticket just left of the cashier, and they put together what you want I'm asking what your topping preferences are and tortilla preferences are. The flavors are so amazing! I would recommend to get the Carne Asada as that was everybody's favorite! It's so busy, sometimes the sauce bar is a little low. But don't skip out on the salsa. There's no seating, just a bunch of standup areas so it's to go grab a quick bite to eat. I did get the fried quesadilla with Kearny Asada, although good, I would recommend the tacos over it because it was very heavy with a fried tortilla.

As the name of the restaurant states, their tacos are second to none. For this meal, I got the Pollo Asado quesadilla and the taco, Carne Asada taco and the Abodaba taco. The grilled chicken here is probably the best protein that they have with rich flavors and simply not try at all. Along with the guac on top, the chicken protein is definitely my favorite. The Carne Asada is the steak protein and that one is great as well, the meat is quite tender. The Abodaba is the pork option and if you add on all the additional s including the pineapple topping, there are lots of flavor to that taco. If you're feeling hungry, make sure to go for the quesadilla which is only priced a little bit more than the taco.

Jesus S.,/user_details?userid=RHdkTKHd68nrUeZVz_xUAQ,"New York, NY",11/21/2022,5.0,"Best tacos in Manhattan based on my experience. They are not cheap but they are packed with meat. They are close to ""traditional"" ""true"" Mexican tacos. I don't think most tacos in Mexico would have as much meat (I've been to plenty of taquerias in Mexico), but this is not necessarily a bad thing. The downside is that you don't taste the tortilla as much. They make their own tortillas as well so not tasting the tortillas more is perhaps a bit bad. My criticism is really slight though. The flavors are amazing. The meat is great. The sauces are great. The lime station is great. They use the traditional ""trompo"", which you rarely see in the US. The other place that uses a trompo in NYC is tacombi. The tacombi tacos are more expensive and too salty.

Went back over the weekend during my visit & the tacos were still absolutely phenomenal packed with flavour! I do highly recommend corn tortillas over flour as to me it provides a teeny bit better flavour compared to flour but make sure you mention that as you order. Lime & sauces are located on the side to add to it. You'll find the menu on the right side wall by the cash area. They're about $5USD each which is a very good price for the quality that it is.

Every time I've been here, I've seen a lot of people waiting to get tacos, and inside it's always filled with people eating--it's quite hard to find a place to eat if you're planning on doing that! The ordering is quick and efficient. You tell them what you want, you pay, they give you a receipt. And then you move down towards the people making the tacos, and you give them your receipt and they make your order for you. It gets a little hectic so if it's your first time here, it might be a little crazy. But even so, I've been back here because I love the tacos I've gotten from this place.

Adrienne W.,/user_details?userid=QdORP-eI-bp5KBYtrSyw1Q,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/14/2022,5.0,I've been searching for authentic Baja California street tacos & proper Mexican food since moving from SoCal to NYC. I've been utterly disappointed for almost a decade that the city that touts its internationally famous cuisine could be so deficient in a quality street taco - offering only battered & fried versions of a fish taco or Tex/Mex options - pathetic... This foodie cannot be more excited to have experienced proper street tacos here! All the tacos were just tastebud treats and the experience also very taco-stand-true. There's always a line out of the door when I visit these days because you can't keep a good taco hidden! Where have you been Los Tacos No.1 ??? My search is over & I'm most satisfied with my new favorite authentic taco place in NYC. 5  would definitely recommend !!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You a choose between corn or flour tortillas and they're topped with onions, salsa, cilantro and guac I believe. These tacos are incredible! The meat has this deeply grilled flavour and the toppings are nice and fresh. I could easily eat at least 4-5. Off to the side are some extra hot sauces and pico you can add.

I've had this bookmarked for a while but haven't had the chance to check it out until now. As expected, there was a line to get in. They have a sign indicating estimated time but I found that it was much quicker, which was great because I was HUNGRY. I ordered the Carne Asada, Pollo Asado and Adobada tacos to try. Ordering was seamless and then you're directed to the assembly section where you're asked a couple of questions as to how you want your order - corn or flour tortilla and toppings, in my case. If you want to dine in, there's counter space and a few seats by the window for you to choose from. I absolutely love the Adobada taco - it was so well marinated and tasty! The Pollo Asado was a close second. Honestly, you can't really go wrong. It definitely exceeded my expectations.

N N.,/user_details?userid=rr9_0-wgDFVntzwQ-VcC_g,"New York, NY",7/4/2021,5.0,"For my birthday weekend, l stayed close to Chelsea Market, so I decided to check out this taco spot that everyone's been raving about. The first thing you should know is that there is always a line no matter what time of day that you go, so be prepared to wait for at least 10 mins before ordering. Honestly speaking, I wouldn't care too much about the lines because these tacos are definitely worth the wait! I tried the pollo asado and adobada (pork) tacos and both were fresh and cooked to perfection. You get to pick whether you want it on a flour or corn tortilla and if you want everything on it (onions, cilantro, salsa and guacamole). I opted for the flour tortillas and everything on my tacos. I also tried horchata for the first time and it was so delicious! I loved this spot so much that I went back 3 more times during my stay.

Being slightly skeptical,  we stopped by and had a few tacos for lunch. The line was out the door and on the sidewalk, but it moved decently. It only took us about 15 minutes to get our food. The place is pretty chaotic and a bit disorganized, but it worked. We got to the counter and ordered a pastor taco and a carne asada. We paid and they gave us a ticket while asking us to slide down. There were multiple stations where you gave the guys making tacos your ticket and they gave you your order. This took less than 5 minutes. Trying to find a spot to sit or stand was tough. We ended up crammed in the corner. We dug into out tacos and they were good. They were certainly above average, but not life changing as they had been described. The flavor and texture was nice on both. Overall, we enjoyed our visit. It was nice to try out one of the highest rated taco spots in the area, but it was a bit more hectic than I anticipated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nick C.,/user_details?userid=PPTV5ry-LXvA1lEQMosdow,"Manhattan, NY",5/13/2018,4.0,"There never used to be much on this block but thanks to a fellow Yelper, I decided to give W. 43rd between 7th and 8th another look and found Los tacos #1. It is a large place-there is no place to sit down-all eating is done standing or taken away. I got the steak tacos [3] on corn tortillas withe the works-onions, cilantro, salsa and with a nice dollop of guacamole on top. You place your order, get your ticket and then bring it over to someone who prepares your food. The food was very good-tacos somewhat small. There is a condiment bar on one wall which you can use to customize your meal. Soda is pricey-Fantas In glass bottles are almost $4 each. Due to the fact there is no seating, it is a very quick meal. I would recommend and return-great for a quick lunch or pre theater [right behind the Lyric theater]",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We had only been to the Chelsea Market location before and were excited to see what the Times Square location was like. As other reviewers have said, there's usually a line but it moves fairly quickly. Although it was busy, it was easy to find a spot to stand and eat our tacos. We ordered the al pastor, carne asada, and nopal on corn tortillas. After a brief wait, we were rewarded with warm fresh colorful tacos. See pic. They were juicy perfection and quickly scarfed down. Almostttt as good as the Chelsea Market location - I found the al pastor to be (disappointingly so) just a tad saltier than when I had them at the 9th Ave location.

Also, they don't charge for guacamole which is always a plus considering most places do. Fine for a quick bite/snack, but I wouldn't go for lunch or dinner. Also, standing only.

The line moves fast though, and on a Saturday evening we had ordered food within 10 minutes. It's fairly loud and confusing but you give your order to the cashier on the right, then take your receipt to the guys in the middle who make your tacos. It's easier to just shout your order out and say if you won't corn or flour tortilla and ""con todos"" aka all the toppings. I recommend corn and con todos, and both my husband and I felt the pork tacos were the best ones. We ordered 2-3 tacos per person along with chips, salsa and guacamole which was the right amount of food for 4 people. Overall it came to about $15 / person.

Eterna T.,/user_details?userid=S0T7laoGM6lq02Dg4aP8rA,"New York, NY",6/17/2019,5.0,"The adobada aka pork tacos are so tasty! Los Tacos No 1 are my favorite tacos in the east coast hehe. Even though I think there are still better tacos in California, they easily rival any of the best and personally I think they are much better than Tacos El Gordo. The store is standing room only, and after ordering with the cashier, you take the order slip and pass it to one of the cooks behind the counter. The funny thing is that the quesadilla is just the regular taco with a bit of cheese sprinkled in haha so I wouldn't get that option! I believe they also can do crunchy fried taco shell if you request it (not on the menu) but tbh I found it a bit too greasy and heavy even though the first few bites were really good. I think you probably need to order 3 to 4 for a full meal, and you can pick up salsas and limes at the counter.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was close and I was craving Mexican food, so we decided on Los Tacos No 1 - Being from California, I think Los Tacos is the only thing that comes even close to Mexican food on the West Coast, although it does cost a pretty penny to eat there. Tacos run from $5-7 as do their other goods, and they don't serve burritos. I thought for a taco that expensive that it would be more food, but alas it was just as small as normal tacos are. The quality of ingredients they use and the way they cooked it was really what sets it apart from other Mexican food places, and though I was a little salty about paying $6 for a carne asada taco, it was so good that I had to get another one. Would recommend for people wanting authentic Mexican in the city, although be prepared to pay a lil more than you probably would've elsewhere! Pro tip, they even have real Mexican Coca Cola made with cane sugar so be sure to try it out!

April K.,/user_details?userid=5DLeXZ3ghivbgacb7OVW2g,"Newton, MA",9/4/2017,5.0,"Excellent tacos. Dare I say ""authentic"" even though I don't know what authentic tacos actually taste like? But I figure they are. Taste is phenomenal and they have an area where you can put as much salsa or lime juice on them as you want. The food is quick and easy if you want to be in and out in 10 minutes. My only gripes are that there's no seating, just counters. Carnitas is a tad too salty. And the drinks are way overpriced (I think it's like $2.50 for a soda but it does come in those old school glass bottles).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Located really close to Times Square. DO NOT LOOK AT THE HUGE LINE AND GO AWAY! The service is super quick and the line goes really fast. There's no seating available but lots of standing tables and that's how everyone eats it. The staff is super sweet and if it's your first taco experience they'll explain everything to you very clearly. We tried their bestseller Adobado taco, the vegetarian Nopal (Cactus) taco and from their secret menu Pollo Asado in a cheese shell taco. The cheese shell taco is actually a taco shell made out of CHEESE! Yes, just cheese! We suggest you get one of these for sure because it is just too good! The Adobado was the juiciest taco I've ever eaten and the pineapple slice just makes it a perfect combination of sweet and spicy. The Nopal was pretty average and we only recommend it for vegetarians. We also got chips and salsa which was slightly disappointing after the tacos set such high standards. Chips needed a bit of salt to make it better.

She went ahead and explained how the ordering process went which she said first we order they give us a ticket after paying and we give the ticket to the taquero let him know how exactly we want our tacos it is a very organized process! Keep in mind the restaurant is super packed! So the customer services given was over the top! When I got my food I had very high expectations for the tacos and let me tell you.. every single one of my expectations were met! These are one of the most delicious tacos I have had.

I've gone a number of times now and had most things on the menu. I'm not usually a pork person, but the adobada mula (like an open-faced quesadilla) is my favorite. They also have horchata here, which is like, the most delicious beverage in the history of the world, but not super easy to find in Manhattan. Yeah, the whole line/standing/counter situation sort of sucks, but again, it's authentic. It's a great place to go for a quick meal (the line moves fast) on your own (because it's pretty easy to find a spot for one person to squeeze into at a counter).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Julie H.,/user_details?userid=eMahxfaTxvQDCuD_VEfipw,"Rockville, MD",12/30/2017,5.0,"These tacos are amazing! With a choice of flour tortilla or corn tortilla, we got the carne asada (grilled steak), pollo asado (grilled chicken) and adobada (marinated pork) with everything on it. These tacos were worth the long walk in the cold and every penny it cost. They are super authentic and delicious with a bar of sauces to choose from. Mouthwatering. I added some pico de Gallo and hot sauce to the tacos to enhance the flavors of the tacos. However, the tacos itself were extremely flavorful.

It's like the wild west, after you pay you have to forcibly hold your place in line otherwise anyone who hands their ticket to a cook before you will get served before you even if you ordered way before them, I watched this happen three separate times and of course each was an uncomfortable predicament -- it's pretty incredible how they make you responsible for fighting for your own food, it really throws a curveball into the equation of trying to have a calm bite to eat when trying to escape Times Square -- why can't they give customers order numbers and why can't the kitchen prepare orders sequentially?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This location is perfectly placed near Times Square, making it one of the best places to go in the area period both for tourists and locals who work near the area. That being said, there is almost always a line out the door. However, don't let that deter you, the line goes relatively fast and the food is very worth it. Once you pay for the food, you give your ticket to the chefs and they prepare the food for you. The place itself has a ""to-go"" or quick bite vibe. There are no seats, just standing tables (a really important flag for anyone with mobility issues). The restaurant has limited seating but I've always managed to find a spot after waiting a few minutes. As for the food, the quality of the meats here is really superb. I love tacos and have tried them all! My favorites are the steak and chicken - they are mouthwatering. I have friends who really loved the cactus taco.

I'm from SoCal so this definitely didn't compare to what I'm used to, and definitely nothing compared to the tacos from Tijuana or Sonora. With that being said here's why 2/5 stars. So when you walk in you order at the register and then once they give you a ticket with your order you go to the taco maker and he will prepare your taco. So my wife asked for a quesadilla with only cilantro. Well this guy still adds salsa, onions, and guacamole. And we told him that's not what we asked for. And he has the nerve to say ""well it's already made there's nothing I can do about it"" I'm paying over 3.75 for a damn quesadilla and he can't accommodate on his mess up! That was bs number one. So now my order was 4 tacos with everything. And just because we wanted the quesadilla with only cilantro he made my tacos with just cilantro even after I told him ""con todo""! So I tell him again and this time he does it with shitty attitude for no reason. But I guess with not many taco places in NYC some people settle for this.

Matt V.,/user_details?userid=XylbbdQ7PjTIYXOOMA9Cyg,"Clovis, CA",4/16/2019,5.0,"I'll keep this review short and sweet. I run a Mexican restaurant in central California that serves authentic food. I have eaten Mexican food all my life everywhere up and down the West Coast. when it comes to Adobada, I have eaten it by the border in Southern California all the way up to Northern California and believe me when I say outside of Mexico, the best place to get those tacos is los tacos no. 1 in New York City. Walking into this place it is kind of small and hustle bustle. The atmosphere is simple; counters to stand and eat at are scattered around or if you want to imagine that you are in a small dive in Mexico, that'll do. Spanish music playing through the speakers and workers shout orders to each other behind the counter. You walk up to a register and place your order and pay. Your food comes out the other side and prepare to be happy. People are friendly but the food is the star here. Carne asada tacos are mouthwatering, perfectly seasoned and authentic and the adobada as stated before is spectacular.  Truth be told that's all we ate, l wont be telling you just how MANY tacos we ordered though because I might embarrass myself. The offer nopales as well but we didn't have room in our stomach for anything else. If you love Mexican food and are in the New York area you must stop at los tacos number one in Times Square.  you will not be disappointed",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Amy Y.,/user_details?userid=kJO_EOBfA16-OzcBWGrDdA,"Menlo Park, CA",12/16/2018,4.0,"This taco place is worth the hype. Each taco is roughly 3-5$, depending on what you get. I got my order to go, and ate it after lugging it back from 43rd St to UES, and was still tasty despite that the tacos were no longer hot and a little soggy. Now, these were pretty tasty, so imagine how good they would taste if I had them fresh. I ordered a chicken, steak and pork taco, and then a chicken and pork quesadilla. Now, the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I really couldn't tell too much difference between the quesadilla and the taco in terms of the presentation. They tasted different, but the quesadilla wasn't the typical folded in half and with cheese. Maybe I just don't know what a real quesadilla is? Who knows. I also don't know if I actually got the right type of shells for the tacos. I think there was a choice between two shells, and while I chose the corn taco shells, they didn't taste like corn? But either way, the fillings were really tasty and fresh. I love that they give you a little guac inside each taco. So much veggies that there was no need for any additional salsa that they have on the sides for adding yourself. After I ate Los Tacos and then the next day had some tacos from a nearby UES place, I can definitely see why people like Los Tacos so much.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I got a corn tortilla quesadilla with salsa, guacamole and onion. My whole meal was around $10 for a soda and a quesadilla. Expensive - but worth it!

Angeleen A.,/user_details?userid=VVdnqcZ4sR2q3CMoc6j_9w,"Hialeah, FL",7/8/2019,5.0,"This place was awesome! Let's start by saying that it's about $5 per taco. The quesadillas are. It your standard quesadillas (they basically melt cheese in the taco and call it a day then they add condiments and it's officially a ""quesadilla""). There is absolutely NOOOOOOOO seating!!! You eat standing up on bar tops but I told myself I wouldn't be frightened by that nonchalant ambiance and seating. I was glad I didn't walk out that door! The service was great. The lady at the register was calm despite the ruckus around her. I could hardly hear her but she didn't mind repeating herself 3 times lol! I only really like chicken but my parents wanted carne asada so I ordered the chicken quesadilla and two carne asada tacos. I wasn't a fan of the quesadilla because of what I mentioned before BUT the carne asada was AMAZEBALLS!!!  I didn't end up eating the chicken ones because to be they were average compared to the juicyness of the beef.  They pour a green sauce over the tacos and you get to put pico and some additional sauces afterwards in the condiments section. This place is a must if you are having lunch near Times Square. Unfortunately....we were looking for dinner and we were so hungry we decided to stay So the lack of seating was unexpected BUT let me tell you that at 8:30pm that place was PACKED!!!! Plus the bar areas get cleared because since there is no seating people eat within 15 minutes and are gone! Go visit this place.

I tried the steak and chicken tacos in corn tortilla, with all the toppings it comes with. Absolutely loved the steak tacos - well cooked meat with a smoked flavor. Mind you, that the sauces they add are a bit spicy, but they truly complete the taco experience. They also have self-serve pots with different toppings, for customers to add some kick to their already-so-delicious tacos. These toppings include - medium sauce, spicy sauce, mild (tomatoes,onions,cilantro mix) sauce, radish, and arbol peppers! But be careful, even their medium is kind of spicy, if you can't take the heat you might want to first try a little. Though all these toppings were all freshly made and go well with their tacos, my personal fav was the arbol peppers. From the tacos, to the exciting toppings, to the setup where you eat standing (no seats here, only counters to eat while standing) - the whole experience is so authentic!

After explaining that I had just bought more stuff she still refused. I wonder what the owner would think on refusing to sell one taco or anything to a wanting client.

If there are better tacos than this in New York I'd love for someone to message me because this sets a pretty high bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I asked for corn tortillas, which is what had ordered. After waiting for more than 5 minutes my wife came over and said to go eat my one taco after she had eaten hers. She waited in my place for the other two tacos. We finally gave up having paid for 4 tacos and only getting 2, because we had to rush off to a Broadway play. No way to talk to anyone about it.

You first order and then give your ticket to the people preparing the food. I got the salsa on the side because I wasn't sure how spicy it would be. The tacos were out quick and I first tried the adobada taco. This one was my fav. The meat was juicy and the pineapple they add to it compliments it very well. The asada and chicken were good too but I think they needed a bit more seasoning. Both the green and red salsa were good not too spicy as I thought!

It wasn't sickly sweet, so if you're wondering, you won't feel like you're drinking sugar! The lines are usually very long, but it goes by pretty quickly. They are very efficient in taking orders, making the food, and handing it to you. Pretty straightforward once you're in line. Just follow the person in front of you, put in your order, hand the person your ticket once it's your turn, tell them if you want corn or flour (for tacos), package the selections of salsa and sauces while you wait, and pick them up! There wasn't much seating, so I can see how it's more convenient if you Togo the order, but standing and eating tacos is also an option too!

There is nothing special about it, it tastes like meat and tortilla and the salsa is below average. With this premise you should understand that it's an undesirable restaurant, and if I could give it less than a star I would. What caused me to write this review was the fact that it's pricy as hell and has nothing to offer. A taco will cost you about 5-6 dollars each, and they aren't big. The drinks will cost you 5 dollars and it's just a drink. What angered me the most was when I ordered their Mexican sweet waters, which weren't even good, they gave me one of those little plastic cups and filled it 3/4 of the way with ice. It was bad enough that they did this to me, but when I asked for a refill on the tiny cup they gave me, they said I'd have to buy another one for another 5 whole dollars.

There secret to success is not the meat as it has literally no flavor. The meat acts as a filler so you think you are getting your money's worth. Once you order your meat for your tacos, you are asked for what free extras you want. Most everyone says 'everything' and there in lies the flavor for the Tacos. There is a reason they give you free Guacamole for your tacos. No one gives free Guacamole. Walk to 9th Avenue. Between 42nd and 50th on 9th Avenue there are so many Mexican places to eat.

I'm originally from the south, so I find myself craving some good street tacos, al pastor or the like, often now that I live in the north east. When Los Tacos opened up a few blocks away from my work, I immediately went to try it out for lunch. Although there was quite a long line the first time I went, it usually dissipates within 5 to 10 or 10 to 15 depending on when you get there. Lunch time it's the most packed, but they take your order efficiently and the cooks serve you just as fast. You hand them your ticket once you order and they create the food for you on sight. I get the chicken and pork tacos with chips and salsa each time, and each time it's awesome. The meat is marinated well, and the toppings (cilantro, guac, salsa, onions) are all great. I like spicy, and the salsa is hands down the spiciest and best i've had in the city since I moved here. pro tip: if you want it to-go you'll have to mention it for them to give you a bag for your stuff because otherwise it's served to stay. There are also no places to sit, you just stand and eat your food, but I don't mind it.

Monique M.,/user_details?userid=Fn-ox8NmUY7RBh0XelPpvw,"Bronx, NY",7/31/2022,5.0,"Beautiful space with an upscale ambience! My wonderful friends brought me to NOMO kitchen to celebrate my birthday, back in February. It was way better than I anticipated. Firstly, NOMO is located within the NOMO hotel. A fairly short walk from the Canal street subway stations. Upon arrival, there is a beautiful lighted garden and walkway that offers great photo-ops. Inside was just as nice. The lobby is well lit with a variety of spaces to take photos or lounge about chatting. I loved the variety of colors, from the painting, to the lighted signs. Inside the restaurant gave off a beautiful rustic feel with sky light roofing, draping, big plants, colorful artwork, and big chandeliers. So pretty! My friends made a reservation via resy, so we were able to sit within minutes. They started the night with drinks however, I did not have any alcohol. We also did not partake in appetizers. For my entree, I had the half chicken with seasoned fingerling potatoes. The chicken was moist and delicious. I especially enjoyed the crispy skin. I honestly did not expect it to be so good. My friends also enjoyed their meals including: bone-in pork chop and a butternut squash pasta dish. We did not opt for dessert as we were going to a dessert bar afterwards. All-in-all, our meals were wonderful. Staff were also very kind and attentive; no issues. The ambience itself, was very upscale. I don't know if there is a dress code however, most people seemed business casual. We were dressed up fancy since it was my birthday. Overall, a wonderful, upscale experience. I would definitely return as I am interested in the brunch.

Kylie N.,/user_details?userid=OfmzfgZGAAZ1lXX_WYKSGA,"Jersey City, NJ",12/7/2021,5.0,"Lovely second experience at NOMO Kitchen. I haven't been here in years and I loved the brunch and decor before so I finally got the chance to revisit. It is such an instagrammable place, once you arrive, so definitely take some pics! Make sure to make a reservation as it does get busy and people do special occasions too. When me and my friend arrived we were seated quickly. It was right by the door to outdoor seating so the draft was annoying though. Our waiter came immediately and was attentive and nice the whole time. I'm the only one who got a cocktail, Soho Dreams, and it was so tasty! I love herbal-y drinks and this was one of them. For my brunch meal I got the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes with mixed berries and a side of eggs. I don't really like lemon that much but I do have to say it was really good and the taste wasn't too strong. Me and my friend were trying to figure out how they made the pancakes so thick and firm yet so soft inside! I originally ordered the French Toast but I have a serious nut allergy and the waiter let me know it was infused with nutella. Sucks! The pancakes are very filling so be prepared. My friend got the Roasted Tomato and Basil flatbread and that was soo good too. Prices are standard for NY...pricey but worth it in my opinion!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nomo-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nancy H.,/user_details?userid=WSzmzDcIjNrr1C4vyMj7iQ,"Brooklyn, NY",1/25/2021,3.0,"Super aesthetic restaurant inside a trendy hotel. The entrance of the hotel is gorgeous and perfect for pictures. Their outdoor dining setup is really nice, they have 1-2 heat lamps for every table and fire lamps outside. It is very nicely decorated. We made a reservation for dinner and arrived 20 minutes early but it was no problem and we were seated. There's a scannable menu. We ordered the truffle prosciutto pizza to share, and a pasta dish each- the lobster fusilli and the rigatoni with added steak. Everything arrived promptly, but the service was a bit slow. Besides taking our orders, we never saw our waiter. Our dishes were brought out by a different worker. He only stopped by once right before we were done to refill our water bottle that had been empty for most of our meal. The pizza was a great starter and tasted great. The lobster pasta was really flavorful, you could taste the lobster flavor on the pasta, and it came with a good amount of lobster. The rigatoni was really undercooked and hard. I like al dente pasta but it was just hard to chew. The steak, however, was nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly. Would come again for the atmosphere, but not the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nomo-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Alice W.,/user_details?userid=6nhZakiWSinWUu-NLOmmzw,"Queens, NY",3/28/2021,3.0,"My friend and I made a reservation here about a month ago for brunch since we saw they had outdoor dining and heaters. We specifically stated on our reservation that we wanted to be seated outdoors. The food was great! But the service was terrible. I got there on time, and they said that I had to wait for my friend to get there, which is fine. But when my friend got there, they seemed to forget that we reserved outdoor dining and made us wait indoors for them to prepare the outdoor area. The server seemed very grumpy and rude, and they also made a mistake when bringing out our order. My friend ordered a tea, but he brought her a coffee, and he gave us attitude when we pointed out that we never ordered a coffee. They also gave me a tea bag in a cup without any hot water; I had to ask for hot water which seems like a no brainer. It was also very cold and our feet were freezing. They had a heater above the table, but it would have been better if they had a heater on the floor too, or a different style of heat lamp that would properly heat the area more. 3 stars for the food! The food was delicious and filling, but for the price of the food, I'd expect better service. The food itself was also overpriced for what it was (dessert brunch items). And tea was overpriced, although I suppose that's common for most Manhattan restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nomo-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The waitress took over 10 mins to come to the table and then never checked on us after that. The manager noticed our annoyance and came to check on us twice. Had to keep trying to get the waitress attention for over 10 minutes just to ask for our check. Tables that came after us were served and given their food before us. Then the waitress double charged my card and then tried to deny it.

A bit on the loud side...music was playing even during brunch so it made conversation a bit difficult, but other than that a very cheerful place to have brunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nomo-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Phoebe Z.,/user_details?userid=9XhRQkHMKjbYsyfNFiOoPA,"New York, NY",9/27/2020,1.0,"Came here for brunch and it was horrible! Had reservations and there was no host outside, so we had to go inside the restaurant to get someone to seat us. The worker then told us to go upstairs to get checked in, when we went upstairs they told us to go back downstairs. What a waste of time! Speaking of time, when we finally got seated they waiter took forever to take our order. The people who were seated after us already had their orders taken. And the food took forever to be served!!! It took over 45 minutes for our food to be served. We had reservations at 10:30 and didn't finish until 1:00 and the manager told us that our time was over and we had to leave, we were basically getting kicked out. No one told us that we had a time limit and if the food didn't take so long to serve we wouldn't even be there for so long. After we started eating we ordered a side of bacons and we were worried that  it would take long so we asked the waiter how long a side of bacons would take and he said 2 minutes but guess what?! It took 20-25 minutes to serve and it was served when we were being forced to leave. And good thing we checked the receipt because they charged us for an extra mimosa and an extra steak and eggs and that we did not order and did not get. The waiter never came and checked on us, service was horrible, didn't like the fact that a 20% gratuity was added on to the bill automatically. If the service was good I would obviously leave a good tip but we didn't even get any service. Paid $50 for tips to a server that didn't even check on us to see if we needed extra water or anything. I know it's busy, so maybe the restaurant should get some extra staffs. Also food was subpar, ordered a medium steak got it well done. Had to send it back to the kitchen but took forever because the waiter never came back to check on us! Ugh save your time and go somewhere else with better food and service.

The scallop appetizer was underwhelming for $30+ and I could not taste the peas in the pea sauce. It was hard to get the attention of the waiters which lead to a lot of unnecessary waiting for the check. My father ordered a fish dish and the plating+ size of the fish DID NOT justify the price.

It may be pricey to some but it's well worth it in my opinion. I wasn't too hungry so I got the fish tacos and it was just what I needed. It was delicious and beautiful to look at.

I went with 3 other friends and we got there around 4 pm. There was no hostess in the front and so we waited a few minutes. I decided to walk up to a waiter to ask for a table, and he answers with ""we're closed"" with an attitude. Obviously we were confused sense they close at 9. Another waiter came by, he also looked irritated for some reason, and explained to us that they couldn't sit anyone else until 5. We even asked if we could reserve when they open it up at 5 again and he even seemed irritated with that question. We didn't understand why they were pretty much closing for an hour, especially sense there were still people who were eating and drinking there. We would've waited until 5 to be seated, but because of the bad service and unnecessary attitude towards us we left.

My friends and I shared multiple dishes; the duck ragu pappardelle, arugula salad, roasted chicken with scallions, rack of lamb with tzatziki and the steak & asparagus. All the dishes were flavorful, seasoned well, with decent portions. The standouts to me were the duck ragu pappardelle it was just damn tasty tbh, noodles were perfectly cooked and the sauce was full of flavor. Other standouts would be the rack of lamb dish cooked perfectly med rare and seasoned well & the arugula salad was simple but tasty and well dressed.

Paulina S.,/user_details?userid=uEqoISOQG3j8drDiW3nL-A,"San Francisco, CA",2/25/2020,2.0,"I am beyond disappointed by this place. It used to one of my favorite places in the city for brunch for a couple of years now, but the the past two times I went were shocking regarding the service and the food. First of all, they increased the prices significantly, which I think is not justified at all. 19$ for pancakes or a french toast?! I mean, I would be fine paying that amount if the food would be really good and the sizes relatable but we ordered the eggs benedict (also around 20$) and found them not even to be mediocre. We were still hungry afterwards since the size of the food was ridiculous. And don't even get me started on the service. The past times I went, the service was lacking more and more and I was surprised it can even be that bad considering that this place belongs to the hotel and that they offer (or at least try to) good service. We basically had to call for the waiter multiple times to finally get served, while it wasn't even that busy. And we were not the only ones to experience this. Would be great if they could improve on their overall service and I would happy to come back - but as for now I would not recommend this place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nomo-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'll definitely be back to try their brunch.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nomo-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I think my eggs Benedict was delicious, the eggs were perfectly poached, hollandaise was seasoned well and had the perfect consistency.

Wind was blowing at me repeatedly making the seating very uncomfortable and cold. When asked to have my seat moved they would say that the table was for four guests and we were only three. While our original table was also meant for four guests... Also they moved another table with guests when they asked because they were getting cold too. They should've offered me a table by that time too because our food was not even out yet and we've been sitting in the cold shivering for a hour and a half. We waited for about an hour to get our order taken and I asked for a waitress 2-3 times. The waitress was extremely nice but the hosts (the men in blazers) were unwelcoming and not attentive.

The waiter is nowhere to be found when taking your order. The waiters by the way, all egotistic and rude, wish they had a reason though. But regardless, I've been to many upscale restaurants in Manhattan and never received such poor service. Definitely won't be coming back. It's all hype, no good vibes though. Also, just to mention, people who came in AFTER us received their food BEFORE us. It seems like they like to serve wealthy looking Asians first.

The treatment I received was unprofessional, the waitress momentarily walked away and the manager was inconsiderate when I expressed my concern of the stains in my jeans and silky shirt.

The pancakes (baked lemon ricotta pancakes with mixed berries and candied pistachios for $17) were so beautiful! They were very thick and reminded me more of a spongey cake though--undecided whether or not that's a good thing, but great for insta. Margherita flatbread with mozzarella, garlic pomodoro, and pasil ($18) was good, though not extraordinary, and great to share (6 square pieces). Chicken paillard with tomatoes, arugula, and basil ($29) was mixed. Chicken was too dry but the tomatoes stole the show. We couldn't get enough of 'em.

Last time I came, the place was packed and everyone was happy and laughing and had a good time. The bartender made my Bloody Mary cocktail literally so salty. She most likely just dumped a bucket of salt in a glass. The pancakes were such a disappointment Jesse Olson is terrible. The pancakes came out soggy and lukewarm and literally fell apart when you cut into it. The pistachios were chewy and soggy (literally do not understand how someone can make a nut chewy), the raspberries were black and bruised, and the lemon cream was barely there. The potato hash remained okay. The staff of waiters had all changed and I was so upset because I was hoping to see the waiter who served me last time. He was an excellent waiter.

NOMO kitchen is a modern, upscale restaurant inside NoMo Soho Hotel serving mainly American cuisine. I came here for an evening dinner with a party of two. The place was fairly busy, but we were seated promptly. Kevin was our waiter and let me tell ya..this guy knows hospitality. He was attentive, helpful, and funny. We ordered mocktails and a bunch of dishes to share including the cheese platter, margherita pizza, truffle fries, and carbonara. I found the pasta dish to be extremely salty..probably wouldn't order it again. However, the rest of the food was good. Afterwards, they served the cake my friends brought. There was a cutting fee but because it was my birthday, Kevin took it off the tab. I think our total was $125 including tip, which was worth it given our experience. Do note that we were sharing dishes though! I don't see myself coming here often because of the price point, but realize that you're paying for the upscale experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nomo-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Unlike a lot of servers in NYC, Joe was really down to earth and didn't make us feel rushed even though he was really busy. He didn't seem to mind telling us what was good. 10 Stars to Joe for his patience with this indecisive bunch! I absolutely recommend going, super cool vibes and great service.

We were guests at the hotel for three nights. We were excited to see the restaurant was packed on the first night. When we came down for drinks and asked for a table where we can have a drink with friends, the hostess was rude and told us all the cannots rather than any cans. We brushed this off as a busy night for her. The bar was not ready for us so we were limited to a short list of options with a rude bartender. This morning, we came down after checking out to grab breakfast. The same hostess was at the stand with a half empty restaurant. We asked to be seated for 2 people and she told us it would be a 10 minute wait. I kind of felt like she thought we were an annoyance to her job. No smile, no acknowledgement we and everyone she is seating actually supports her paycheck. I thought I was at the Ramada Inn asking for Cheetos. The service in the restaurant is terrible. 10 minutes to order, 15 minutes to get coffee, wrong order came out, took 20 minutes to have the table cleared. The experience is so poor compared to the excellent food they served. They need a new front end manager. There are a million places to stay, eat and drink in NYC. NOMO may make it by for a few years on sucker guests but you will miss out on loyal customers. You are missing out on sales! I would say try harder but the team wasn't even trying.

Alle G.,/user_details?userid=-8o_13cu7pTtPLK_5rxP6A,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11/21/2017,1.0,"I'm an NYC local and had a good friend in town and wanted to take her to a super trendy spot with super good food. We decided on Nomo kitchen, and were anxious to get through the weekend just to brunch on sunday. Walking in, you're wow'd by the aesthetic and expected nothing but the best service to match the environment. We sat down and started looking at the menu and were so excited that 15 mins passed and we realized we had yet to be greeted or offered water. Looking around, you notice employees in every corner talking to each other rather than serving customers. I had to raise my hand and flag someone down just to be acknowledged.... i let it go and hoped my point got across that we needed attention. when our server FINALLY got to our table, she simply said ""are you ready to order?"" no ""hello"", no ""how are you doing"" and no ""any questions on the menu?"". AGAIN, we let it go, not looking to get angry and ruin our day... we ordered the margarita flatbread and our server responded ""it's actually not a flatbread, it's a pizza..... i think"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME. we told her either way it didn't matter, we'd still like it. she proceeded to be so confused, looking around as if she'd find the answer at another table? the whole situation was awkward as hell. we ordered a few more dishes and continued to have a good time... our pizza/flatbread came out and we waited for her to bring us plates, that we had to ask for. at this point we were just besides our selves that this service looked acceptable in the fact that she didn't seem flustered or overwhelmed or just did a really good job at hiding it. We finished our food, not surprised at the fact that we had to flag down different servers just to get us refills OF FUCKING WATER. also not surprised that i had to get up out of my seat to track down our server to ask for our check... who then had someone else bring it to our table for her, saw her process our payments and handed it off again to a different server to bring it back. at the end of our brunch, we flagged down a manager to bring all of this to our attention and didn't even offer anything in compensation of our time or experience. I kept count and by the time we left, 8 different staff members touched our table, not because we looked upset but because we had to flag someone down EVERY SINGLE TIME. But i guess you can't have it all right? excellent atmosphere, amazing food and the worst service i have ever experienced. i suggest an entire re-train of every staff member.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nomo-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Steph N.,/user_details?userid=rOeDctyq9bSnZsZUd8gvkg,"New York, NY",8/5/2015,5.0,"Tried a few dishes from NOMO Kitchen the other day as I sat at the hotel bar and they were delicious. Had the Tuna Tartare, Cauliflower, Mini Tacos and Truffle Flat Bread. All dishes were unique, each with their own burst of flavors - but as a person who loves truffle (and expected the truffle flat bread to be my favorite) - was surprisingly blown away by the Cauliflower! It was battered and fried perfectly (not too much tempura and not too crunchy) and the sauce was this aromatic and sensual blend of pistachios and chili paste - giving it a sweet, salty, savory kick (similar to a satay sauce but better). None of the dishes were heavy and just right in regards to starters. The atmosphere of Nomo Kitchen is warm, laid back and friendly. You don't feel like you are in downtown Manhattan with the beautiful chandeliers hanging over your head to give it a touch of romantic class. The bar inside Nomo Kitchen and out in the hotel lobby is comfortable and quaint. Definitely relaxing from the hustle and bustle. My Bartender of the night was Rob and he was amazing. Professional, friendly, knowledgeable and skilled! His drinks were some of the best I've had with the right amount of ingredients to not make any of the drinks overly strong in a particular ingredient. Perfectly balanced.

Literally we walked in and they made us feel like we are old regular friends coming back and we appreciated that. I love small menus because I feel like more attention and care going into the meal preparation and quality. We are not celery fans so we skipped that very popular dish. The terrine was lovely but for me the greens that accompanied the terrine was the star. Simple and fresh. The beef tongue was also flavorful as was the burger but the star was the trout. I will definitely return for this trout. I am a raw fish person but this trout was everything to me. We were too full for dessert so next time I will have trout all for me and a dessert and some cocktails. Can't wait to see what their winter menu brings. Things to bear in mind is that you are not really going to find a big entree dish here so if you are with someone with a heartier appetite several dishes may be needed.

Many seasonal options. Oh, the glory of the cheeseburger! It is a double, in the smashburger style, but every element is delightful.

We sat at the bar while we waited for our food . Bartender was very nice and attentive ! He made me a recommendation of the drink ""IYKYK"" which was sweet with a hint of nostalgia ! The inside was very calm and very trendy vibes . It is middle eastern inspired as is the menu so i was happy to see that . I order chicken sandwich in a pita with sweet potato fries and hummus . The sandwich was delicious!!! Very flavorful and tasteful . The sweet potatoes were surprisingly very good. The hummus sadly was not good at all to me but I grew up on hummus so I'm very picky with it . None the less it was a very calm environment in Williamsburg . I'll definitely be back soon !

Nadine J.,/user_details?userid=sGKK6LgRX_JAKcmELaJcqw,"Brooklyn, NY",4/17/2022,3.0,"Are you ready for the 411? Here we go...me and bae decided on this little spot for our after-church service brunch spot. Williamsburg was our choice and this little Israeli spot on the corner of Wythe and S 2nd Street! You could hear the multi-cultural music playing inside as the outside diners tapped their feet to the tunes that filtered outside. It felt energetic and inviting so we inquired on seating availability. The hostess was accommodating and was able to seat us in the almost filled cafe. I must say I am always amazed by restaurant decor and loved the NYC styled street light lighting inside the cafe. The noise level was adequate and could have a decent leveled conversation with bae during the whole meal. Now let me tell you about Dana! She was our server and initially I thought she was peppy but soon found out different. We ordered our meal which I felt was a little rushed but it was still fine at the time. I ordered the smoked salmon scrambled. It was tasty but it was a soft-scrambled which turned out to be a little too soft for my taste. I felt the softness of the eggs decreased it's ability to enhance its overall taste. I was a little heavy handed on the salt but felt it was still lacking in taste.  Bae had the French toast with scrambled eggs on the side. He loved his French toast which he said were perfectly made and not dried out yet soft enough even with the syrup added. His eggs tasted better than mine which I believe were due to the harder texture. His fresh fruit was delicious as well. The kiwi was the sweetest of all the fruits. Now let's get back to Dana! She started out pleasant enough but was surprised when she came back to our area and asked the family next to us how they were enjoying the meal and never turned to ask us the same question. Even after I thought she would at some point she never did. She was highly attentive to the other patrons which I clearly observed as compared to us. We never got water which she said she was going to bring, I had to ask for a spoon for my tea which she brought way after the busboy finally brought it to me and brought us the check without asking if there was anything else we wanted.   I wondered if she was rushing us for the table however saw couples and families that were there before us and who were still seated after we left so there goes that theory. At this point we decided to do Dana a favor and leave this establishment which she was clearly trying to make us do. I love visiting different places to eat and this is a spot I would love to come back to and try some different choices but Dana obviously did not want us to come back. We even tipped her to show her no hard feelings! For others I think it's worth a try and see if you have better luck! I would have given this a 4-star but the customer service knocked it down to a 3-star!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/12-chairs-cafe-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

With an Israeli-inspired cuisine, 12 Chairs knows how to brunch, lunch and dinner. I've been here twice: for brunch and dinner and I can confidently say that one meal is not better than the other here. For brunch I got the Eggs Siniya, which came with pita and for dinner I got a mediterranean salad. Both were tasty and filling. This place is well-priced too! It's also worth mentioning the $25 special for four small plates, which are easily shareable.

I have been to Israel several times and this place is the real deal! I've gone 2 times now and both times the food has been excellent. I highly recommend the hummus falafel as an appetizer: the falafel are fried to perfection, super crunchy and flavorful, but not the least bit greasy. And the hummus is smooth and delicious. The second time I came I got the lamb burger which had a tangy mayo sauce and came with a slice of feta cheese on top. It was cooked to perfection (I got medium) and packed with flavor. The service here is great as well, the food came out in around 15 minutes.

On the morning in question,  I arrived a little after 8 and was seated. The first strike against them is the tables are too low and being 6'1"", I was uncomfortable. Then the server had an attitude as if I should be lucky to be in his presence, what? He handed me a menu and went to fetch my coffee. He warmed up a bit as he sat down opposite me, and crossed his legs to take my order. I felt that was a little forward and unusual but I let it go. I commented to him on how the place always seemed so busy with a line of customers waiting which he confirmed, ""We're always slammed."" At this time there were maybe 4 tables occupied? I ordered the Shakshuka. He suggested, and admittedly, his accent was strong so I didn't understand everything he said as the loud Israeli pop music played. Anyhow, as I understood it, adding the Israeli breakfast was a good value and authentic, so I went along. Stupid me, I realized as the food was served, that I basically ordered 2 breakfasts and spent more than twice as much money as I had planned. I am usually savvy but it was early and I wanted to enjoy myself, not have my guard up. Lastly, the food wasn't exceptional, not terrible but nothing stood out. When I asked for the check and requested a to-go bag for the many dips that I couldn't possibly have eaten, I was handed a bag and 5 little plastic to-go condiment cups with ill-fitting lids that I had to fill, and the server disappeared.  I know of some people who don't tip if they've experienced bad service at a restaurant, but I'm not one of them. I always tip 20% or more if the service is good, that's just how I am. I know we're all struggling to exist in this insane city that, like the rest of the country, has gotten over the top expensive. The server's behavior was underhanded, and deceptive so he can get more money, very disappointing. On a somewhat positive note, I liked the menu choices for dinner, perhaps I'll give this restaurant another chance? Currently, I have no plans on returning.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/12-chairs-cafe-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
