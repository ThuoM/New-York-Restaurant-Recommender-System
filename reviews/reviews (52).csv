I've had better shrimp and grits, the mimosas will get you drunk but the service was REALLY SLOW. It took forever to get our mimosa refills and brunch is only 90 mins so we probably each got 1 refill. We spent $83 each for brunch and it was not worth it. It's $40 for the unlimited mimosas PLUS the price of your meal which is something that should be explained because we all assumed it was $40 per person plus tax & gratuity. Even getting our water pitcher refilled took forever. Getting cups took a long time too. I don't know if it'll be worth it to come back to this place again.

The food was definitely made fresh to order and flavorful. I was craving oxtails. I had a decent serving for what i see places serve these days. I asked for my rice to side and ordered mac n cheese. Mac n cheese was good.  It was alot of rice and tasted really good. I'm not sure who created that meme that Jamaicans dont make good rice cause that's a damn lie.

Was going to order an actual entrée but the appetizers took so long that we didn't even want to order any more food from there. It isnt the servers fault since she was covering a bunch of tables but as the customer it isn't fair to pay an automatic 20% tip when the server was not attentive nor did she offer water or utensils for our table we had to keep requesting for something as simple as napkins. But they included tip automatically even tho it was just a party of 3. So yea might just order take out from here but never dining in. The ambiance was okay everyone was frustrated on how long the food was taking.

My chicken and waffles was good and so was my boyfriend's French toast. Now on to the not so stellar things. 1. The shrimp and grits was literally soup 2. There is only outdoor seating, inside is only a bar no tables. 3. They advertise 90 minutes of bottomless mimosas for $40 on the brunch menu but fail to mention that the $40 does NOT include food. 4. The service was super slow. In the 90 minutes I only got two mimosa refills because the waitress kept disappearing. But when it was time for us to pay she made sure to HOVER over us.

I have had the salad and some other dishes, and they were good, but the main focus is always on the margaritas, and they always hit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantina-33-ridgewood?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I would prefer to continue going to the the very close by Hispanic restaurants for better flavor, portion and again price tag.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cantina-33-ridgewood?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sashanna W.,/user_details?userid=qdLC5NnCL4twv840FjtlYA,"Queens, NY",3/2/2020,4.0,"Ventured out on a Sunday evening to this new neighborhood joint for a quick dinner. This evening getting a table was relatively easy as the place was only about a third of the way packed. I can see this not being the case in the summer time. I had a frozen passion fruit margarita. My friend had a whiskey sour. Both drinks were well made. I ordered the pork tacos and he had pork burritos.  The tacos  were good- though a little on the small side. I do want to note that I did not leave there hungry but if you're used to more food order the burrito. It was definitely a nice size. There is a parking lot next door- though whether it belongs to the restaurant or the neighboring establishment I'm not quite sure. The ambience is very ""Mexican Restaraunt"" but I love it. I think this will be a great hang out especially in the summer. The prices were reasonable. They except cash and credit. Ill definitely be back.

I really want to support this restaurant. Nice inside and music nice. I also got two baked goods on the way out. They have a lot of gluten-free items. The orange olive oil cake was good, a bit dry. The blueberry custard muffin was good but hit some burnt after taste. Overall everything could have been a couple of notches better the day I went (1st time so was expecting 5 stars based on what I read). I am so sorry I had to leave this review. It is just NYC is expensive for restaurants and I felt like I maybe could have made this better at home. I am not in the restaurant business. Also they have a bunch of imported greek groceries they sell. I will have to ask my greek friend about the pricing on them. Overall they have great concepts here. My review is only for the food and I am sorry about that. 3+ stars and I say ""wow so good"" right away when I'm eating.

The spreads are good but wasn't blown away. It was a very enjoyable dinner because the service is just on pointe. The cocktail drinks are yummy! Order the spicy cocktail- forgot the name. Manhattan is good too. I would definitely come back for drinks and bread at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kristen M.,/user_details?userid=2YA2zn8Qh1sSB3rskiFW1A,"Floral Park, Queens, NY",10/20/2013,5.0,Ive been to many greek restaurants and this was the first that i loved! The appetizers were a small portion so you can get a few different ones and share so you can really get a good variety. The main dishes are not to big but just the perfect size you will feel content not heavy and full! The food is so flavor full its not plain and the flavor does not take over the food! The deserts are great and just the right size!!!!! I hate red wine i really do but guess what i drank 3 glasses of red wine it was amazing i loved it! I cant say enough about the food and the atmosphere the decor is so warm and inviting. I cant wait to go back.

That said, came here with my family expecting the usual experience and it was pretty bad.  Started with the hostess telling us she needed the table back within an hour and a half, which ok I get it but not a great way to start. Then all of the food and drinks we ordered were not good (Greek potatoes were cold, looked like frozen french fries versus the usual round potatos, other food bland and not great, drinks watered down) and the service was completely cold and indifferent to the point where it felt we were inconveniencing the restaurant. They also forgot our main course. Then took forever to pay when they had originally put pressure on us to leave on time. The worst part is on the way out we asked to speak with a manager and the hostess said he was busy so we expressed our frustration with her and she was completely indifferent and said ""oh, probably because we're just busy tonight"". I'm sorry - not a good excuse particularly at these prices.

We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated at a high top at the front of the restaurant.  We were told we were being seated there so we would not be rushed because a large party was coming in at 9pm in the back of the restaurant.  At 9:00 the manager asked us if we could move to the bar because he needed our table for the next reservation.  We explained why we took this table in the first place (so not to be rushed) but he didn't seem to care.  He only offered to buy our drinks at the bar when we told him we didn't want to purchase another round of $15 drinks.  There are more professional ways to have handled this, especially after dropping over $300.  Too many restaurants in NYC so I don't have to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Meg G.,/user_details?userid=i_1yW708yWe-C64RZAz8mA,"New York, NY",6/18/2018,1.0,"I am uncertain how this place was so highly rated. We came here for our anniversary bc we wanted Greek food, but had a bad experience. The feta was bland, the olives were meh, we didn't get bread, the salad was warm, the waitress barely made eye contact, didn't smile and was very odd and unhelpful and would disappear for long stretches. The herb stuffed peppers tasted like a Midwestern version of Greek - it tasted like it was reheated from the frozen food section. We were seated without menus or appearance of a waitress for five minutes (we should've left) and it didn't get better from there. When I asked our waitress ""K"" why the salad was served warm she said it used to be served with ice cubes bc that is a Greek tradition, but now that it is warm outside they don't serve it with ice cubes. Please, someone, tell me what that means and how serving a salad w ice cubes is a thing that is appetizing. Maybe in Athens they can pull this bizarre practice off, but not at The Greek. Oh, they also did this strange thing - they replaced the silverware btw courses and put the fork and knife on these black cocktail napkins, like it's a high end place. It strikes me that these strange choices made by the owners or managers. I will say the runners were busting their ass. And my husband - ever the optimist - liked the spare ribs. I wish so badly I could get this night back, but I can't so all I can do is warn the next person to avoid this place at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The decor was nice and the menu looked good so we stopped in. The first issue was the drinks we ordered, they were made incorrectly unfortunately, our waitress was MIA 70% of the time so we just drank them as they were, however considering they were $14 each I wish they had been made correctly. The main issue I had was our food took over and hour to arrive. A salad, a sandwich and the chicken screwers were ordered, the restaurant was dead and it still took over an hour (I know this because I got a phone call after we placed our order and while waiting I checked the time the call came through and it had been an hour). The waitress wasn't rude but we didn't really get checked on and waiting over an hour for food is excessive. I would have cut them more slack if the place was crowded but as I stated it was dead. The food was good, the prices were not bad but not good either, it's on the high side for what you get.

We waited a long time to even be served water and had to ask the hostess to go locate our waiter after he disappeared without taking our drink order.  When he finally returned (quite some time after the hostess went to find him) he was completely unhelpful at answering our questions and bordered on rude.  We ordered the spreads, the horiatiki and the Branzino.  The salad and spreads came out quickly.  The spreads (tzatziki, smokey feta, eggplant and trout) were all delicious as was the grilled seasoned bread that came with them.   It is a good sized portion for two people.  When the horiatiki came we noticed there were ice cubes in one corner of he bowl as if the waiter had spilled a drink into it and still served it to us.  We repeatedly tried to get his attention to point this out but he was impossible to call over.  We finally ended up picking them out.  This said it was a really tasty, well-balanced greek salad.  Once our apps were cleared we waited a LONG time for the Branzino.  When it came out it looked beautiful but was served with a very small portion of vegetables ( like four spears of asparagus and a couple broccolini leaves).  The fish was nicely deboned and perfectly cooked but a little lukewarm.  The vegetables were also well cooked but completely cold by the time they got to us.  For how expensive this place is (pricey even by Tribeca standards) it is not worth it.  The food is good and well cooked and the space is great, but once you factor in the portion size and terrible service isn't really worth the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Not too oily and cooked in a clay pot. You could taste the different ingredients and I think it may have been better than the one I had in Athens. Baklava was good, but I really want to try to Feta Cheesecake next time. They also gave us 2 different kinds of chocolate from Greece with our check which definitely distracted us from the prices.

Christina I.,/user_details?userid=XY_V0x09kIgYzkRqyomIFw,"Weehawken, NJ",1/21/2017,1.0,"I'll start off by saying that this place for food and esp service SUX!!!  I would've given it zero stars if possible.  We were a group of 5 that went for my brother's birthday late one sat evening.  I found the restaurant on yelp and saw the reviews so we decided to try it.  We got there about 10.30pm and they supposedly closed at 12am.  We started off by ordering a bottle of white wine that we had to ask the waiter when he was as delivering it as the appetizers had arrived.  Mind you the bar was right in front of the high top tables we sat at.  We ordered appetizers mainly and one main meat dish.  Only 3 of us were eating as the other 2 in the party simply joined for drinks.  The appetizers were horrible and tasteless. The only decent one was the croquettes.  For the main dish we ordered the lamb chops. Let's start off by saying they were cold, tasteless and flavorless. Since 4 of the 5 in the group are of Greek decent and one straight from Greece we know what Greek food should taste like.  During dinner we asked the obnoxious bitchy hostess/waitress if she was Greek and with a snotty tone she responds in English ""yes I am"".  I've never had a fellow Greek speak to me in such a manner ESP if you're of the same ethnic background.  On to dessert- the recommended feta cheese cheesecake was old and dry. The double Greek coffees were sooo sweet we sent them back for new ones esp since we asked for medium which is generally a hint of sweetness.  For all this garbage food it cost the 3 of us about $95 with tip.  A few weeks later I call the manager to complain of our experience.  He apologizes and asks that we visit again and he will personally ensure us a great experience.  So I should spend money again there I ask??? Doesn't even offer a $1 comp and he thinks I'll come back to try it again??? I wouldn't spend another $0.01 there let alone a $1.  This place is NOT only expensive, the service sux and the food is garbage!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We tried a selection of small plates - the spreads, stuffed grape leaves, the shrimp, oyster mushrooms, meatballs - the food was absolutely delicious (I recommend all of the above!), the service matched - some of the best food and service I've had in NY for a while.

First off I have to say I am a huge fan of Mediterranean food and this place could be my new favorite. We ordered Feta Psiti as an appetizer and it was insanely good. The feta is fried and served with honey drizzled over top, which amplified the flavor! When it came around to the entree, we decided on the Mixed Grill for 2. It was a great array of skillfully marinated and cooked meats with greek fries/chips. I honestly couldnt decide which  meat I liked more. We ended up ordering Tsasiki sauce to go with the mixed grill but I didn't realize it would be $6 charge per small bowl.

Ilias G.,/user_details?userid=LLOlTBOxTTtteLnnKuCeQQ,"Manhattan, NY",4/18/2016,5.0,"In order to be honest the Greek's ""Greek"" elements are mostly their wine list, some sense of hospitality giving free ouzo while you are waiting. Food is good but a bit overrated for my first full dinner visit (before I 've  only been at the bar) The ambience is absurd because it tries to be warm, cosy, industrial, and the result is a salad of badly combined ingredients. The remembrance is chaotic and reminds nothing of the restaurant's name ""Greek"". You don't need the stereotyped white and blue, but somewhere somehow the unique feeling of Greece. The patrons are the kind of people that apparently only know the generic kind of food and its byproducts that are presented as ""authentic"" or high cuisine in Manhattan. My experience was horrible due to the young Greek waitress one of the many that have arrived in NY after the Greek economic crisis. They have never tended tables before especially in America so they have limited capabilities and an attitude that is between don't push me too much, I am only doing this for some time. However because of the management's move to take the bill after what happened I am giving them five stars and I hope to return because their effort despite all the faults that I described above and they are according to my own point of view (that is not infallible) is worth supporting.

Ruben D.,/user_details?userid=ml0Il2T5JW_X0GEUxDCMfQ,"Newark, NJ",2/6/2023,3.0,So i was going thru instagram and found this place. We went yesterday and it was packed. The waiter really nice and told us 30/45min but it was way quicker than that. The inside is really nice so we got sat in the wooden mural tables. Really cool and private. The thai iced tea and lemonade are pretty good. But if they had an alcohol license and serve alcohol would of been a major boost. Anyway onto the food. He started with the popcorn chicken really good only thing missing was any type of sauce to dip the chicken in. Then we got the omurice with the demi glazed sauce it was pretty good. And finally the ramen. This is why my 3 stars bc its a ramen spot and the ramen wasn't 5* worth. Missing something the broth was way too sweet missing salt and something else as well. We had the number1 and number2 ramen. The desert was delicious we had the mango mille crepe cake. Anyways I wouldn't go back for the ramen but if im ever around and want some finger picking food then it will do.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kyuramen-chinatown-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Katherine V.,/user_details?userid=Ey5KfDYwM2wexzTyyeo3EA,"Seattle, WA",2/5/2023,3.0,"I feel like it's my duty to balance out the 4.8 star rating on Google and Yelp. For this price point, there are better ramen options in the city for food taste/quality (eg. menkoi sato, ichiran, toribro), but the vibe/ambiance here is more modern/trendy (if you're more interested in that than just food); definitely some cute seating! I sat at the bar which was spacious and nice for a party of 1. I ordered combo A (white garlic shoyu ramen) and found the noodles to be overcooked and the broth to be average (no special character/body); chasu was tender but nothing special. I also ordered fried oysters as an app and thought they were a great app, but they weren't a must-try item. I saved the bao to eat later (didn't really need it but it's the same price to order the pudding and ramen so thought i'd order the set since it's a better value). I'm glad I tried the matcha pudding, but note that it's small/personal-sized and it's definitely not concentrated with high quality matcha. If you want the latter, get a soft serve from the place attached T the front! Service was good until the end - had to wait more than 10 min for my card to be run, but the staff was really friendly. Overall, I think this is a decent spot for the neighborhood but don't expect it to blow your mind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kyuramen-chinatown-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

When dining here I feel the warmth and sincerity of each employee, there is so much care and effort put into such a satisfying experience. Some very memorable and unique dishes are the roasted oysters, each one possessing an exceptional taste profile that pair wonderfully together. I am a huge fan of the dressed oysters as well. The fluke tartare of course, is a fan favorite, but the Brussels sprouts, chicken bites, and gambas Al ajillo while seemingly simplistic bring so much to the palate.

My party required few accommodations and I had no trouble communicating with the manager regarding my guests' needs. Awesome cocktail selections including some non-alcohol options. Food quality was outstanding. Not like those typical big party catering that kinda looks premade-ish... On top of the decent quality, my guests all walked out stuffed which is another huge plus.

Having dined in many of the places that Chef Joseph Yi had worked I was really looking forward to this meal and it was fabulous!! The tasting menu had offerings that pleases a varied palate. Three raw oysters (of course added the optional caviar oyster) kicked off the experience with flavors varied from a mild spice to the cooling sensation of yogurt and caviar. The fluke tartare was almost too beautiful to eat. I rarely eat roasted oysters and was surprised by how much I enjoyed the  brown butter & vadouvan curry flavors. Surprisingly the cavatelli with italian sausage, ricotta, kale was one of my favorite courses and the sauce was light and flavorful. The branzino was perfectly cooked and another course that required a spoon so as to not miss any bite. The Thai Milk cake was a perfect ending to the food journey. We enjoyed a mocktail as well as sake and when a course was delayed, the server kindly offered me more sake which was welcomed.

First of all, the drinks are outstanding. We ordered the Saga Sunset and Bitter Apple and both were well-balanced in the taste of fruit and alcohol. We had salmon crudo and chicken bites as appetizers. The pistachio pesto added a niche crunch to the crudo. The chicken was like a remake of Korean Fried Chicken - supposedly coated in honey butter sauce but somehow the saltiness was a little too overpowering. For the larger plates we tried Nduja Mussels and shrimp risotto. The shrimps were really fresh and I personally like the added texture of the onions and scallions to the creamy risotto. However, the flavor was a bit one-note - I couldn't taste much except salty and a hint of spice from the chili. Thai milk cake was what caught my attention in the first place so absolutely had to get it. The concept of this cake sounds really fun - a tres leches with an Asian twist. The Thai milk tea sauce was no doubt the highlight, only wished there was more to soak both layers of sponge cake. The whipped cream and mango weirdly did not taste much so we basically ignored the toppings and ate the cake dipped in delicious Thai tea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sagaponack-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jessica M.,/user_details?userid=minwSQIetkOl7z95BGavYA,"Manhattan, NY",9/11/2022,5.0,"I discovered this absolute gem of a restaurant in the midst of the pandemic. It is now my favorite restaurant and it helps that it's only a block away from my apartment. At this point, I pretty much only sit at the bar as I consider it to be an extension of my own living room. The staff are incredibly warm, friendly, down to earth, and attentive. Morgan at the bar always takes such good care of me and makes unbelievably good cocktails that have just the right amount of complexity without being too much and taste just as good as they look. Kyung, the owner, always comes by to chat and to make sure we are fully taken care of, with a smile. They have been extra accommodating to me on a late weeknight, which is so appreciated. Friends, family, and probably anyone else listening has heard me rave about this place. The chill vibes, decor, and bar area set the stage for a relaxing experience and a true escape from the hustle and bustle of the NYC streets (that we love, but need a break from sometimes). The music and sound is loud enough but not so loud that you can't have a good conversation. The food is gorgeous to look at (especially the fluke appetizer!) and so delicious. I have my staples but I have not eaten anything mediocre on this menu. The brussels sprouts are like crack; the kind of dish you will try and fail to replicate at home because they are so freaking good at Sagaponack. I love that you can have a light meal or dive in to something heavier depending on your mood. The best part about this place is the lack of pretentiousness coupled with impeccably high quality food and drinks. It doesn't get better than that, especially with so many NYC restaurants that are overhyped and overly pricey and not worth it, in my opinion. Make Sagaponack your new staple restaurant. It's always consistent and I'm always guaranteed to have a good night :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sagaponack-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However, I was so disappointed at my overall experience at this place. First off, the service was terrible. The waiter came to us one time to take our order after like 20 mins (I had to go get her too) and another time to drop off the food. Water was also something that was not given to us, but I understood because we are in New York City. The food came and everything was so salty or super bland, there was no in between. We ordered a chicken fried rice and the rice was clumpy, with concentrated salty areas, it was not well stir fried. We even found a piece of raw chicken buried at the bottom. When I brought this to the waiters, they just took the plate and didn't give us a replacement and didn't take it off the check either. I had to argue with them to at least have it taken off the bill.

Just stopping by for a quick dinner after a rain and a sunset, the place was not packed at all despite the relatively small space, so we felt ok eating indoor (you could also eat in the individual wooden-walled cubicles outside). For every noodle dish you order, you can specify the type of noodle and way it's pulled and cut -- regular hand pulled, fat hand pulled, small wide hand-pulled, big wide hand pulled, knife peeled noodle, and regular rice, skinny rice, or potato glass noodle. Tried the Chicken and Shrimp noodle soup (fat hand pulled), which was not only tasty and has a great chewy texture, but also balanced well with the soup without too much herby flavors if those things would otherwise bother you.

The pan fried dumplings were fine. We weren't fond of the noodle soups (duck/house special/noodle dumplings) as the noodles were too soft, the duck soup didn't have much flavor, and we didn't particularly care for the house special soup flavor. The pan fried beef noodle flavor was good with a hint of smokiness to it, but I didn't like the knife peeled noodles as others recommended. If you cook chow fun, you know that chow fun noodles come stacked and cut into uniform strips that you have to peel apart. Imagine sheets of noodles stuck together like that, but this place uses a knife to cut uneven strips off (like peeling a mango). Each strip has 2-3 layers stuck to together and was cooked way too al dente. I don't know of the texture of the other noodles to make another recommendation as I wouldn't want it soft like lo mein either.  I would say get the pan fried over the soup if you end up here. I wouldn't make the trek to Chinatown just for the draw of the fresh noodle. We later saw a higher rated fresh noodle soup place in Chelsea Market, but I don't think they have pan fried noodles.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Carrie N.,/user_details?userid=Z4QJ_V9jid4IRG4191MQZA,"Lenexa, KS",8/1/2021,4.0,"It was so cool how they had small private rooms outside of their shop! There was also a/c in each of the private compartments so it was very nice, especially at the time I visited, it was so hot and then it rained. The heat and rain was no worry thanks to the box being secure from those things! There was limited compartments but I got lucky to get one myself. In order to order, I did have to make a phone call to the lady inside, telling her that I was inside one of their compartments and was ready to place my order. So, tip, if you do not get any help after waiting a bit, call them and someone will soon be out to take your order! The lady was to the point, take order, served order, gave bill,  then you walk inside to pay, then go. So, I gave their pan fried beef noodles a try. Omg, the flavor was simple and so good. I could taste that the noodles were indeed fresh! There was a chew to the noodles, however, the amount of beef was less amount than I was expecting. I may have to order their meat dish separately, along with the noodles, on my next visit! I would definitely be back and I highly recommend others to give this place a try! It is small inside the shop but if you're lucky, you can get a seat inside one of their a/c'd, private compartments they have, lined along, right outside their shop!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
WF F.,/user_details?userid=UYKz_YL1LQOzMrAhx9s32g,"North Caldwell, NJ",1/4/2022,2.0,We have frequented this place a couple of times before and the food was okay. But this last time we ordered the House Special Beef noodle soup and literally got 3 thinly sliced beef pieces and 2 small pieces of beef tendon and 1 tiny piece of tripe for almost $15! The noodles were plentiful but very doughy. Btw they even skimped on the veggies by tossing in 5 pieces of spinach. Soup was tasty but we are going elsewhere. Thanks but we can get more meat and veggies from other restaurants for less money.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This place is located on Doyers street so if you're not familiar with the area it can be a little hard to find since it's a twist and a turn off of a Main Street on a small side street that at times does not have through traffic and is set up with tables along the street and the street may even be painted. Anyway ... this is a no frills kind of place they stick you where they have room for you ... last time I went during a busy Saturday and was seated in the basement this time I sat upstairs... which I much preferred. Their noodles are fresh made to order and some of the best in the Chinatown area I think when going to a place called tasty Handpulled noodles you should in fact GET THE NOODLES you won't be disappointed. I like that you have many thicknesses that you can choose from I prefer the big wide ones.

You grab menus at the front, seat yourself, serve yourself water from the water containers or grab a soda from the fridge and patiently wait for the staff to come around to take your order. You have the option of choosing from a variety of hand pulled noodles!! I'd suggest just sticking with the noodle soups or pan fried noodles. Everything else is overpriced Chinese food ($16 for sesame chicken that you can get for $8 in any other neighborhood). The soup dumplings tasted like they were frozen, pre-made and then warmed up. I suggest the pan fried fat HP ND noodles with shrimp. That dish has the most flavor, almost similar to lo-mein. I often find their other noodle and soup dishes to be a bit bland.

Catherine Z.,/user_details?userid=jFODWWzii-4WR67Lzhvujg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11/24/2020,3.0,"Was overall a bit disappointed by this place. I'll start with the pros. The fried shrimp and vegetable dumplings were incredible! Maybe the best dumplings I've had in the city. What makes these dumplings so unique are the skins. They're lightly pan fried so that they're crisp, yet still chewy and almost a little bouncy and not at all greasy. We also got cucumber with beef tendon which was good. The flavors were a good mix of vinegar, soy sauce, and Szechuan spiciness, although I think I would've liked more of each of those flavors. It was a bit overpriced ($16), which I would expect from a nicer place. I actually found the ambiance of the place rather charming; it's definitely a hole in the wall place and when I walked in, there was an older man hand making dumplings. They were also very creative with their outdoor seating, they essentially built these tiny outdoor wooden shacks. Now for the cons. The 2 noodle soups we got (mixed beef noodle soup and roast duck noodle soup) were sorely lacking in flavor. The broth taste rather bland and I truly can't even name any flavors it had. This is such a letdown because I feel like broth is the most important component of Asian noodle soups. The meats were good. Unfortunately they didn't ask us what kind of noodles we wanted and just brought us rice noodles, so we weren't able to try the knife cut noodles. I'm surprised this place gets so much attention for the noodles, maybe I should've tried the pan fried noodles instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We had a hard time finding it since it is tucked away, but it was worth the search. This restaurant is completely clean and safe and the food is amazing! We had the chicken soup with dumplings and pan fried pulled noodles with chicken, etc. Delicious!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Ian L.,/user_details?userid=Rv3LSbLHjmyT03UbawplEg,"Del Mar, CA",8/22/2018,4.0,"My daughter and I tracked down this place - wait, actually we were looking for another place that we saw on a Netflix cuisine documentary.  We found that place had closed but this place, also featured in a video program, was right around the corner!  Its a tiny place that lacks in any form of character, and you cannot really see the noodles being pulled, but the nice server makes you feel more welcome than most native New Yorkers.  Oh you want to know about the food?  Well, I left nothing on my plate.  It was yummy, fresh and cheap.  So apart from being packed into a small shop with no AC, its a winner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Walter H.,/user_details?userid=s3nZOnBcdLC6tEsxtk3Sqg,"Kirkland, WA",2/23/2020,4.0,"Ordered roast duck soup. Came with generous amount of savory duck, noodles & veggies (small bok choy or 上海小白菜) in a sumptuous broth. Had it with the 刀削面 dao xiao mian. Served with hot tea. Typical matter-of-fact service; tell them what you want and they'll be glad to oblige, but they don't hover coyingly and refill your water glass unbidden (pitcher of water and pot of tea are on the table). Value so much better than some high concept places, and the taste was perfect.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
