Brianna Y.,/user_details?userid=reLf-qZK35KQM3ygB1jhAQ,"Manhattan, NY",7/2/2022,4.0,"The wagyu beef and sauce pairings were delicious - so succulent and juicy. You just want more of each bite. Whether it was the a5 wagyu beef, the American style wagyu or the pork belly, each bite was well thought out and worth savoring. The one reason this didn't merit 5 stars was the service. I mentioned my egg allergy at the start of the meal, and they highlighted the two dishes that could be an issue. They didn't really offer substitutions - just provided me with the dish sans egg. That was fine - until we got to the dessert, which was ice cream. It was one small scoop, and I ate most of it when the telltale tingling and swelling in my throat started. I asked the server if there was egg in the ice cream and she said yes. Suffice it to say, this was not the best way to end the meal. My husband was upset because this was our anniversary dinner, but fortunately, I was able to throw up my most recent bites. The servers expressed very little concern or remorse. And we paid and left. It's fortunate for them that I don't have a more severe allergy (worst is an upset stomach and hives). They had no way of knowing that, but for the amount you're paying and experience they're aiming to give you, you'd think they'd do a little more on the service side of things, especially when they made an error that could have ruined a celebratory evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shabushabu-mayumon-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Stephanie W.,/user_details?userid=YkmMTGQYKt6CcxT19KAbNQ,"New York, NY",11/1/2020,5.0,"FANCY SHABU SHABU! I came here to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and the meal was phenomenal. We've been wanting to try this place for a while now and I'm so glad we did. So it's a whole course where the chef prepares the meat and food for you and then puts it into your plate so all you have to do is bring it to your mouth. They do it in front of you and you get to watch them swishing the meat into the water. The first piece of rib eye was mouth watering. It melts in your mouth and they cook it at a low temperature so it's not hot when you put it in your mouth but just right. Literally my eyes widened when I had the first piece and I was just craving for more. Every piece was amazing and went above my expectations. They started us off with a cup of sake and then moved into the salmon shiokara which was a little too fermented for my taste and i had 2 pieces of bone in it but after that it was a straight highway of heaven. My favorite piece was the first meat one with the A5 Miyazaki wagyu rib eye and then my second favorite is the washugyu rib eye with the blue cheese, fig sauce, balsamic sauce. This piece was very interesting because the combination worked so well and really left my mouth salivating even afterwards. I left the meal full and so satisfied. Would definitely recommend to try this place out and they do indoor dining so reserve and enjoy being taken care of!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shabushabu-mayumon-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Enrique S.,/user_details?userid=od1yu6CRwvDKQnBZvKprYQ,"Upper West Side, New York, NY",9/15/2021,5.0,"New Yorkers are blessed with the excellence of the beef and service at this quiet and small shabu shabu experience. From the delicate presentation of the 'goods' to the single serve bites of Heaven. What a treat to be served every single mouthful of a shabu shabu meal. I would've called it crazy but I am absolutely enjoying myself as I write this review only halfway through the service. The properly measured out temperature of each beef 'bite' is truly a science worth studying which Mayumon clearly has perfected. The in-between dishes of enoki mushrooms, or mozzarella wonton show the creativity and care that has gone into the preparation of this meal, not to mention the flavorful blue cheese and balsamic Wagyu sauce. My favorite 'unique' item being the Wagyu temaki, a rice roll with seaweed and the best beef. Each bite is calculated and balanced. How does one make a bite last longer? You will find yourself asking this very question as you taste the tender Miyazaki Wagyu melt in your mouth at the perfect temperature of bliss.

Derek L.,/user_details?userid=1ANv3NFewI4BkxOsSNHgiQ,"Bloomington, IN",4/24/2022,1.0,"It was an extremely unpleasant experience. The waitress was very rude and gave incorrect cancellation info compared with what is presented on their website. When we made the reservation via Yelp, there was nothing about full charge for cancellation. We got there late for 18 minutes and we were told if it passed 15 minutes they would not serve any of the appetizers on the menu but we would be charged for the full amounts in a very harsh tone. They also said since we were late, they had the right to charge full and didn't serve at all but they were showing empathy to let us dine in. The truth is I didn't even have any card to hold the reservation, which basically means they couldn't charge me if I cancelled. Also, I checked back their website after dining with them, it was 20 minutes in stead of 15 minutes late that there would be chance they wouldn't serve the appetizers. After 30 minutes, they would charge full for no show. I understand the no show/late policy, but their attitude made me feel I did something extremely wrong and should be punished for it. The food was okay and like most of other comments here OVERPRICED. If you are interested in Wagyu beef, there are lots of options in town with better service and price.

We ordered three 5-piece pierogies - bacon, cheese, potato; sauerkraut and mom's favorite (ricotta), all pan fried. Our favorite was the bacon cheese potato but what really made them was the onions and sour cream - so good!!! The dough was thinner than I'm used to and some of the fillings were coming out when they were served. Overall not my favorite pierogi I've had in the city, but there are some fun flavors that make me want to come back and try more.

These freshly made pockets of deliciousness are consistently flavorful and filling. Stuffed with potatoes, cheese, bacon, jalapenos - all kinds of goodies - they are not particularly healthy but man are they great! As others have indicated, best to opt for the larger portion, more bang for your buck. And while all of the fried orders arrive with sour cream, I recommend you splurge and get yourself BOTH the homemade applesauce as well as Helen's sauce as side dipping options (both are excellent and compliment the pierogies differently). I've been twice, once packed (had to wait over an hour to sit) and once empty (seated immediately). So it seems it's best to just try your luck. Staff was very friendly and accommodating both times. The ambiance is also lovely, very clean. The walls are decorated with maps, photos and historical information and you can actually see into the kitchen and watch the dumplings being crafted.

Babas is ultra vegetarian friendly with 7 of 8 main pierogi dishes being vegetarian friendly. I got the jalepeno cheddar and cheese as well as the spinach feta and they were amazing. Both the boiled and fried versions were ultra flavorful and tasty. The carmalized onion and mushroom toppings are also a must try! The prices are also pretty affordable for NYC and service was ultra fast. For vegans Babas may not be as friendly as I believe only the saurkraut is vegan friendly (you may have to ask to make sure it is not cooked with animal products).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/babas-pierogies-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I got some for an event, and we got one tray each of potato and cheese, spinach and feta, and chocolate. The chocolate came with whipped cream which was awesome, and I really enjoyed the potato and cheese. I like these pierogies because the skin is chewy and the inside is creamy, and it's really tasty. The chocolate one was fried, and since we got it delivered, the skin unfortunately was hard by the time we got it; I'd imagine it's much better if I had it at the restaurant itself. The chocolate one wasn't too sweet either which I appreciated. The potato and cheese was really creamy inside, and it was super tasty, a crowd favorite. The spinach and feta flavor was quite strong, but the balance between the spinach and feta was good. These three trays along with delivery was $130, and each tray had 25 pierogies.

I recommend getting every style fried, and getting apple sauce and sauerkraut as toppings. When dessert rolls around you must order the chocolate 'rogies. The chocolate, which I presume is Nutella oozes out and is delightfully warm. The savory quality of the dough balances out the sweetness of the Nutella. The coolness of the whipped cream pairs perfectly with the warm bundle of joy. I'm sure the blueberry pierogies are just as yummy, but I do not like cooked fruit, so I tend to steer clear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/babas-pierogies-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Eyleen M.,/user_details?userid=BVjqg1Or4ykJCPm4fiHfTg,"Los Angeles, CA",4/28/2017,5.0,"Ah, Pierogies. I only ever had them from a polish friend of mine years ago. One weeknight I happen to have free time in Brooklyn and ended up finding this place on yelp so I decided to give it a try. The place is warm and inviting and has cute photos hanging on the walls, they probably have a story behind them but I had no time to ask. The man who took my order was very welcoming and gave me a few ideas on what to get. I wanted to try as much as I could so I got their jalapeño and potato & cheese pierogies. You could get them boiled or pan fried. Then I went ahead and got the chocolate dessert piergoie. All of them to go. A lady there let me taste her pan fried mac & cheese piergoie and that actually ended up being my favorite! Haha. All of them were amazing and had such a nice buttery taste when you take that first bite and then all that yummy cheesiness follows. The jalapeño came with sour cream, which was bomb. Also the chocolate piergoie I inhaled in 5 seconds, already craving it as I write this. Such friendly staff & even more amazing piergoies. You can even order wine! Highly recommended!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/babas-pierogies-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Service was super friendly and helpful in trying to decide if our pierogi  order should be boiled or fried. We tried the jalepeno, potato & cheese with sautéed onions and bacon toppings, boiled as recommended; schnitzel bites; and golden beet salad. The pierogis were outstanding - light and flavorful, although I didn't get much jalepeno. The schnitzel bites were crunchy and not at all greasy, but I only thought they were okay; my husband loved them. The beet salad was a bit of a let-down. I was hoping it would be crunchy and it wasn't but it was a good vinegary foil to the other dishes. Not sure what took me so long to get to Baba's, but I'll be back soon to try some of the other fillings and the kielbasa sliders the table next to us had.

Growing up on polish food, I'm familiar with the fare. Babas takes the classic pierogi and goes a step further, offering them a bit of a gourmet twist. They offer pierogi boiled or pan fried, in various flavors. I went with the bacon cheddar potato pan fried, and a keibassa platter. It consisted of a nice link of keibassa, some krout, a horseradish dip, and some bread. The pierogi was excellent.  Pan fried, akin to a good chinese dumpling should be, yet stayed soft, tender. Very flavorful. The keibassa was equally tasty, but the accompanying dip and krout were not as bold tasting as I would have liked.. Hearty sausages need big flavor to balance against IMHO. I'll definitely be back, the thought of those dessert blueberry pierogi are lingering in my mind...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/babas-pierogies-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We also got kielbasy sliders and then blueberry pierogi for dessert. All of the pierogies were delicious - although your favorite will depend a lot on whether you like them more boiled of fried. We were disappointed in the onions because we usually chop them up into little squares and fry them to a crisp to be a topping - here it seems they were boiled in strands and I'd tell you to pass on them. The Jalapeno pierogi are absolutely inspired - they had a nice kick without being overwhelming and topping them with bacon brought them to a whole new level. The fattiness of the pork and the kick of the peppers worked really well together. I'm glad to see them experimenting with new fillings and pushing the pierogi forward as a dish. If you've never had pierogies or your baba made them every week you should come out here and try some - you'll be glad you did!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/babas-pierogies-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Paul G.,/user_details?userid=XSb7NAjFedC_kdqcNBQskQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/17/2019,5.0,"These are the best pierogies I've ever had, and it's nice that they have a vegan menu as well.  There is a slight upcharge for getting the pierogies off the vegan menu and I assume that is because it costs more for the vegan sour-cream and such that they need to serve.  I've also tried the boiled and fried styles and while that comes down to personal preference,  I would recommend choosing pan fried. I also recently tried the chocolate dessert pierogies and those are fantastic.  The only thing I find odd about this place (and it's not really a complaint) is why do all the order sizes come in odd numbers?  These are a natural food to share around the table, and it would just be easier split up and share if they came in even numbers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/babas-pierogies-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Michael K.,/user_details?userid=2qsISLKKWhuOb8KEFvzJwA,"Brooklyn, NY",8/22/2015,5.0,"Baba's Pierogies is an exceptional new Gowanus restaurant!  These guys have the Eastern European treat perfected and it's available in a whole slew of great flavors.  I tried the Spinach & Feta last night and was not disappointed.  They made them to order but it did not take long at all: 5 minutes, tops.  The carrot salad actually came out last!  My wife had the only vegan option available, sauerkraut, which she completely devoured.  While she chose to have her's boiled (tossed in butter and chives) I decided to go pan fried.  They seemed to be equally greasy (the boiled ones were drenched in butter), diminishing the health benefit of choosing one over the other.  The carrot salad tasted a lot like the Passover dish charoset, which was a pleasant surprise (gotta love those Eastern European traditions). What I found equally impressive about the establishment was the friendly service by people who you could tell truly cared about your experience at their establishment.  It's also worth mentioning the beautiful, bright decor, overall cleanliness (including a great restroom) and lemon lime water available at the front counter. Top it all off with environmentally friendly table ware and a menu that also features some authentic, non-pierogi items and you have yet another fine Brooklyn establishment you can't miss!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/babas-pierogies-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Then we got the blueberry and the crispy chocolate dessert pierogies. I prefer the blueberry filling, however the fried chocolate pierogie was overall tastier. Some reviews mentioned a long wait for the pierogies, but I didn't really. Maybe the first savory round took a bit longer to get, but still well within normal timing. I assume they are hand rolling each pierogie as it gets ordered. The servers, and the owner (I assume it was him as he had Baba stories!), were all very friendly.

I come from a Slovakian family myself, and these remind me of my Baba's homemade pierogies. My sisters and I each ordered different pierogies. I had the bacon cheddar, while my two sisters had the mac and cheese, and farmers cheese pierogies. They were delicious! The mac and cheese ones were a wonderful twist to such a classic dish. After we ate there, we decided to grab some spinach & feta pierogies for the road, and they were just as good as the ones we had in the restaurant!

Like many of you I have grown up eating pierogies. My grandmother made them and in a heartbeat if you weren't waiting when the pierogies hit the table, you were outta luck. Everyone's grandmother, mother, cousin, uncle made them- and everyone will rave that their grandmother etc made them the best- But no, these pierogies are special! Let's start off with how beautiful the space is! The staff is wonderful and the restaurant is very clean. The decor is simple but thoughtful. The process from walking into the place, getting seated and ordering something that reminds you of a happy place in your heart is special. The classics are undoubtedly what makes me feel like a kid. But hold on, pair with a chicken soup and schnitzel bites and were on another level of life. Don't sleep on the other menu items because everything is fresh and made to order. I have eaten through this entire menu and I must say everytime I have anything at Baba's the consistency never changes. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. When I am eating out, I want quality, and thats exactly what I get each and every time. I spare no expense when dining out, it's a treat after a long day at work.

Was searching for something to eat in the neighborhood, saw this cute looking pierogies cafe. We looked at the menu, saw other customers' orders, and decided we would eat here. The texture of the pierogie skin is soft and has the perfect chewiness. We had spinach and feta, and farmer's cheese and potatoes. They taste homemade. That is because they make your pierogies to order. One pan fried, one boiled with mushroom toppings. Delicious and satisfying. We also ordered kielbasa with homemade sauerkraut. The platter is on the small side for the price comparing to other items on the menu. But we really love the place and want to support small business like Baba's. Good and affordable dining is disappearing in New York. We need more places like Baba's. The owner really wants to share their food with us and they are proud of their culture.

The meats were grilled table-side and all tasted high-quality, and were well seasoned. We ended off with their bingsoo- shaved ice with red bean. The entrée was $64 a person and I think this was a great value for all it came with. My paloma cocktail was pretty but did not taste that great... but it was also the only drink I ordered. I'd still give ATTI a 5/5 as all the meats and sides were perfect, along with the vibe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/atti-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Mandy C.,/user_details?userid=P6w7dWa9nwzzEeHg70mqfA,"Brooklyn, NY",10/14/2022,4.0,Yay for a fine dining KBBQ place in downtown Brooklyn!! Went with a group of 4. The meats were mostly really good - we got the premium menu as well as the other two cuts that didn't come with the menu so that we could try all the different cuts. I would recommend all of them aside from the filet mignon which was too lean. They have someone grilling it for you so you don't need to do it yourself but make sure you tell them how you like the meats cus the person who did ours kinda overcooked some of the meats until we told him. It was kinda expensive - they don't give you free vegetables (ssam and scallion salad) like all other kbbq places I know. Each was 8 dollars for a few leaves which is pretty crazy. Can we just bring our own vegetables?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/atti-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nicholas G.,/user_details?userid=fExL6u06xTSg13k945IPAQ,"Hoboken, NJ",1/22/2023,2.0,Very disappointed with my experience compared to the reviews. I thought it would be much better. The spring rolls were oily and not fried properly. The soup dumplings were ok. The pork chive dumplings were the only items that were good. The fried noodles were also nicely done and had good texture. The dumplings were not the best. The vegetable ones also didn't hit the spot. They stuck together and ripped apart. I felt bloated and heavy after eating the food.

It's a cute little restaurant and I love how you can order your food at a kiosk on an iPad. Right above your head they have pictures of each item to make ordering easier! After getting off the train, we wanted to get a light meal to eat. Once we placed our order at the kiosk, you had to walk up to the front register and pay. We decided to dine in and they immediately asked for our Covid vaccination cards. I love the extra safety precautions they are taking. Each table was clean and had hand sanitizer bottles at each one. This was my first time ever having dim sum. The barbecue pork buns we're full of flavor and meat. The buns were so soft, warm, and fluffy. The crispy shrimp rolls were amazing and I'm mad I didn't go back for more! It was packed with shrimp and each bite had an amazing crunch to it!

My favorites were the more modern dim sum items which were the fried shrimp roll and the steamed dragon roll. They were interesting and not found in traditional dim sum places.

I ordered the Sui Mai, Pan-Fried Dumplings, Scallion Pancake, Sesame Balls, and Har Gow. Everything was fresh and flavorful. I prefer this over the carts. Some might disagree and say the carts are part of the experience. I get it but if you're a seasoned dim sum goer or you're an amateur, this is kind of ideal. You order after scanning QR Code on the table and selecting the food you want. Don't forget to order your sauces (soy sauce and hot chili oil). After you've placed your order, you immediately get a message with the exact time your food will be ready. No more wondering if the carts will ever come your way or if they've run out of your favorite item. I love the use of technology for efficiency! It's all about setting expectations. They brought our food and everything was delicious. Not one item disappointed me. And they were running a special! If you paid by Venmo or PayPal, you got 50% off your bill, up to a max of $10. I wasn't expecting that. I would definitely recommend and obviously come back. And I love the decor. Raving fan of Awesum Dim Sum. Love the play on words too.

When I looked at the menu the 7 dollar plates had what looked like 2 or 3 small appetizers on each plate.

Amy L.,/user_details?userid=EL4_B24yCNe25ImfhiJxWQ,"Manhattan, NY",7/26/2020,5.0,Wow.  I have been waiting for a good dim sum place by us for so long and it has finally arrived.  It's as authentic as you can get outside of Chinatown.  They make their steamed shrimp rice noodles from scratch (it's not the frozen pre-heat nonsense).  Their sticky rice wrap actually has a salted egg and not the fatty pork that some other places have and their bake bbq pork bun rivals that of Tim ho wan.  I tried their vegetarian dumplings which were done really well too.  Overall I am super excited they opened up down the street.  Please go and try this place out if you like dim sum!  I would be sad if they closed down (like many of their predecessors using this space).  This will be my go to place for now as I haven't been going to Chinatown as much.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/awesum-dimsum-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

A new restaurant opened just as NYC is starting to reopen?!?! That takes courage! Well, that's not the only admirable thing about this cute little fast dim sum place. The owner is so gracious and offered us complimentary iced tea and chatted with us while we waited for our take out order. Then, when he brought out our bag, he told us he'd added a complimentary crispy shrimp roll order so we could try it and let him know what we thought. (It was indeed awe sum.) We used to live in Flushing, so we know our dim sum. This was some of the freshest, most authentic we have had. I want  all of you who live near by to run there and get your takeout because these folks deserve a fighting chance during these troubled times.

But this place is ridiculously good. Everything is so fresh and the variety is amazing! They have dim sum dishes that you won't find at your regular dim sum restaurant. Ex. Lobster Shuimai! If I had another stomach I would try everything in the menu to be honest. The workers here so are friendly and welcoming - gives me warm family vibes I love it! The interior is also very aesthetically pleasing and minimalistic. NYC currently doesn't allow indoor dining but they do have a few tables and chair outside- very very limited! I just took it to got and ate in the car- still taste very warm and yummy! I'm super glad that this is located near Baruch where there's a good amount of Asian American students.

The inside has some really cool decor (alc bottles lining the inside), and there's 2 floors. Personally I think sitting on the top floor is a little nicer since there's more room and spread out. you must try one of their drinks (get the basil one) they're so good and you can't even taste the alcohol. so a bit dangerous. As far as food goes, the rainbow roll is excellent and this is coming from a former sushi hater. The creamy udon is also very popular and can't go wrong with some of their skewers (they recommend like 4-5 per person). great spot for dinner!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nonono-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Highlight of the experience was the water droplet cake, it's so fun to eat and comes with a delicious sweet sauce and soybean powder, very light dessert and perfect way to balance out the heavier ramen they have here. Loved the skewers and the sauces they paired with each one. Only thing is that the ramen is a bit salty and I personally wish there was more broth but overall super delicious and cant wait to come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nonono-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's quite spacious, has warm lighting with a lot of windows. Service is good and frequent. Mostly I thought the food was all around great - everything we tried was umami. My absolute favorite is the tori live pâté- it comes with ginger on the side and you must try the pâté with ginger as it brings out an entirely different flavor dimension! I also enjoyed the salmon salad - salmon was melt in your mouth and salad tasted fresh, as well as the mushrooms. I didn't love the cod roe udon as much, and I've had similar dishes at other Japanese restaurants that were executed better. Overall I had a 9/10 experience here and highly recommend if you're ever in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nonono-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Diane K.,/user_details?userid=LYlLET2ddXtJKAhCwTEGWw,"New York, NY",1/12/2023,2.0,"Flavors were all just okay. Chicken breast was dry, pork with shio was dry. Shishito peppers were doused in this sweet sauce that was overpowering. Nanchatte steak looked sad and nothing like the photo in the menu, but tasted alright. It was almost like they gave us whatever leftover pieces they had, all cut up into bite sized pieces to make the dish look fuller. Really, none of the yakitori was memorable except for the chicken meatball and the short rib with onion. Even the karaage didn't have much flavor, but it was really crispy. For a yakitori restaurant, the only things I really enjoyed was the sashimi/seafood. Service was very attentive, but they forgot to put in  3 items of our order. I'd come back for the sashimi and maybe try some of the hot entree items next time, but would skip most of the yakitori.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nonono-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

In the mood for Japanese and found this interestingly named restaurant.  It's a Japanese tapas style dining. Decor is reminiscent of small industrial Japanese town, cozy, I liked the 2nd floor setup. The food was very good. Nice riffs of standard dishes.  Had the yakitori, excellently grilled and seasoned.  Ramen was on point (get the extra noodles if your really hungry). The oden was a bit bland, it's a mix of fish cake, sausage and veggies in broth. The Kara age was flavorful and crispy without being oily. Soba meshi also satisfied my carb cravings.  Wanted to try the desserts but was too full, next time.

I love noodle dishes with a creamy seafood sauce and this dish was no exception. The Cream Curry Udon seemed to be one of the favorites among the group as well. I also liked the Kani Fried Rice. We also got the Tori Tantan Ramen, Shoyu Chintan Ramen, and Rainbow Roll which were pretty good too.

They were grilled in an open space downstairs behind the counter and I was pleasantly surprised that I did not smell like the grill when we left, granted we were not seated at the counter.

The atmosphere is very casual and classic. It is relatively old building, but the atmosphere gives cozy, home sensation somehow.

The udon was a bit bland and the egg was not poached so I would skip it.  Service was friendly but slow, maybe they were short staffed.  I would come back and probably just stick to the yakitori.  The teba gyoza (pork dumpling stuffed chicken wings) look good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nonono-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

As an adventurous eater I enjoyed the chicken heart, gizzard, the breast was juicy and tender, short rib nice and meaty and the pork belly was melt in your mouth good.

They have lots of wrap around outdoor seating which makes getting a reservation here not bad at all. I still wouldn't recommend walking in. It may be a little overwhelming at first because there's a lot of stuff on the menu and because it's small plates you have to order a lot. We got an assortment of the Yakitori and highly recommend the short rib - it's literally the best thing I've ever had.

Highly suggest to make a reservations because many people do and it's already almost full and super busy the most they open at 12pm. Professional and friendly staffs, clean restaurant with beautiful interior, and food tastes good. The yuzu mimosa was nice, I personally wish it was a bit stronger but it's not too sweet and I really like the pulps they added in there. Ramen is nice and light on the stomach but still pretty flavourful. Fresh ingredients and pretty good quality. The sashimi was nice and really enjoyed the chawanmushi.

Thought it was generally not bad but I didn't love it either. The Yuzu Sorbet dessert was really bomb and my favorite item. Also liked the Suishingen Jelly, although it's pretty similar to the one at Cha-An. I ordered the Yakitori-don which was a variety of 3 different chicken skewers + what tasted like steamed shishito peppers. They were very lightly seasoned, and I liked the weird chicken ground mix one the most - the chicken thigh was juicy but I would have appreciated more seasoning. I also tried a bit of the tantan noodle which was good but was on the opposite spectrum of being pretty strong in taste (fairly salty and not the clear brothy type) - great for a few bites but might be a bit much if you're not sharing. The Galbi skewers were okay, wouldn't order it again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nonono-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

(which I would highly recommend bc it was quite packed when I went - around 7:30pm on a saturday) although they might be known for their yakitori skewers, their seafood items were what I enjoyed the most. the chawanmushi was a highlight for me as it was a nice warm bowl of crab, fish cakes, and shrimp in a  savory egg custard with uni and salmon roe on top. honorable mentions include: salmon tataki and nori tofu (which was surprisingly quite filling). their nori paste is out of this world!! the scallop uni carpaccio was light & refreshing but the basil sauce threw me off a bit. the salmon bruschetta roll seemed very interesting but the thick block of cream cheese + basil sauce didn't sit right w me. last but not least, their cocktails!!

The portions were perfect and we ordered lots of items! We started off with the corn, crunchy cucumber, tofu, and the strawberry salad. All of this items were amazing. I wish the strawberry salad had fresh strawberries instead of dried strawberries. But nonetheless, it was amazing. We got the chicken yakatori with scallions, very tender and flavorful. The ambiance was soft and quiet. Light chatter from the other tables, soft lighting, and just a small and cozy place. The bathrooms were located upstairs and had a sliding door , a little inconvenient. But it was different.

Essentially two lunch sets, and you can substitute the main dish with two other options. Service is quick and nice. We also ordered a dessert that looked amazing and tasted great. Their yakotori set was not too oily or salty, and I certainly enjoyed the seasoning. My friend ordered the ramen (Lunch set A) and it looked equally appetizing.

Hazel P.,/user_details?userid=CSA-YFyZWlxPTeAZRJqMWA,"North York, Canada",5/13/2019,4.0,"This place has a funny name. But the food is delicious even if it's pricey. The food is slightly more pricey than what I would be able to get in my hometown. But then again almost everything is more expensive in New York. I didn't see all of the restaurant since I picked up my food to go. But what I could see looked modern, bright & clean. The first time I went there was a small line up outside the restaurant. Nonono specializes in yakitori. Their yakitori is delicious though small in portion size. Their selection of regular maki is limited but still delicious. The special rolls look good but I didn't try any of them while I was in New York. I'd order here again but I wish they had some more of the more typical bento or combo dishes so I could I try a bit of everything.

It has affordable prices on top of amazing service and the place is also nicely organized and cute to sit at (the bathroom is super cute too) My favorite dish was the egg yolk marinated mackerel sushi roll because the mackerel was so fresh and the egg yolk soy sauce was super delicious and strong (it was only ten bucks!). I really loved their pickled squid dish and corn as side dishes. A must try is the yuzu dessert; I'm so thankful my friend suggested to get this because it ended the night perfectly. 10/10 recommend this place and it's a great date night for two!

My boyfriend and I shared the salmon tataki, kani chowder, duck ankake, curry cream udon, and shoyu tintan. Everything was really good but the salmon tataki and kani chowder stole the show! The salmon tataki was placed on top of a bed of avocado and some kind of sweet soy sauce and garnished with micro greens, it was so fresh and delicious. The kani chowder really hit the spot and was filled with mushrooms and clams topped with a fried soft shell crab. I would highly recommend getting these two when visiting nonono.

Some tapas / appetizers I recommend is the deep fried eggplant, fried chicken and their current special: Tako wasabi. The eggplant was supposed to be deep fried but it didn't taste fried... More like steamed with super flavorful with sweet peanuts toppings. The fried chicken came with 3 drums - wasn't like those typical popcorn chicken you order else where. I really liked their yuzu plum wine cocktail with lemon - came here twice and ordered the same. For the skewers they were all mostly just okay... I didn't like the chicken breast with scallion nor the chicken thigh with cream and truffle...(too overwhelming). I think my favorite one remains the beef tongue.

It is definitely a more contemporary Japanese restaurant with some hipster feel to it. We ordered Basil and Daikon drink (each $12), both of them are pretty light and sweet. We also ordered scallop ($6), lime cilantro ($4.50), eel ($6), and tomato salmon ($4.50) yakitori. All of them are above average but I do think they are a bit overcooked and portions are too small. In addition, we ordered salmon tataki ($11), nonono karaage (4pcs for $12), ika yaki ($10), saba oni on roll ($10), and creamy curry udon ($13). My personal favorites are the salmon tataki with guacamole (and yes, at first I thought it was wasabi too) because it is freshly served on a cold plate and the nonono karaage because it was very crispy with flavor. Creamy curry udon is pretty strong and thick in flavor and definitely would recommend sharing this. HH (beers) are from 5-7pm.

They specialize in skewers which range from ~$3-$6, depending on the type you want. I highly recommend the chicken cartilage one, as it has a very crunchy texture and well-balanced flavor. For carbs, I'd recommend getting the creme udon - it's beef curry udon with cream on top basically.

We also had the sushi tacos, shrimp with cucumber sauce, squid stuffed with sushi rice and the beef tataki with shredded cheese. Nonono also has a great yakitori menu and the prices are so affordable too! I also tried the chicken yakitori with truffle cream sauce. Delicious! Again, tapas fans, definitely try this place.

This place would be really great for a girls' night out dinner or a casual, cute date night. We started out with two cocktails - the basil strawberry and radish yuzu. Both were very fruity yet not overpoweringly sweet. We tried a variety of different appetizers, skewers, mains and desserts but the stand out dishes were the nasu dengaku (deep fried eggplant) appetizer, chicken oyster/meatball/short rib with onion skewers, scallop uni carpaccio, dragon ball (grilled beef with tofu sauce and quail eggs), uni chawanmushi, and kuro goma (black sesame panna cotta with black sesame ice cream and biscuit).

Reserved through yelp and was seated as soon as we arrived. I think I had high expectations for nonono but was kind of let down. I really enjoyed the ambiance because I typically enjoy trendy tapa restaurants but nothing really stood out to me. We ordered the beef tataki, 2 orders of the kani cream croquette (which came with 2/order for $10... $5/croquette wtf), a couple of yakitori, 2 special rolls and 2 bowls of ramen, all to share. No one enjoyed the beef tataki because the meat was so tough and the yakitori was ok. Honestly, my favorites were probably the croquette and ramen, but I wouldn't order the croquettes again because they're so overpriced.. The shoyu paitan ramen broth was really rich and creamy. The extensive menu is probably why we didn't enjoy nonono as much because we weren't very sure what the signature or special dishes were- not sure if I would return but there's so much more to try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nonono-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The standouts have been the yakitori skewers (chicken thigh, chicken oyster, and skirt meat with shishito peppers), the salmon tataki with avocado, the corn, and the soba meshi.

Kelly C.,/user_details?userid=rqJNlnctlWjOL9JLIFQCWA,"New York, NY",11/25/2018,4.0,"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and we loved it! We were starving and wanted to try as much as possible so we ordered a bunch of the small plates. Our favorite was the salmon tataki (it was so good we ordered 2 orders) because of how fresh the salmon was and also because the avocado sauce paired so well with it. I think our second favorite were the daichi mushrooms with the scallop basil sauce; the sauce was so creamy and flavorful. The skewers were grilled and you could tell marinated right. The tens gyoza was different and I loved them. I liked that the chicken wing didn't have a ton of flavor in itself but the pork dumpling meat did, great pair! Everything else we ordered was delicious as well (see photos). I found the salmon belly a little too fatty and wasn't a huge fan of the ground radish; I don't think ground was the right way to go because of how soft and fatty the salmon was...too much of a purée texture for me. I would love to come back to try their noodle dishes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nonono-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We started with skewers, which we thoroughly enjoyed : chicken breast, chicken skin, bacon & egg, shiitake mushroom, and potato with truffle sauce. Then we decided to order several appetizers. I'll mainly highlight my favorites of the night. (1) The ebiwasa (wasabi sweet shrimp) was great, but since the dish only comes with 3, I was craving for more. Make sure you ask for the fried heads, they pack an insane amount of flavor. (2) The uni scallop carpaccio was lovely. A great balance of savory from the sauce/nori + sweet from the uni and hotate, and the shisho garnish was the icing on the cake. (3) The uni cream soba was a cold dish that was surprisingly nice. I typically don't eat too much soba, as I prefer more flavor in my noodles.

Order: the beet cocktail, the corn (I know, just do it), mushrooms, fried rice and the karaage... and probably most other things.

Not gonna lie the chicken tail tastes pretty bomb(I never had fried butter but if you tell me what I am eating is not chicken but fried butter I would believe you) but the rest of the stuff tasted very bland (stuffed squid: soggy rice flavored with sugary squid water, stuffed wings: the only seasoning I could taste is the overwhelming ginger and a bit of sugary taste on the wings, and the seared salmon is proper but I have had better). 5 stars for the interior design with something extra for the dining experience, super cute menus and bathrooms!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nonono-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sylvia L.,/user_details?userid=p2qsU49DvbMrcG_nlejnuA,"Brooklyn, NY",4/1/2019,4.0,This is a modern izakaya that serves solid Izakaya fare. Came here twice for dinner. Food has always been on point and drinks are decent. Yakitori is grilled well. Nothing is burnt and everything is relatively tasty. They have some creative things that we liked and some more traditional offerings that are good. The tsukune and nonkotsu are one of my fave. The grilled corn was also really good. The mushroom caps were tasty. Wings were grilled well. My least fave was the noodles. But then again I'm not a huge carb person. Service was friendly and accommodating. Seating is definitely more comfortable here than at a real traditional Izakaya. Didn't try any of the cocktails so can't speak to that but did have a glass of white wine on my last visit. The place filled up pretty quickly and was busy throughout the evening so go early have ressies. Prices are higher than traditional izakayas but this is a bit more upscale so I don't mind.

Came here on a Friday night for date night around 6:30 and were seated right away; however, must note that on our way out around 7 something there was a large line. So come early! This place has a really organic feel and so does the food. We really didn't know what to get so we ordered a lot of small plates randomly. First off was the salmon tataki- so yummy and very tender. You get a lot of salmon which was unexpected! The salmon is on a bed of avocado and has great sauce pairing up with it. Not going to lie I almost was full trying to finish that off. We also ordered the uni carpaccio (on little scallops). I'm not a huge fan of seawater tasting things but this was really fresh and didn't have any sea smell or taste! Also comes with a lot. We ordered one skewer of chicken liver which was good but not super seasoned. For healthy veggie options we ordered the mushroom plate (Kinoko) which were beautifully grilled in its super natural state, so they basically don't have taste, BUT there is a small dish of seasoned enoki mushrooms which you should grab a little bit of and eat it with the rest of the mushrooms. Tebasaki Gyoza- super juicy, but it's not crispy since it's not fried (like Koreans). These only have pork stuffings. I ordered the creamy curry udon solely for the novelty of it since I've seen it before. The mashed potato cream on top is not thick mashed potato cream. If you mix it with the curry it'll simply disappear. The curry udon itself has a lot of sauce and no meat/veggies in it. It has a good curry kick to it. Only eat this as a shareable carbohydrate, not as a one person meal. In fact forgot to say, share everything. Sui shingen/ water cake is good and simple, and also the black sesame panna cotta.

Wonju R.,/user_details?userid=8ghlDOGFXTxTwLyKbTikAQ,"Dallas, TX",1/3/2019,4.0,"Came here for dinner with friends while visiting New York. There was not a wait when we arrived later in the evening. I was wowed by the variety in their menu - though sometimes that can be a bad thing, as I am bad with making decisions especially on food. I got to try a variety (sashimi, thin pork belly, eel, etc) and had a good meal. The only thing that got me a bit peeved was that the waiters/waitresses don't seem to be communicating with each other. We told one waitress that we needed a few more minutes to decide on the menu, and another comes within half a minute, demanding us to order. In addition, once we paid, they wanted to swiftly kick us out so that they can prepare the table for a larger group. I was not very happy with that.

We were interested in the ika meshi (squid stuffed with rice) but when we tried to order that, the waiter warned us about the fishy and chewy texture a few times. He kept telling us how he explained and warned customers about it ahead of time but still ended up getting complains... we were a bit worried at first but did end up ordering it. We understand what he was trying to tell us the moment we bite into the squid, it taste nothing like a typical grilled squid or calamari, it was not horrible but I won't order it again. The rest of the food was okay without any big surprises. I like the Saturday's roll and pork yakitori with ponzu sauce. The stuffings inside the teba gyoza was a bit bland. My friend likes the Dragon ball dish but I find it a bit too salty when we are having that without any rice or noodles. Overall, food was alright but nothing memorable.

The restaurant is rustic in a trendy way and is good for a casual dinner or something slightly more special. They have a wide variety of skewers, small/to-share plates, and medium/large dishes. Of the skewers, the chicken tail is super juicy and tender and my personal favorite. The short rib with onions and chicken skin skewers get a shout out as well. For small/to-share plates, the scallop uni carpaccio and sweet shrimp are delicious. The grilled salmon, squid, and gyoza are also solid.

The vibe was young and hip, and the food was delicious! They have choices for everyone, adventurous or not. We ordered some skewers (chicken oyster, chicken thigh with yuzu kosho seaweed, beef tongue, chicken meatball, chicken gizzard), potato salad, the scallop and uni crudo, the beef tongue stew, marinated rice stuffed squid, and chicken wing gyoza--yeah, we eat a lot  most people around us ordered about half of what we did. Anyway, everything was so good! But our favorites were the beef tongue skewer (so flavorful and so tender!), and the chicken wing gyoza (stuffed wings are always so delish).

I had a 5:30 dinner reservation, so it isn't like they made all of the items that evening. Then, I had ordered several sticks of yakitori and I ordered each meat in pairs. One of the pairs I ordered, the waiter told me that they only had enough to make one stick and I had to replace the 2nd item with another meat. I had wanted two of the same thing so my friend and I could taste the same items. I told him I'd like to replace that pair and he said he couldn't because he already put the order in. Like...okay.

That made me easy to decide what to get. Ordered some yakitori along with ramen and other side dishes. Generally everything was nice, for me, the ramen and the side dish of tomato with soy sauce was amazing. Those two are the must try besides yakitori. Finally desserts. We got water drop mochi?(sorry i forgot what its called) and yuzu sorbet. I think the water drop dessert is worth trying, but I liked the sorbet better.

I had the cucumber cocktail (bf had a beer) and we ordered pork (no. 5), short rib (no. 1), squid with butter sauce (amaaaazing), noodle and rice dish with pork and omelet, and the pork ramen. We did not need that ramen but good money couldn't have made me stay away from it. We also ordered a great sesame dessert. I'm in awe.

On Saturday night we arrived and were given one empty table outside. After spending ten minutes to get the waitress attention to order, we were actually kicked out so they could give the table to two white guys with no explanation. Just ""we need this table back"". We were standing there awkwardly. They said they would give us a table soon. But after 15 min they actually gave another empty table to another group of white people. We asked and the waitress just went ""you need to wait"". Given all their customers sitting at that time were white, it made sense what they were trying to do.

Jessica T.,/user_details?userid=ptAVptn3aj78PRm-4tCqYQ,"Manhattan, NY",9/10/2017,5.0,"Thought all the dishes we got here were delicious. We started with a simple cabbage appetizer (lightly salted with some sesame oil / sesame seeds), which was surprisingly good despite its simplicity. Chicken Nanban was amazing - sweetness of chicken (honey?) coupled with tanginess of the sauce was so addictive. We also had the garlic butter fried rice (was super excited for this and it didn't disappoint)- has little mushrooms in it. The fried scallops were good (great if you like scallops but I don't ha) and had a dipping sauce similar to that on the chicken. The tamago omelette was cute but probably my least favorite (though it wasn't intensely flavorful like the other dishes and provided a good break). The potato salad was standard (nice little crunchy bits of bacon? In there that was a nice touch) as was the salmon sashimi (probably will save sashimi for sushi focused spots in future). My favorite of the night though- definitely the Sukiyaki. The beef in that soup was so tender, and the noodles were fun (potato based like japchae but shape reminded me of ramen). I will say service was a little awkward (server wasn't great at answering our questions but more language barrier than rudeness), but ok overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Richard L.,/user_details?userid=CBy5lEdMReAWskQSPMdxvA,"Brooklyn, NY",2/8/2018,4.0,I'm a huge fan of this spot! It's a cozy izakaya with a hole-in-the-wall feel with great food. I loved the signature chicken nanban (fried chicken with a sweet mayo based sauce) the most and the quality of the food was high. The bottle of sake we chose was reasonably priced and service was very attentive! The slight inconvenience was they only accepted cash that night but it was minor since we had enough of it. I would definitely come here again for a low key night.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I wasn't able to catch any names, but I wanted to thank them for trying to tend to our needs. Aside from the service, the food was absolutely delicious.

The place itself is small, good for eating with a friend or a small group of friends.

Deborah Y.,/user_details?userid=Mv32eLnYMpK9amRgJuJZjQ,"New York, NY",6/3/2016,3.0,"My experience here felt like me going home and eating one of my mom's really good home cooked meals and then having to pay her a lot of money for it. The waitor recommended us several dishes: The Addictive Cabbage, the Nanban chicken, and the neopolitan spaghetti. We got all of those as well as the Omelette. The omelette tasted really good but tasted like something I could make at home if I had proper ingredients. I really liked how there was cod roe in it and was slightly spicy. The Addictive cabbage was very okay. It tasted like a bunch of napa cabbage thrown together with sesame oil, sesame seeds, and salt. It wasn't very addictive for me. I LOVED the nanban chicken. It was very juicy and came with a delicious white sauce and a little bit of soy sauce. I also like how it came with a lemon to give the flavor a bit more of a kick. And by the time I got to the Neopolitan Spaghetti I was already too full to enjoy it but I love the egg on top of the pasta. The pasta itself was a  bit too sour and salty. It had too much ketchup to it in my opinion. I wish they made it less salty and a little bit more cheesy.

Sebastian P.,/user_details?userid=bYleolwK1uYYJtYDgNJHRw,"New York, NY",3/25/2019,1.0,"I have been coming here since they opened a few years ago. I visited last week to find out that something in their system changed. They used to be a non tipping restaurant (just like in Japan) supposedly paying their employees more than other places. I think that made for a great experience and prices (I thought) were right. A dinner for two, with at least 3 dishes per person, and a couple drinks usually came to 100/120. Now they did away with the non tipping thing. We were surprised to find that after we payed with a card there were three lines to leave a tip and add it up. Prices have stayed the same. So there's something weird here. Initially when they switched to non tipping they raised the prices and it made sense. Now, they did away with that but didn't lower their prices. Maybe this was a mistake or something they've added as an optional? I don't know. Not cool. Unless they change this in any way I won't be coming back.

Mackenzie A.,/user_details?userid=Sstm0vTyoge71CiJYsGdEw,"Foxboro, MA",10/11/2020,3.0,"I wanted to like this place, but it ended up being a disappointing experience, overall. We had a larger party and sat on the outdoor patio in the back. The aesthetic was super cute and fun, with beautiful stringed lights and nice patio furniture. We started off, or tried to, with an appetizer of the Crab Fried Rice. It didn't end up coming out until all of the other food did, but it was really good. Everyone enjoyed the fresh crab meat on top, and overall, I wish I had gotten just that as my meal. For the meal itself, myself and several others got the Spicy Pad Thai with Shrimp. Our main compliant here is that the wait staff said they couldn't tone down the spice level whatsoever for some of our friends with more sensitive palates. Additionally, our meals all came out at separate times, which was not great since the meals were all hot, so we couldn't end up eating together as a group. This restaurant is also decently new and don't have their liquor license yet, so it was BYOB, but this wasn't advertised until we sat down. Thankfully we did have some wine from a local winery, and the restaurant provided a wine opener and glasses. Also important to note, the service was very slow. We felt bad as there was only 1 server for all of the outdoor tables, but this led to an overall not great dining experience. I wouldn't return in person, but would consider getting the Crab Fried Rice for take out again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/somtum-der-redhook-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They have a scannable menu and everything looked really good - I really appreciated the detailed photos they included for some of their most popular dishes. I ended up getting the cashew king dish (a type of stir-fry) with tofu & rice and my friend ended up getting the braised short rib udon bowl.

When it arrived I eat the edamame first before opening the drunken noodles. When I open it there was obviously eggs and I figured I can call them and they will just sent me a new one. But that's not what happened. When I called they told me they are closed for lunch and will reopen for dinner at 5pm and to call back then to let them know. An hour I have to wait? If they made the mistake,) They should have made the effort to get the dish to me correctly. So I called grubhub to refund my order for the noodles.

Andrew L.,/user_details?userid=47xrLll3YniB--VvBgRzaw,"New York, NY",4/4/2023,5.0,THEP brings strong and bold flavors of Thailand to the UES. I ordered the Pork Belly Clay Pot and it was seasoned to perfection. The fish sauce they give you with the dish complimented the flavors of the pork so harmoniously. The menu here can be a little daunting but our server that day was so helpful in helping us decide what to eat that day. We sat on the outdoor patio as the weather was lovey that day and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.

It wasn't bad but the rice could def use more seasoning and maybe a bit of heat, and the shrimp honestly didn't taste like it was seasoned.

I'm glad it was an early dinner, because later on during our meal, the restaurant began to quickly fill up. However, there was an equally nicely decorated exterior with enclosed heated seating.

All this experience was after joining the Yelp Wait List and our table was 'supposedly' ready.  I went there tonight with my 2 year old on stroller and 7 year old. It's 49 degrees outside. He made us wait outside in cold for more than 20 mins. He was apparently annoyed that we were not taking outdoor seating. He was least bothered when we asked him if we could wait inside. He did not even offer us to wait in one of their outside heated booths that were mainly empty and the one he was asking us to sit right from the beginning. He was clearly watching us from inside that kids were uncomfortable waiting in cold. We left and went to another nearby restaurant 'Up Thai' which is super awesome and we were glad we took that right decision just in time. Thep Thai: ""Take some lessons from your neighbor competitors. You have a long way to go, and came across arrogant."" By the way, we have been to Up Thai numerous times before and ive rated them in Yelp several times. We just wanted to try this restaurant for a change.

The pandan infused chive dumplings were delicious, it had a coconut milk sauce and very fresh noodles...yum! The pad see ew with veggies was another hit and it's my fav Thai dish.

The crab Rangoons were pretty typical and the pork buns were okay - a bit too chewy. I got the red curry with chicken and it was so good, however, it lacked the spice I usually prefer. Despite that, the flavors were there and the portion was large enough to split into two meals. Everyone else got an array of entrees (drunken noodles, rice, pad Thai) and enjoyed their choices. We went as a group of 5 on a Friday and they had closed the wait list but we were able to get seated within 30 minutes of arriving. Definitely get there early if you have a larger group!

My friends and I (group of 4) arrived at 6pm and were seated right away on a Thursday evening without waiting at all, but normally, reservations are highly recommended as the dinner rush begins shortly after 6:30pm. You can access the menu via the QR code on the table. There are a lot of options for appetizers, rice, noodle, wok dishes, drinks, etc. We got the pineapple shrimp fried rice, park mor, spicy udon, and a seafood veggie entree with thai iced tea and lychee iced tea. All very flavorful and beautifully plated, and totaling about ~$120 (with tips). In regards to the service, I liked how attentive they were but they did kinda rush us by checking on us numerous times throughout the 2 hrs we were there (ie during ordering, cleaning up dishes, taking our cards for payment).

Meera P.,/user_details?userid=nrxgfV-QrMjjvGeqWIISQg,"New York, NY",5/4/2022,4.0,"Stumbled upon this place around 9 pm on a Monday night. It was one of the only places open at that time, so my friend and I went in for dinner. I ordered an Italian wine and was told they were out, so I ended up with a Cabernet instead. My friend ordered the coffee drink, it was not good at all, not sure why it's even on the menu. Our server was kind enough to swap it out for a glass of wine. The food, overall, was good but not extraordinary. We got the spring rolls, pad Thai with vegetables and pad Thai with duck. The spring rolls were very tasty and I enjoyed the sauce that accompanied them. The pad Thai was not bad but not the best. I prefer Up Thai's pad Thai. The decor inside is beautiful, but the seats are so difficult to get in and out of without knocking things off the table due to the plastic barricades put up in between tables. I understand it's for Covid precautions, but they need to be adjusted to be more comfortable. It also makes it harder to communicate with the servers. We sat inside, but they're outdoor seating looks great.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The only reason i give it any stars was because the food was really good. One of our friends was obviously intoxicated and ordered 5 shots. We all said no to the shots and told the waitress no. She heard us and laughed. She still brings the shots. When we tell her we don't want them, she says we can't take them back. We told them we wanted to take the drinks back multiple times and they wouldn't let us. We were pretty upset about that but gave two of them to the birthday girl and two to the girl who ordered them and one was left. Literally none of us wanted shots. They came back with the bill and charged us for drinks we said not to bring. After going back and forth with them, we just had the girl who ordered them pay for the drinks ($80).

We are so glad that our cousins place is so close to this restaurant that I've been wanting to eat at since we were staying in lower Manhattan prior. The ambience and presentation of food is such a vibeeeee. We were seated outside in the patio which is a little claustrophobic but it was a o k.

The chicken satay was a bit on a dry side, it tasted as though the marinade has not seeped fully through the meat. The short rib udon tasted very bland. The shrimp curry was Ok, again, not out of the park. The service was nice.

Joanne L.,/user_details?userid=htJcrxtelar85UYX5OxkIA,"Washington, DC",5/11/2022,5.0,"I've been to many Thai restaurants in NYC and THEP is definitely among the best of them. We arrived at around noon when it just opened and got seated right away. However, the restaurant got pretty packed by the time we left at 1:30 pm. We got the THEP wing for appetizer. The sauce is really good, like a sweet chili with Thai herbs. Most of the wings are cooked well but one of them was a little raw close to the bone. The short rib Massaman curry was my favorite - sweet and tangy with a little spice, not as rich as other curries so easy to eat. The curry sauce came with onions, scallions, sweet potatoes, and peanuts, all of which I loved. The short rib was cooked well and super tender but was a little cold when it came as if it had been sitting out for a bit. The Kee Mao noodles were also good and did come with a lot of veggies. Our server asked if we want spicy (there wasn't a 1-5 level), we said yes, and it was TRULY spicy. We loved it but definitely check with the server if you have a lower tolerance.

The ambiance of the restaurant is very trendy inside and out and instantly catches the eye of any pedestrian. Unfortunately, the way myself and my two other guests were treated upon being served ruined the entire experience. I understand wanting to check up on your table and see if anyone needs anything or if they're ready for order but this was NEXT level. Quite literally every 2 minutes we were asked if we were ready to order. Each time this occurred we apologized and and said we still needed a couple minutes. It got to a point where it was so over the top that we couldn't even have a conversation because of the constant interruptions. It very much felt like we were being rushed in and out of the restaurant. Our food came very quick which was nice but we were in and out of the restaurant in the matter of 25 minutes. The food was good and I'm happy to have seen they have Gluten Free options.

Tala A.,/user_details?userid=xULXjsHMBQ2Xwfd5LfjY8g,"Sacramento, CA",6/13/2021,4.0,"The first stop we made to NYC was at Thep Thai for lunch! Nothing is better than our fave comfort food! Was recommended to check this place out from the Yelp reviews and clearly did not disappoint!  We went for lunch around 2pm, there weren't many people there so we got seated inside where it is so aesthetically inviting and pleasing. Very zen vibes. We ordered the ube dumplings stuffed with peanuts and despite the purple color of the dumplings they were AMAZING!!! We also ordered the coconut water and the passion fruit drink, both super refreshing on a hot, humid NYC day! For our mains we ordered the classic pad Thai with tofu and the pineapple fried rice with tofu. Again presentation was on point! Food came out very fast! Very aesthetically pleasing and clean! Now let's talk flavor, for the pad Thai it was classic however I'm not sure if this sauce was sweeter or if there was an additional ingredient to it, it had a ketchup like aftertaste, which wasn't that bad but sweeter than I expected for my pad Thai. The squeeze of like helped balance the sweetness out but it was a bit sweeter. The pineapple fried rice was beautifully presented, I wish it had a bit more pineapple chunks in it as I was digging through the rice for more bits of it as well as it had more curry like spices that perhaps I am used to. Overall however, I'd come back and order the same dishes and more again. Hence the 4/5 stars. The service is excellent, the food is clean, delicious and aesthetically please as well as the restaurant itself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were able to take our jackets off on a very cold day. The service was prompt & food was great - we had the crab rangoon & curry puffs + special pad thai and garlic shrimp. Everything was tasty and the portions were very large. They also had a great happy hour, and we followed with specialty cocktails during dinner that were delicious too. I can't wait to come back to try more dishes; likely great to come with a small group too since you can share & try a bunch of dishes (trust me everything on the menu looked amazing!)

Although they have only been around a couple years, their popularity has grown rapidly. They have beautiful interior decor as well as a whole corner of outdoor seating which they also decorated nicely. They have an extremely similar menu to the popular thai restaurant down the block. At first I thought there was no way they would keep up with the quality, but I was wrong! The food here is just so good. In the past when I worked nearby, I had ordered the lunch special quite frequently. My favorite lunch special included crispy gyoza and pad thai. I was disappointed though, when I returned to work after the Covid shut down,  sat down at Thep to order my usual lunch special, and they told me they are no longer doing the lunch specials. I had to leave and go down the block to the other thai restaurant to satisfy my thai craving.

After reading a couple of reviews, I was on board... And I'm so glad I took a chance! Today, I ordered the pad Thai with extra vegetables (with a gluten-free option) along with a side of tom kha soup. It was so good! The flavors were on point and the portions were decent. I was able to break it up into two meals for lunch and dinner. I ordered through their website so that I could get the extra 10%-15% off.

If you dine in, you can get an appetizer, soup or salad, a drink, and an entree for $12 ($10 if you do tofu). On a recent visit, I ordered the pad kee mao (drunken noodle) with chicken, an appetizer of fried chicken gyoza, green salad with ginger dressing, and a Thai iced tea, and was very satisfied with lunch. All of the dishes were done well, the portion size was just right, the noodles had a nice heat to them (but not overwhelming), and the salad was so refreshing. In addition to the good food, the space was nicely designed and really bright and open, the air conditioning felt wonderful on a 90+ degree day, and the service was friendly and efficient. I would definitely come back to try more (for lunch or otherwise).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Let me tell youknow, THEP thai definitely falls into the first category! Their appetizers and entrées are all innovative without letting go of the traditional flavors. I would 100% recommend the THEP platter because you get a sample of all the different appetizers they have from crisp spring rolls, to the golden sachets and tbe chicken /shrimp dumplings! All of which are pretty good and wont disappoint. As for entrées, the crab fried rice and the green curry.

When we arrived someone said ""we called in a reservation"" the host said ok and escorted them to the table. *shrugs* so they take reservations? The food is amazing but they really make you feel rushed. Multiple waiters and waitresses arrive to move you along with getting outta there lol. I think they do not have specific tables assigned and they help at any table at any time with the goal of turning the tables over quick. My husband asked for a dessert menu and said ""it's my wife's bday"" the waitress said we do not have anything for bdays lol ... ummmm, WE ASKED FOR A DESSERT MENU not a birthday cake with candles.

My friend was like I wanted that sauce!  You know what I mean, a slight sense of being rushed through dinner. I got the sweet potato pad Thai which was a risk I knew, unfortunately it was WAY too saucy and very sweet for my taste due to sugar in sauce not the potatoes. No veggies at all, Just a little egg and sweet potato. I was very disappointed with this $22 dish. I barely eat any and never finished my leftovers which is unheard of normally for me especially with Thai which I love.  I thought I would fix it at home with veggies and more egg to soak up some of the sauce-never happened. The dish repelled me in fact and ended up in the trash. The fresh rolls were good.  The prices are a little high for the quality.

So why did I give a 3 star.... the restaurant is SMALL and people were standing behind us like sardines in a cab while we were having dinner. I think guest that cannot fit in the restaurant should wait outside, there should be no reason why I'm eating and someone is on my back.

The atmosphere was great, the staff was very friendly (came to check in on our table multiple times), the turn around for food was quick, and we didn't have one complaint. The food was also delicious. I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings, golden sachet, and Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles). The shrimp dumplings and golden sachet were absolutely delicious. If I rated my food experience based off these two items alone, it would be a 5-star. I could literally eat both all day! The drunken noodles were also really good. I guess this is where I get disappointed because all of the reviews RAVED about this. Drunken noodles are my favorite dish and I am just on a long winded hunt to find the restaurant that does it the best. The noodles were a little soft for me and I was wish I had more sauce. I also wish it included a stronger taste of basil and possibly broccoli. The basil that was in the dish had no flavor, it was really dried up and that boost of flavor truly makes a difference for this dish. Now, was it good?  Definitely. But amazing?

We ended up  getting seated within 5 minutes of waiting which I was extremely pleased with. We were greeted, we used the contactless bar code on the table to look at the menu. We used our call button to call and order our food. The waitress was very friendly and even recommended a drink for my wife who is a bourbon drinker. We received our drinks promptly and our food came within 10 to 15 minutes! I have posted pictures of what we ordered. This was my first time trying Pad Thai and I would have it over and over again because it was DELICIOUS!!! The Crab Rangoon was THE BEST AND CREAMIEST I have ever had!!!

Angelina G.,/user_details?userid=G2ecVGWRf-55JcB5swpc3w,"Elmont, NY",12/8/2019,5.0,"Visiting this establishment the first time, our wait was quite long for a Friday night as anyone could imagine. This 2nd time here for us however, Yelp made the waitlist process very easy. We waitlisted ourselves on the app, then checked in with the hostess when we got there, went to Starbucks to get hot chocolates while we waited the estimated 20-30 minutes. I got a text that our table was ready before our drinks could even cool. We get seated and service was as quick as we'd hope it would be. We were starving! We didn't have to look around (except to enjoy the ambiance) for a server, wave our hands around or anything like that to get someone's attention. The drinks were absolutely delicious! Our appetizers came out quickly and were equally as delicious as the drinks. Then the entrees came and the flavor blew our minds for the second time around! They truly know how to put a dish together. I had crispy Long Island duck with panang curry and it came with jasmine rice on the side. The duck was so crispy yet juicy/tender at the same time! It was perfect!!! The portions were great, filling for sure! Leftovers are almost guaranteed in my opinion. My best friend and I were both too full to even browse the dessert menu. I'd like to return here to try every item on the menu, if it was actually possible. I'm looking forward to my next visit for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It gets pretty packed, specially for dinner, recommend making a reservation if not,  the usual wait time is around 15 to 20 minutes. The staff is really nice, friendly and attentive, from the hostess to the waiting staff. The menu is pretty extensive and has a lot of options from vegetarian to all types of protein. The prices are reasonable and pretty large portions as well. Started with the Tom Kha soup and it was delicious, plenty of flavor, lots of lemongrass aroma and flavor and that coconut flavor  mmmm so good. The main course was Siamese Fried Rice with chicken and it was really good.

Rina S.,/user_details?userid=bjN3YK05dgeHQaZACm18ZQ,"Jersey City, NY",7/28/2018,4.0,"I stumbled upon this cozy quaint restaurant one afternoon by accident while strolling on 2nd ave. As Thai restaurants go, this was one of the best I have been to. The service was prompt and the food came out fairly quickly. I had the crab Rangoon wontons as a starter. The contrast of the crap and cream cheese was super yummy. It came with a very delicious dipping sauce. I also had the pineapple fried rice with shrimp. The presentation was amazing! It came in a pineapple shell. My dinner companion had the PLA ABB which is tilapia wrapped in banana leaves and it also had an amazing presentation. The waitress asked him  if he was ok with spicy and he said yes. Boy was he wrong. There was sooo much spice, but the flavors were very good. I took one forkful and instantly regretted making that decision as I do not spicy food at all! If you're not of the faint of heart, that dish is for you. For our drink selections, I had a delicious glass of Thai iced tea, and my companion had a very refreshing cocktail. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to Thai food lovers or even to anyone looking for a great restaurant with delicious food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Keerthi V.,/user_details?userid=svyVKwAJkkbhJjGhnLoBWw,"Washington, DC",6/13/2018,4.0,"Yum Thai food on a chilly NYC evening. I ordered pad thai with soft tofu to go. The pad thai was pretty sweet and had crushed peanuts. It was very good as leftovers. The tofu was a little bland, and the noodles were a little dry. I think pad thai sometimes gets like that when you order to go because the food is hot and sitting in a plastic box so some of the moisture gets out? Not sure if that's a real thing but pad thai always seems to taste a little dry when I get it to go. The restaurant was really tiny and packed with people. We picked up our food on the way home and it was so cool to see the layout of the restaurant and how they fit so many people in one little area. Bae ordered a vegetable medley dish with tofu and really liked his dish. He ate it all in one sitting. He got a really good portion of veggies and he got the red rice with the dish. I had some of his veggies and really liked them. I think I got more food but it was mostly all noodles and some tofu and toppings, carb heavy. I was happy with mine and ended up having leftovers.

The only bad thing I have to say about this place is the drinks and wine. They shouldn't be serving cocktails for $13+ with well liquor, and the bottles of wine are completely overpriced ($15+ over priced!). Grocery store wines at steakhouse prices.

Dia Q.,/user_details?userid=09estwC7eB2DCqaNdiE96g,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",10/14/2018,1.0,"So my friends and I went here to celebrate my best friend's birthday and the servers were being very RACIST, RUDE, AND INAPPROPRIATE.  One of my friends came early and asked for a table for us and the hostess told her to come back with everyone and we will have a table. When we all got there, she told us that it was not a proper reservation and took down her name and number then told us it was a 30 minute wait. So we said ok and took a walk and came back. She proceeded to say that a group was finishing up and it should be another 10 minutes.  10...20...30...40...60...90 minutes later we finally got a table after waiting for so long in the cold. Every server except for one male waiter gave us dirty looks. Now we took into notice that we were the only group of black young women in that entire resturant. The food was ok when we ate, but when it came time for the check they gave us more problems. Now we calculated everyone's part correctly and did the math more than once. They  came back to us four or five times telling us that we underpaid. WE OVER PAID THEM BY $60 AND THEY KEPT GIVING COMPLICATIONS. After we overpaid them, two of my friends went to the bathroom and two of us were sitting at the table. The same rude hostess from before came and asked us to wait at the bar because another group needed the table. By this time we were annoyed because thet were rushing us out after they had us WAITING 90 MINUTES FOR THE TABLE. The part that irritated us was that the other groups in the resturant were doing that and they werent told to move, but we had to move and we havent been there as long as they have. Before the hostess got a reply from us, she grabbed my friend's to go bag from her hand and DROPPED IT ON THE BAR. We went outside because we needed to calm down and when the rest of our group came out we left. MY FRIEND WAS LEFT CRYING BECAUSE HER BIRTHDAY DINNER WAS RUINED AND WE HAD TO SPEND MONEY ON SUCH A RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL ESTABLISHMENT. I also feel that they were taking advantage of us because we were all 17-18 year old college students. I would recomend the food, but the costumer service was so bad that I would not recomend going here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

THEP is my new favorite Thai spot. It's a bit pricey than your average Thai place but the food quality is so much better. In Thailand, we would get pad thai in an egg crepe on the street for $3. At THEP, you pay $26 for pad thai in an egg crepe, though it also comes with squid, gigantic prawns, and green apples. A bit pricey though it is hard to find pad thai in an egg crepe in NYC. The regular pad thai is only about $15 so we will definitely do that in the future. I also had the khao soi which was arguably better than any khao soi I had in Chiang Mai! It was creamy with tons of flavor and noodles were perfectly cooked. I was able to switch out the chicken on the bone for tofu which was fantastic. The tofu was so soft and flavorful in the broth.

Dee R.,/user_details?userid=epYz9sQNOaBQ1Jz9JboqiQ,"Manhattan, NY",10/19/2019,4.0,"This is a very solid choice for Thai food on the upper east. They have all the classic Thai dishes that one expects at a Thai restaurant, but also some special dishes which are not typically finds. We had a shared platter of a sampling of appetizers.  These were mostly fried and two pieces of around 5-6 apps.  This was a great way to taste a variety of things and nice way to start off the meal with drinks.  We got two separate entrees- rice and noddle dishes- both pleasantly served and top notch.  They have an extensive list of cocktails and speciality drinks as well as wine and I think beer.  Service was attentive.  The only drawback I found was that it is very very loud (crowded night although we went early and music too loud ). More mellow background music to not compete with the noise of people would be much better atmosphere.  It was difficult to relax and have a conversation at times. Also it is a bit cramped.

OMG- the green curry was delish. Veggies  thinly sliced and the chicken had large pieces which were juice-not stringy or rubbery. My hubby has the red curry with squid. He's never had the red curry before and he LOVED it. I tried it too and with was a great too. (now I'll have to decided and between red and green when we go out!) All good. Great value. Service nice.

First- the restaurant is decorated very well and I really like the overall vibe. If you've eaten at the previous restaurant you'll notice how many changes they made big and small and its great. The service was very attentive throughout the meal including making sure we had water, asking about needing more drinks and checking on if we liked our dishes. I hope this continues and it isn't just a ""new restaurant"" approach. Its definitely a differentiator. I got the pork buns to start which were great and tasty. For my main I had the chicken goddess (or something liked that).
