The broth was also bland despite being the signature black garlic tonkotsu. I ordered the combo, which comes with Gyoza on the side--also cold:(  When the vendor asked how the ramen is, I replied that it was cold. It appeared that the vendor proceeded to turn up the heat on the broth, but offered no apology or consolation. Also the egg is an add-on ingredient. In my opinion, the egg should be standard.

Chloe Y.,/user_details?userid=JQ6mSr_BfLKU52yf-H3ggA,"New York, NY",8/11/2022,1.0,"Yikes, hard pass. Asked for the signature black garlic ramen and with spicy, which is $1 extra. The guy must've not heard me because he asked me if I'd like it spicy. I said yes. We came well before the lunch hour so it was just me and one other customer. Sorry for the incoming karen moment but the ramen I received was not spicy. You see, this wouldn't be nutty to me if 1) they didn't charge me for it and 2) if there was a better excuse for their mistake like a rush hour. Also, it's quite  hard to justify paying *more than $20* for ramen where the broth was very mild tasting, much less not what you asked for, noodles that weren't anything special, much less not chewy, and all with only two pieces of unremarkable chashu. Also interesting to note mine looked nothing like the image of the signature ramen posted here. What I received only had mushrooms. There was no seaweed, no bamboo shoots, no scallions, no bean sprouts. The egg is an additional charge, so that made sense, but I wonder if receiving each of the above ingredients  would be an additional $1 each (which is especially nutty considering the above are pretty basic ramen staples and the base cost already puts you at $20) or if this placed has experienced completely different management since then. I know this is FiDi and we're all hurting from inflation, but other restaurants here have still managed to provide quality service and food without leaving you feel like you've been robbed. Anyways, this was disappointing to say the least.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/senshi-ramen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The kale salad was really unique, with greek yogurt and orange and anchovies. There's not really vegetarian entrees but it's a special that changes. They made me a risotto with burrata and tomatoes, red onions, and pesto drizzle. It was amazing and a huge portion, so I took the leftovers home put it into an omelette the next morning!

Elena W.,/user_details?userid=YCi2wwoHso00FZPHcHkwtg,"New York, NY",6/18/2021,2.0,"I think this place is overrated. We came here on a weekday night after seeing the immersive Van Gogh exhibit at Pier 36. We were looking for restaurants nearby, and this restaurant showed up on Yelp, so we decided to give it a try. We got outdoor seating and ordered several drinks (spicy margarita and red wine), two appetizers (tartine and soup; we wanted to order oysters but they were not available), an entree (duck), and a dessert (chocolate mousse). I like the cocktail, but the food was just ok. The duck was not tender, and the potatoes weren't cooked well. Even the sauce wasn't tasty. The service was very slow. I'm not sure if they are understaffed. We waited at least twenty minutes to just get the drinks, and another twenty minutes for appetizers. The whole meal took almost two hours. The server never came to check whether everything was ok. She took away the water bottle on our table but didn't come back with a refilled bottle until we asked her. The only time for the quick service was when we asked for check, and the bill came immediately. They do charge a 3% fee if you are paying with credit card. You can also pay cash. They have an ATM inside the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/les-enfants-de-boheme-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I can't say enough wonderful things about this little gem on the Lower East side. The staff were extremely accommodating to my little independent eater and the food was exceptional. Lila and I devoured the piquant tomato and cod chowder, indulged in the artichoke dip, and ate every bit of the curried cauliflower and tabouli. The latter was  the highlight of our meal.

There were only few people at the restaurant. We have to ask the waitress to open the AC for us because we are all sweating... My friends ordered a rose and a lemonade. The lemonade was nothing but tap water with a piece of lemon. No taste at all. We ordered the same thing again thinking the waitress might've gotten us a wrong drink. We also asked what's inside the lemonade, the waitress said it's literally water with lemon and some syrup... at least she is being honest about it. Do not try:( so both of the appetizers we ordered are pretty good ( tartare and egg white bacon toast). There comes the main courses which are the duck and mussels with white wine sauce and it was recommended on the daily special board. The duck was very good, soft and juicy, but when the mussels came, we all smelled something weird, and thinking was probably the fishy smells of the seafood but then when we were eating them, a lot of the mussels were actually spoiled and gone bad. I mean if we can smell something wrong, the chef should've known and shouldn't be serving it to the customers. We didn't take pic of the mussels because it didn't look good anyways.

Our waiter was super on point from getting the air con pumped up to making sure we got all of drinks to making recommendations on food to just overall being awesome. Friendly service without being over the top is definitely appreciated! We ordered beef tartar, the cheese l'orgy (charcuterie plate), foie to start. Beef tartar was super tasty. I could have like five orders of this MYSELF. The foie came in a jar and toasted bread. Yummo! It's like peanut butter and jelly get in my belly good! The cheese board was very good and we enjoyed all the cheeses and meats that came with it. Esp the mild blue. I kept coming back for more. On to entrees. I of course had to have the duck confit. Whenever there is duck confit on a menu you bet your bottomless margarita that yours truly will be having that! Did not regret it ONE BIT. Flawlessly executed.

We both ordered the roasted chicken, which was very well cooked and came with sweet roasted carrots and creamy (almost a little too salty but decadent) mashed potatoes. Got the creme brûlée for desert, perfect caramelized top- creamy and set custard. So why four stars? The place is cash only- but a main dish here runs for at least $20 a pop, meaning that unless you carry a decent amount of cash around with you, you are probably going to have to use their atm which surprise surprise will charge you a fee.

He is very picky when it comes to coffee and has had many cups all over the lower east side (we eat out a lot) but he said this restaurant serves the best coffee in the neighborhood. My inlaws had Croque Madame and they enjoyed their meals very much. We were disappointed that they were not offering pancakes (there is a new chef and the menu will be revised) so we ordered french toast for the kids. The french toast was a bit dry but the fruit served was fresh and crisp. I hope they will be offering crepes (a sweet option and a savory option) for brunch soon. We appreciated that the food came out quickly since our kids are young with short attention spans. We will be back for sure to try their lunch menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/les-enfants-de-boheme-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Especially as a Chinese American recognizing a bunch of cultural references in the drink names, and the unique Chinese ingredients that are mixed into the drinks.

There were ample tables available at 5PM but were seated at the bar since reservations later on. They have nice old apothecary decor going on. Drink menu straight forward. Drinks are about $18. We tried several and they were hit and miss. The bartender was very friendly. The monkey king was my favorite. Smokey rum flavoring tasted great and would get again. The nightingale was very disappointing. Just wasn't tasty enough for high end cocktails in NYC. Last we had a mocktail..so they couldn't do one of their cocktails without alcohol since a lot of their stuff is premixed with alcohol (shouldn't these cocktails be made fresh given their high end price) so the bartender threw some pineapple and other juice together. Tasted super sweet and it was $14 for it. Super disappointing.

I had the bartender make me a drink he likes  and  a lychee martini as well . I like this place a lot.

Natalia S.,/user_details?userid=34K3j9o3bE1t8RFRyOL_Tw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/5/2023,5.0,"I couldn't want to write a review for this place! Talk about chic, quick service and unforgettable pairings; this place was a must return for me! The customer service is incredible, they are very accommodating, polite and fast. We started with drinks, a beautiful presentation, the flavor combination was incredible and the prices, pricey-but what isn't in NYC. I can't remember the name of the drink but it was one of the 'sweet' drink from the asian speciality menu. On the topic of drinks, I loved that from that ""asian speciality menu"", there was an introduction to the drinks. There was meaning behind the flavors, symbolism of the drinks being sweet, spicy and so forth. Very cool! Getting back on track as to why this place is top tier-THE FOOD. I wish I could eat this everyday, however the economy and my bank account won't allow for it. We had gotten the lump crab cake fried rice-Holy Guacamole! It was so good, the people who only ""came for drinks"", were inspired to try it because my fiancé and I couldn't stop saying ""omg, this is so good"". The fried rice was followed my the schezuan dumplings, packed with shrimp and pork, the flavors were a mouth explosion. It is on the spicy side, but not over the top spice; and that's coming from someone who hates spicy food. Last but certainly not least, the garlic prawns-Good lawd! I mean I am just floored by this menu, both drinks and food. It was carefully thought out, precise with the combination of flavors and overall, a great time. The vibe is so smooth, perfect for date night, grabbing drinks or grabbing an app before another reservation. Make a reservation, the fill up quick and this is one place you don't want to miss!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yes-apothecary-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We made a reservation for a table for 4 and table for 5, but wanted to make sure that they can seat us next to each other. They have no phone number so in our resy reservation we asked for our two tables to be next to each other and also emailed the same request, but never heard back only to find out that the two tables were placed on opposite ends of the restaurant when we got there. We proposed several options around shifting tables, but it didn't feel like they were trying to make any effort in accommodating us. Ultimately we couldn't come to a resolution and our party left the restaurant and had to scramble to find a place in LES to fit 9 people on a Saturday night for a birthday party.

Jim R.,/user_details?userid=Wjj4XrByEHHKSGj1urK25w,"Manhattan, NY",4/15/2023,2.0,"I have used Yelp for many years to look at reviews and decide on a restaurant, but never took the time to do a review. It pains me that it took a very negative experience to prompt me to write my first review as I truly enjoyed my first experience to this restaurant. I live one block from the restaurant and dined at Ye's Apothecary in January for my birthday. I had a wonderful time and planned to go back again. The small, intimate dining room was beautiful, the food was incredible (especially the Chili Filet O Fish), and the service good. For this reason, I made another reservation in April. I had some friends visiting had previously lived in Hong Kong and were looking for great Chinese food. I decided to take them to Ye's Apothecary for this reason. When we arrived, we passed the beautiful dining room you see on the website and shown to a table in the very back of the restaurant, meshed between two red curtains (with an elevator panel peeking out of one), and directly next to the wait station. There were no other tables in view, and it is a lonely, isolated place to dine, unless you want to hide your date or friends from the public, then it's perfect, see photo attached. I asked if we could be seated in the main dining room where there were at least 8 other empty tables. The woman said she would check and after a few moments returned and said ""sorry we have other reservations and were booked"". I reminded her that I too had a reservation, and I am standing right here. Why could we not be seated in one of the empty tables and another party arriving later be seated in the table we were shown. She then ""checked"" and returned to say that our only option was this table. I am perplexed at how they are prioritizing their customers that some get the nice tables and others get sent to isolation. I told her that I would rather cancel my reservation and go elsewhere than to dine at this terrible table. The woman simply kept apologizing through a condescending grin. So, we canceled the reservation and went elsewhere and had a wonderful evening. Because of this interaction, I will never dine there again, and it saddens me as it was my favorite local spot to take my friends and the food is very good, but this woman's inflexibility to accommodate a customer when it was obvious she could has taken Ye's Apothecary off my list for good. I write this review simply to be aware that if you are excited to dine in the beautiful dining room, you may be lucky, but diner beware that you may also be seated in a dark, small corner secluded from the ambience and decor that lured you in in the first place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yes-apothecary-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ok so first be on time for your reservation because the clock starts at the time of your reservation not the time you arrive. Secondly it dark and a small place so the tables are close together. You do not need a reservation for the bar and if I were alone; I would say the bar is a perfect place. First the drinks were very good, I had one with a lollipop which I liked a lot. There was another one which I had and it was also really good but the lollipop drink was my favorite. Then we had the beef potstickers which were very good we got two orders. We had the chicken wings which were also very good. We also had the shrimp appetizer and that was very good. Then for the main course we had noodles and shrimp with a side dish of green vegetables. I really enjoyed the food and the service was very good. I would say the bill did add up but I feel we got our monies worth.

Soft and flavorful, I loved the sour kick. My only complaint is I didn't order more. My recommendation, they are rather small, so make sure you order enough or other menu items in addition.

They had a seat for us immediately and there was relatively short wait to receive our food - maybe 10 minutes or so. We got the Pan Fried Pork Buns which had a nice crispy bottom and were slightly juicy on the inside. I thought the Spicy Pork Wontons were very much on the mild side but flavorful enough. Our favorite dish was the Sautéed String Beans as it came with a slightly sweet dark soy sauce mix and very tender. The only disappointment was the dan dan noodles as they lacked flavor. Overall, I loved what they did with the space for a casual and chill dinner - very modern, clean, and spacious especially for New York.

I put the wontons in homemade chicken soup. Siu mais are good to have them for quick steam and snack. I love the rice and pork one. Love that it is not salty so you can add soy sauce! They let me keep the southern vege buns which was mistakenly delivered. I am not a fan of buns because of how little filling they usually have, but this one had pretty full filling inside. I wouldn't mind trying their pork buns in the future. Also a plus that they deliver to Jersey City!!!!! JC food sucks this makes me very happy. Their staff/owner are very kind and caring.

That's was a surprise to me because the food at the other location is already pretty good and they offer a lot more here! My friend and I ordered HK style sautéed crispy pork feet, 3 Times special braised snow beef, Chinese broccoli. I would say the food weren't too greasy at all.

Vicky N.,/user_details?userid=riaYRoGq4lnyquterkVn-A,"Manhattan, NY",2/10/2020,4.0,"Went there during lantern festival for the Ningpo Tangyuan, a glutinous rice ball with sweet stuffings. A little disappointed to see that the LES restaurant didn't have a lot of the entrees on their social media page. I I ordered the crispy croaker rolls instead, its basically fish wrapped in fried bean curd skin. It has a very crispy shell, the fish inside is steamed tender, it almost melts in the tongue. The only thing I dislike is so much oil is used to fry the roll, there was so much oil I could see it dripping. They give a sauce to soak up the oil; which I find in dismay is something like thousand islands sauce, quite thick and tangy, which doesn't help lessen the oily taste of the fried bean curd skin at all. Me recommendation would be to serve it with a sour or spicy sauce in the future?...the Tangyuan were fine, nothing special, I don't think it was handmade, but just be bought from supermarkets instead, but still a decent meal",https://www.yelp.com/biz/3-times-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
