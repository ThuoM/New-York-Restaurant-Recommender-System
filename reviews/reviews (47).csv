Marion P.,/user_details?userid=Yq26k-cmFfnWqOd1IyyPmg,"Yardley, PA",3/25/2023,5.0,Excellent restaurant ! Initially I was intimidated by the menu and I wasn't sure if I would like it but everything was so good! We started with gougeres which was cheesy and delicious. I didn't love the sauce that went with it (friend did). Then we had the cheese soufflé (so soft!) and the beets (my least favorite but still good). I had the salmon en croute which was really excellent. My friends had the risotto and fennel tagliatelle both also really good. We ended with creme brulee and cheesecake excellent. Our server was so nice and helpful. Ambiance was nice as well - I just didn't love that you have to walk through a hotel to go to the bathroom and had a totally different feel.

Samika P.,/user_details?userid=LF1o1iUqc0SbaJcZR5t2jQ,"New York, NY",3/5/2023,4.0,"The entrance of Koloman is a little discrete, but when you walk in, you're greeted by a very stately, sophisticated interior. The service was impeccable - right away, they checked in our coats and took us to our table. The ambiance is slightly ruined by the crowd near the bar area, which didn't match the otherwise chic vibe of the restaurant, and the tables placed really close together. The standout here is definitely the salmon en croute - the perfectly crispy and buttery crust goes so well with the tender salmon and tangy beetroot sauce. The cheese soufflé and the gougeres (mainly bread and cheese with red wine shallots) were also noteworthy, practically melting in your mouth. I was disappointed, however, by the snapper crudo. I wasn't getting much flavor or texture in the dish. And of course, this place is extremely pricey, so the food didn't wow me the way I expected it to. Overall, though, I would recommend checking out this spot to anybody looking for a delicious salmon dish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/koloman-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

For instance, we wouldn't have known that the boeuf was prepared in 3 different ways, but we definitely appreciated the dish's variety of textures. The salmon en croute was also melt-in-your-mouth tender.

David A.,/user_details?userid=xAXjMh_tWvyPS1a957Dk9w,"New York, NY",11/5/2022,4.0,"I enjoyed but did not love Koloman, and this is not an inexpensive restaurant. We split the beets ""linzer"" and the Short Rib Tafelspitz Terrine. Both were very good. The beets were fairly basic, with a bit of linzer crumble strewn in, and some creme fraiche lining the plate. The terrine was a bit more interesting, and the flavors were nice. For mains, my pal got the Schnitzel (I found this a little greasy) and I had the beautiful -- and very tasty --  Salmon En Croute. The Salmon was faultless, but not thrilling. For dessert we split the soufflé with rum and lingonberries, and it was very good, but I was a little disappointed (am I being too picky) that it wasn't served in a soufflé ramekin but a shallow dish. The flavors were there, but the presentation was blah. I would be more disposed to love this place if it wasn't so pricey, but much like Frenchette (which I think is a more interesting and better restaurant) it's not a place I will visit regularly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/koloman-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Celery root tartare, short rib and tafelspitz terrine, roasted duck with oranges, lingonberry soufflé: all superlative. If there was one weak link, it was the schnitzel; very good, but ordinary compared to the fireworks of the other dishes. There were long-ish waits for the first round of drinks, and between appetizer and entree courses; but the service itself was smooth, professional and attentive. The decor is beautiful, too, but the layout of the room is such that some diners will only get a view of a blank wall. Noise level can be very loud, but if you snag a booth or corner banquette, you're buffered somewhat.

Pasta was perfectly cooked Al dente but it was overall on the salty side (and this is coming from me who likes salt). The chanterelles were delightful, wonderful flavor and freshness. We ended sharing a cinnamon gelato and it was surprisingly light and a great finish to the heavy meal.

I have been going to Lupa for nearly 20 years and it has always been one of my favorite Italian restaurants. Tonight, after three years and the pandemic, we returned to find that it is no longer special. It's no longer a restaurant worth traveling more than five blocks in NYC to visit. The service was indifferent. The short rib pasta - long a favorite- was under seasoned and the sauce tasted like it was cooked last minute rather than being a rich braise. The sorbetto was full of ice chunks. We had to ask repeatedly for forks when our utensils were taken away between courses. Another formerly good restaurant is now only mediocre. Just eat at your corner Italian - the welcome will be warmer and the bill more affordable.

Started with a veggie crostini, than had a fettuccini followed by a pork dish. Because it was a special menu, the portions were smaller than normal. I saw many customers sitting nearby happily devouring large bowls of what appeared to be delicious pastas.  While service was very friendly, it was slow.

I have dined there many times through the years, but this experience was so thoroughly disgusting and upsetting I felt I needed to reach out. I was with my family for an early dinner when a dead bug fell from the ceiling onto our table in front of the waiter. She apologized and took the bug away. We then spent the rest of our dinner swatting away bugs from our plates. We ate inside and you have open doors. I know, some will come in, but this was beyond dirty and disgusting. Before we finished our meal a second bug fell from the gross ceiling, this one alive. The buss boy then killed it on our table leaving a blood stain next to my wife. I told the waitress and she proceeds to talk to the manager Gulio. We could not finish eating after that. It was nauseating. The manager never even came to our table to check on us. I paid my bill and left. I was so upset I went to the manager to thank him for not even coming over to check on my family and myself. He was so rude and condescending. He said sure, I'm sorry there are bugs. What do you want me to do. He was being a complete wise guy. I will never come back to any restaurant you own again Mr.Bastianich. You need to know that your restaurant is dirty, full of bugs and your manager is a disgrace. It would be beneficial for you to rectify this as soon as possible.

We had the Brussels sprouts and arancini to start, both were really delicious. Then came the pasta. Oh my, my rigatoni was not edible. Not only was it salty but it was way underdone (not al dente, it was basically raw). I hated to have to send it back but I had to. The new plate served was saltier than the last. In the end I didn't eat it. My fiancé had the bucatini, it was salty but edible and cooked Al dente. The service was lovely, our waitress was great. Maybe the chef has lost his sense of taste? I don't know.

Tony J.,/user_details?userid=Adi6YcruzP0QDHhoPrUuNg,"New York, NY",7/11/2021,3.0,"Hopping! We had reservations for a late seating on a rainy Saturday night and the place was filled. Service was quick and attentive. She started with a couple of delicious cocktails (An Italian Mule and Aperol Spritz. Both delicious, not too sweet. Can't say that about the Manhattan that followed, tho!)  it tasted like a liquid cough syrup. Waaay too heavy on the cherry syrup. The buratta and Baccala Salad were both strong.  Very flavor and perfect blend of flavors.  The cod is salted in house and was tender, large chunks and served cold.  Buratta was velvety and a perfect consistency for the matched peas toasted peppers and vegetables that accompanied it.  We had two pastas, the linguine with clam sauce and a black (squid ink) penne with seafood. Both were excellent but a bit on the salty side.  The pastas were very fresh and tasty, high quality.   The dishes are meant to be eaten w pieces of everything the chef puts inside because the flavors blend and support each other.  By the time our Branzini main and garlic-and-farro side arrived was totally stuffed. But the fish is filleted w the head and tail on laid on a bed of sauce and asparagus. It was tasty. The faro was lacking in flavor but again when blended w the fish it added texture and gained support, but could do without it.  Overall, good meal and great ambiance for a Saturday night out. Probably overpriced for the misses on some of the dishes. I think if I returned would go for bar for drinks and just try out their pastas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/lupa-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Joyce K.,/user_details?userid=xrQZA0GbA-I3U7M-8rR5LA,"Rutherford, NJ",7/22/2021,1.0,Disappointed.  Service was ok and the food was underwhelming.  Hummus crostini was unseasoned. Plain chick pea paste.  Focaccia was like cake and not very savory. The chicken liver crostino was too salty. Asparagus was good.  The crispy pork belly and pork chop special was bland and a little dry despite all the fat.  It should've been served with a sauce and some kind of garnish. Ordered the ricotta gnocchi which was supposed to be very good but there was barely any sausage noticeable in the purée and tasted like Ragu spaghetti sauce.  We decided to skip dessert there and walked over to Morgensteins for ice cream to end the evening on a sweet note.  I was so excited to try Lupa because their Instagram looks great but I would not recommend it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lupa-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Amazing service from friendly staffs that are willing to answer any question to professional staffs that know what they are doing. The know their wine and pair it really well. Another staff cleaned off the crumbs from the table and was very attentive and polite. Another staff was so attentive that after a few dishes he realized that my mom and I are sharing everything so the when we ordered the second round, he automatically asked the kitchen to separate one order to two different plates for us even though we didn't ask. The cocktails were good, not watered down and Toltec Money Tree is a pretty unique cocktail that's really awesome. Their meat and seafood dishes (appetizers and entree) are all very tasty but they are the best when it comes to their pastas. You will absolutely regret it I'd you don't order them. The bread is really soft and nice too, and the olive oil is fresh. The coffee is good and dessert was just perfect. I'd definitely go back again and highly recommend this place! I'm also definitely bringing my entire family here when they visit me next time. Nice atmosphere and some noise but not loud. Pretty relaxing and cute interior. Restroom is at the back and decently clean, the only thing is that the lights are so dim I could barely see. I had to turn my phone's flashlight on to retouch my makeup after. Walkable to a couple different subway stations and not hard to find. I do suggest people to make reservations though, as they do get busy. I also love the Capitoline Wolf as their logo and the mini sculptures as their decorations.

We also got frito misto with calmari and artichokes, and unfortunately artichokes weren't very ""meaty"" and consisted mostly of deep-fried leaves.

They have an amazing, extensive wine list. You start with fresh rosemary bread, as well as crostini with fava bean spread (my favorite). We ordered the crispy squash blossoms, they were phenomenal. My dad got the crispy cod; the tomato wasn't as spicy as the menu described, but it didn't have to be- the dish was delicious. My mom got the Bolognese special of the night and thought it was yummy. I went for the classic Cacio e Pepe- I thought it was very good, but be warned if you're not great with pepper, there's definitely a good amount of it in this dish. The only thing that wasn't our favorite was the side of corn risotto (I don't recall the exact name). It was pretty good, but just seemed to be lacking some spice of some sort.

David H.,/user_details?userid=LdCS_h4p0hnMGBDmg3gSlQ,"New York, NY",12/27/2021,5.0,"Lupa is a little jewel of an Italian restaurant here in NYC. Here you'll find authentic Italian cooking with a menu that you'll be asking the waiter to explain to you but don't be intimidated. This is good, simple, wholesome cooking that will warm your belly and your heart. This review, however, is not about the food. It's about the service. Too often customers use Yelp as a weapon. They bitch about the food, the service, or both. My friends and I had reservations at 5pm on December  26th, the day after Christmas. Niceties aside, no one wants to work the day after Christmas but in the hospitality industry most people have to. It's gut wrenching for workers but ignored by entitled people the world over. That's why when we sat at our table (as always but especially at this time) I made it a point to be friendly and genuinely grateful for the privilege before us. Our server, Michael, a comedian from L.A., was friendly and knowledgeable. His service was flawless. So was the wine recommendation from David the sommelier who steered us towards a cab blend from the Lozzo region of Italy. It was delicious. In short, be kind, respectful, and leave your server a big tip. Seriously. Living is hard and rent is unaffordable for those in the hospitality industry. Covid has only made things worse. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, David, and thanks to everyone at Lupa for making our night special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/lupa-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We got delivery from there two weeks ago and were so disappointed. Maybe the pandemic has taken a toll on the kitchen. We ordered chicken liver crostini - bland and soggy, escarole salad - not bad but $19?  Short rib strozapretti - okay if it weren't from a high end Italian restaurant, broccoli rabe - bland, could have used some red pepper flakes or something and Eggplant and summer squash - really terrible with a weird sweetness to it.  No bread came with this order. No joke intended - and the portions were so small. With tax, tip and delivery fee the bill was $119.  Clearly not worth it. They got two stars because the order came promptly and was packed nicely. The food clearly wasn't the fault of the delivery service.

They would not tell us which organs and from ""who"" or what so we stopped asking.  After all, it's NY City. Two of the wines were very good and a good match. However two of the reds were not nearly strong or bold enough to stand up to the strong and ""organie"" meat sauce.  The wines flavors were lost.   On a bright note, our server was fantastic. Mave was her name I belief and she did a great job. Even took it in stride when we told her our disappoint with the final two wine parings.  Sadly, they're are so many good restaurants in NY City that it's hard to ever go back to something that was just ""ok""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/lupa-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The best prosciutto I've ever had, plus other excellent appetizers. However, saltimbocca was incredibly disappointing, so tough the serrated steak knife was incapable of sawing through parts of it.

The uneven quality is certainly not what it was when Mario was running it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/lupa-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered the octopus appetizer and it was severely over cooked and difficult to chew. I also ordered a whole fried fish which didn't even come to me as a whole fish but a chopped up small portion. The fish itself had bones everywhere and was not properly descaled, I was spitting out bones and scales almost every bite. I am a huge cacio e Pepe lover but this dish extremely bland I had to ask for extra salt and pepper to try to make it taste decent. Other than the food it took about two hours to get fed.

I honestly don't know why it only has 4 stars on here because it is fantastic. My friend and I started out with a couple of drinks. The drinks were reasonably priced for this area (it is more expensive than what we would typically see at home in, but we weren't surprised by this) . They brought out some warm bread and oils to start with and it was out of this world. I had two baskets. For entrees, we got the perfect Negron. I'm practically drooling just thinking about the food haha it was so good. I had no doubt the crispy cod, but I'm fairly picky with fish sometimes. However, it was cooked perfectly and was served on a bed of tomato sauce and sweet, grilled chipollini onions.

I saw that they had a tasting menu and of course, the idea of having bowl after bowl of pasta is appealing to just about everyone, and I didn't know how to choose just one to sum up a restaurant's experience! The pasta at Lupa is super tasty, and any dish with the guanciale is TO DIE FOR. It is probably the best tasting bacon-esque thing that I have ever eaten. Insider tip, if you get the tasting menu, you can take leftovers of each home in small boxes. It's a LOT of just straight up pasta and sauce.

The house bread was very good, which is always a huge bonus and they brought out seconds. The service was very attentive and my server explained options on the menu thoroughly.

I went with my friend on a Tuesday afternoon around 4pm to get a couple drinks before heading across the street for dinner. The waiter outside was very kind to us and told us to head right to the bar. That's where our experience went SOUTH. The bartender didn't bother to look our way even though he saw us walk in (we made eye contact). The bar and restaurant were pretty much empty with only a couple at the bar that was almost finished with their meal and drinks. We had to ASK for drinks without him asking us what we wanted. We then asked for a menu; which was an ordeal in its own. After it was all said and done he wasn't friendly nor did he care for our business even though we were nothing but nice to him. HERE'S the kicker: I always save my receipts with what I tip. We gave him $5 for pouring 4 glasses of wine.... Which is COMPLETELY reasonable. Well, my credit card statement came out a day ago and it said he added FOUR EXTRA DOLLARS on top of my already $5 tip.

Christine G.,/user_details?userid=zVIC44CM1mmJTgH8Me1biQ,"Palatine, IL",5/31/2017,2.0,Went to Lupa with 4 friends to celebrate a birthday. We were expecting an amazing experience as we had heard so many great things. The food was average. I ordered the saltimbocca- it was plated so poorly. No color at all. Just a brown patty on my plate.

Matt C.,/user_details?userid=JZaCLxwJODzc0GueJZfYRg,"Evans, GA",10/1/2019,3.0,"We went to this restaurant based on the recommendation of Rachel Ray for the pasta. We had the casserecce with short rib meat sauce and papardelle with chantrelles. The pasta was tasty and cooked well. You could tell the pasta was fresh. The short rib meat was a little tough/dry which was disappointing as I'm used to short rib meat in a sauce falling apart. I had to cut the meat pieces with a knife. Overall the flavors were good but nothing stood out to bring value to the cost. This was the most costly meal we've had in NY but the food was not the best. Also, Lupa by far has to be the most over priced wine list in the country! They are selling $19 bottles of wine for $100!!!

Showed up on a Saturday night and we were seated right away. We were served bread, which was delicious, and also ordered wine. They serve wine by the quartino here which is great if you don't want to order a bottle but want a little bit more than a glass. For the entree, I ordered the cacio e pepe, which is seemingly a very simple dish. I couldn't even eat this dish as it was unbearably salty/peppery. Our waiter never came back to check on us after being served so didn't even have the option of sending it back. My friend also tried some of mine and couldn't even finish his bite.

Had to wait a bit even though we had a reservation, and froze our asses off the entire meal, as the front door had to be open so servers could easily access those diners freezing outside. The first course, and best, was the bread offering- 2 pieces of crostini with a hummus-like spread and 3 pieces of melt in your mouth focaccia. Octopus was next, undercooked, and a very skimpy portion. Then came the cacio e pepe, which was undercooked as well. I'm not talking ""al dente"", I'm talking undercooked.

The Escarole, Walnut, Red Onion & Pecorino salad was a treat because the escarole was not bitter (first time ever!). The beet salad was so good we had to order another one. The pastas were the right portions, flavors, rich and beautiful. The Bavette Cacio e Pepe was spicy but addictive. Then came the desserts. OH, the desserts. We tried new things - Apician Spiced Dates with Mascarpone and Olive Oil Cake with Espresso Cherries. Paradise on a plate.

We decided to start our meal ordering the spinach salad, the spiedini and salami platters. Absolutely delicious. The salad was so well dressed and had amazing flavor with the crispy porchetta. If pasta is what you want then do not by any means forget to order the gnocchi. It's absolutely amazing. The fluffy pillows of goodness were to die for. Honestly one of the best gnocchis ive had. Filled with ricotta and a flavorful sauce with sausage these were amazing. We also shared the caccio e Pepe which was good. But no where near as good as the gnocchi. Highly recommend this place!

M L.,/user_details?userid=-9xc2UfLsv8H60FB3XdsXw,"New York, NY",12/5/2017,3.0,I've had good experiences here before but this last time was not good. Very charming neighborhood place. Our server was very good. Attentive and gave us the menu run down. Very knowledgeable about wine and will let you taste any wine or amaro.  Not a fan of their focaccia. Usually end up asking for the sliced sourdough. Apps were good. The carbonara and the veal were so over salted I didn't eat any of it. Had to send the pasta back and the veal I just took to go bc I felt bad. My bf ravioli was good but also still heavy with the salt. I'm not that sensitive to salt  but even to me it was too much and my poor diabetic/ hypertensive mom went home hungry.  Probably won't be back after this experience. Too expensive to not eat anything.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/lupa-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Stephanie S.,/user_details?userid=x-iKEoxwWXInYXDlIwEj2g,"Seattle, WA",6/10/2019,2.0,"I'm guessing we may have hit them on an ""off"" day but unfortunately everything went awry for us when visiting Lupa for lunch.  I ordered the pre-fixe lunch with anti pasta (very tasty), cacio e Pepe (pretty good) and ricotta/honey dessert (pretty good).  My husband had the carbonara.  Service was fine, slightly standoffish but helpful.  We were there at about 1pm so after the lunch rush and there were only a handful of tables sat.  Unfortunately they served the couple behind us's food to us (which we realized after they finally did get their food when we were paying our check) which threw off the whole process, as their meal was very close to ours but one dish off, so we sent back the wrong pasta dish, but since one was served and pasta sucks cold one of us started eating.  That meal was completely gone before we got the other corrected dish.  My husband's food was ok, but had onions all over it which he does not like and was not listed (nor is it a normal addition to carbonara) so his meal was effectively ruined.  Neither dish was stand out in anyway, so for the price we were fairly underwhelmed.  Neither of us were asked how our meal was or offered fresh grated cheese on top (the table next to us was).  They did take off one of our dishes from the bill which was a nice gesture but honestly should have happened because our lunch experience over all sucked and still cost over $30 for one person with no alcohol.  With all the options NY had to offer they really dropped the ball at Lupa.  Hopefully we experienced an anomaly but would not be back after this experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/lupa-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The chef gave us a complimentary dish which consisted of some type of homemade sauce on too of a cracker bread. I'm not so sure what kind of sauce it was but it was really really good. As an appetizer, my boyfriend and I had the special for the night. It was mozzarella cheese on top of this really crunchy bread which made up for the soft bread served since I do love crunchy bread. As my main dish, I had the Bavette Cacio e pepe which I only ate half of. In my opinion, the portion was great since I'm a small water but my boyfriend had the spaghetti con pomodoro and thought it wasn't enough for him.

We started off with the spinach and speck salad. They pour the warm speck right off the pan with all the yummy juice on top of the salad. Makes my mouth just water thinking about it from last night! I honestly had a hard time deciding what I want to get for dinner. It was between the saltimbocca or what I ultimately ended up with which was caserecce short rib ragu. It was so damn delicious. The short rib was so flavorful that I'm still dreaming about. Honestly probably one of my top 5 pasta dishes ever.

The carbonara spaghetti was al dente and not too salty, but the sauce was too thick to be smooth going down. Finally the gnocchi were pillows of goodness and the sauce was very good.

The first waiter was attentive and courtieous but before our appetizer came he let is know that another server would be taking his place. Ok no problem is what we thought but was I wrong. First our three course meals came...slowly but they still came. I was only upset cause my 7 year old was getting hungry but she's tough she waited. But after the third course there was nothing. No 'How is everything' No refilling of our beverages No can I taken your empty plates nothing. Nothing for 30 minutes. Other patrons who came after us were promptly taken care of while we say and waited. Then after 30 minutes a gentleman came over and asked if I was finished. To which I replied in was finished over 20 minutes ago. I excused myself to the rest room and when I came back expecting coffee for us and ice cream for my kid but my wife's face said a different story. She said get the check I want to leave now. Ok no problem. I got the check paid and we left. Outside she tells me while we were at the bathroom they came cleared the played and that was it. She asked one of the guys for a desert menu and he didn't even offer one but said ""oh you want you desert?"" She said yes and coffee but since you brought everyone else menus and asked them I guess we're not good enough so forget it. He said to her...""ok"" and walked away. Really? So glad for YOUR staff she didnt tell me this inside because you would have not only heard my mouth EVERYONE would have heard my mouth. How hard is it to wait on everyone equally? Maybe my skin color isn't right?  Was that it? Was the hipster white kids behind us who ordered two bowls of pasta with water yet got allot of attention better than us? Seriously you see she was upset so a simple sorry and bringing menus isn't too hard. Real sad part.... This isn't the first time we've been here.

The food is delicious and the service is fantastic. Anytime I had a question about wine selections the bartender or waiter knew the perfect pairing for my meal. I recommend making a reservation because they're usually busy but a lot of the time they have seating at the bar. You typically don't have to wait for a table when you make a reservation but if you do it's a max of a 5-10 minute wait.

Lupa definitely had a huge crowd, and that was the reason I made a reservation 3 weeks ago. After arriving on time at 9pm and waiting 25 minutes we were finally seated without so much as a ""sorry about the wait."" It seemed like the type of place where the hosts really didn't care if you stayed or went, in fact it probably would have made their job easier so maybe they were hoping we would leave. When we finally sat down our waiter was fantastic. He was extremely attentive and he even split the portions for us up in the kitchen before serving them. We got the carbonara, short rib ragu & and the amatriciana. The ragu was unbelievable but the rest of the dishes were underwhelming. My onions and pancetta were black thats how burnt they were, and the carbonara was bland. It wasn't the worst food I've ever had, but shouldn't be on any type of best pasta list. You can get a much better meal (for a lot cheaper) at Il Corralo down the street.

It is always crowded so New Yorkers must think the same way. The food isn't as pricey as Babbo's, yet the ingredients are still super fresh and everything is excellent here, even the price. I ate here with a friend of mine, we didn't drink alcohol, each had an appie, pasta dishes, and dessert and the bill came to under $100 total. My favorite pasta here is a simple bavette pasta. It looks like thin flat noodles with butter, salt, black pepper, and cheese but it's so good! My friend got the special, flat fat noodles with braised short ribs.

I came here on a Sunday hoping that the wait for a table would not be too bad - it was just one hour. My friend and I had wine at the bar and were seated probably only 45 minutes after arriving. For appetizers we split the mozzarella and prosciutto, which may have been the best prosciutto I've ever had. I had the carbonara and he had the short rib ragu - both were fantastic.

We wandered through Houston and I knew Lupa would be the place to go. We left our name and waited an hour as the venue was packing with many guests. Host was very polite and super friendly (great accent), we sat by a corner table thay opened us a view of the entire restaurant. We had a light salad to start, shared a Carbonara which is always a must, and also shared a pork entree which was so flavorful. We had a semifreddo dessert and had a bottle of Barbaresco which the Som help us choose. Amazing service as expected, our Server was very polite very approachable and helped us course our meal. The Backwaiters were superb always smiling and attentative. Will continue to come here, its a Gem in the SoHo area and I can't wait to come back.

We got the beets and pistachios and the olives as appetizers. Then we had the sweet potato agnolotti which was to die for and the cacio e pepe for pasta. For our main courses I had the fluke with brussel sprouts and potatoes and my boss had the saltimbocca. My fish was cooked perfectly. For dessert we had the tartufo and it's one of the best desserts I've ever had. Lupa was still as good as I remember it. DELICIOUS.

They couldn't sit us until everyone was present- EXCEPT for the guy they sat in a table for four (presumable our table) who was waiting for his guests to arrive. When the hostess was confronted with this, she said the owner did that. Really? I didn't see Joe Bastianich do this. That's wrong. They sat someone in our table who was waiting for his guests to arrive, and we were told to wait. 30 minutes later, we left. I'll never go back, regardless of reviews.

I like to go on Saturdays because they have an amazing chicken special (a whole baby chicken w an egg on top). Last night, the bread was stale. Then the server brought the wrong chicken. He apologized and took it back and told me it would be 12 minutes for anew one, which was fine. They brought me 1/4 of a chicken w an egg on top.  It was a sad little plate of food they charged me full price for. When I complained, the waiter said he agreed it looked small when he saw one at another table.

Yesterday's lunch with split appetizer, carafe of wine each, and a pasta for me and chicken for friend was $100 with tax and tip.

The staff kept chatting amongst themselves while they ignored us but clearly saw us waiting. After pretty much all of them made eye contact with us but didn't acknowledge us I said is anyone going to help us? Which seemed to confuse them further. We than turned around to walk out and STILL no one came to sit us!

James S.,/user_details?userid=kJnbLIPdJ6QOu_USBdfuZA,"New York, NY",2/22/2012,4.0,"Went here at 6PM on a Wednesday.  The front of the restaurant is more noisy and casual but our table was in the back room, which is a quieter environment with tablecloths and such.  We started out with the charred mackerel and the buffalo milk mozzerella.  I was expecting the outside skin of the mackerel to be crispy but it wasn't.  It tasted pretty good, though.  For the primi, we split a bowl of linguettine with calimari & meyer lemon. The citrus was certainly present but subtly done.  It tasted exactly how you'd expect it to taste.  I noticed that the pasta was cooked to the point that it was a bit softer than al dente, but that's fine by me because that's the way I like it.  My entree was the braised short rib with gnocco al romana.  Pro tip: this gnocco is nothing like the gnochhi pasta that I've eaten.  This was more like a thick, rich disc of polenta except smooth and not grainy.  It was really good.  As for the short rib, I had to warm up to this one but by the end of it I was a fan.  The outside part was ok, but I thought it was slightly overcooked.  However, once I started eating the inside portion I found that part to be perfectly cooked - moist and tender, well marbled and flavorful.  I think they used some sort of balsamic sauce.  We finished up with a cheese plate with robiola, la tur, and gorgonzola.  Very creamy, rich, and interesting flavors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/lupa-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ivan W.,/user_details?userid=r7FizJA28JK_0wQmfEpgjg,"Lancaster, PA",7/29/2010,4.0,"One of our favorites in NYC. Food is always excellent, but this time service was disappointing. We were there early when there were only a few tables, but even after it started to get busier the wait staff seemed more interested in hanging around the bar chatting than attending their tables. Every so often they would suddenly realize they were there to do a job, but as soon as possible they would migrate back to resume their conversations. We'll hope this was an off night, as the service in Batali restaurants is usually top-notch. Food - 4.5 Service - 3.

Not pretentious, great quality food (the Bucatini All' Amatriciana tastes like the pasta I had in Italy), fantastic wine, and relaxed but efficient service.  We love to park ourselves at the bar and although we always say we want to try something new we usually go for the Saltimboca, Spaghetti alla Carbonara & the Bucatini (we share it all and it's plenty).  Also, took the in-laws here and they loved it!
