Kind of strange, but we'll play ball. We ordered five skewers for dinner. First off, the skewers each came on an awkwardly gigantic plate, which took up the entirety of an already scarce table because of these small plates that no one ordered! Secondly, the metal skewer came hot, and they'll repeatedly warn you about that, but there really isn't an elegant way to eat the meat without giving yourself first degree burns. While the food was good (granted, it's hard to mess up grilled meat with salt, pepper and olive oil), the portions left a lot to be desired. For example, a $37 octopus shishlik came with skewer full of vegetables and two pieces of octopus.

I only have one word to describe this sandwich-RIDICULOUS. Seriously, it's some next level burger. They grill the burger with the cheese so part of the cheese gets all crispy but the part that's inside the patty is all melted goodness. Then they stuff the ginormous cheese filled patty inside of the softest most pillow-like pita that's filled with toppings including sauce. Some locations even give you a giant green pepper to go with the sandwich which by the you should be stuffing inside the sandwich because there's no better way to eat it. I also tried their cauliflower and it was good but a bit too bland for me. Oh and their hummus is delicious!! It's creamy and topped with chickpeas and this green relish?

We ordered the army stew, cod roe udon, pork belly rice crepe, and makgeolli to share between 4 people. We felt quite full by the end but if you have big eaters at your table you might want to order a bit more since the portions are a bit smaller. Everything was presented beautifully and delicious. The pork belly rice crepe was pretty sweet and the injeolmi texture was more gooey than like a crepe, which not everyone will like. Cod roe udon was incredible though!

Well that statement pertains to this restaurant- this place opened at 5 pm on a Friday, my party of 3 got there at 5:45 pm and we had to wait 30 minutes because the place was packed! They don't even take reservations! Anyway this place was definitely worth it. I highly recommend the raspberry rice wine- the peach rice wine is the signature drink but raspberry was better.  Definitely order the crispy corn pancake, garlic spicy chicken (a bit spicy, you might not like it if you don't like spicy food), and the pork belly rice crepe wraps- a little on the sweeter side.

So, we opted for the corn/cheese pancake but was again rudely told by the server that it was not vegetarian friendly - it has ""meat powder"" on it. We asked if there was anything vegetarian friendly and the server just scoffed and told us that there was nothing on the menu. The only saving grace was the manager because he saw how upset we were and he kindly helped with our situation by making an exception to not include meat with their rose pasta dish.

We liked everything we got and appreciate the complimentary rice cakes. Another review said that the squid in the squid fried rice tasted like the Asian dried squid snack and that is so spot on.

First of all the makgeolli was amazing, and the tteokbokki banchan was so good that we asked for a second serving lol. We started with the spicy bulgogi fries - came with a lot of meat and mayo on top. The short rib chapaguri was what I was most excited for and it turned out super good. It may look really dark but not overly salty at all. It has a great black bean flavor with a touch of spice, and a lot of short ribs. The spicy tofu soup was good too, especially on a cold evening. A lot of tofu and meat as always but wished there was more vegetable and kimchi.

I also love that they serve a small plate of ddukbokki as a side dish! One thing I always order here is the braised pork belly - its slightly different from the traditional style but oh my tastes so good - the meat is tender and chewy and the scallion/cabbage go very well with it. As appetizer we got the rose cream bento pasta which is so delicious - you gotta try it and the fact it's in a bento box makes it look more like a comfort food. We usually order the army stew (budaejjigae) which is pretty good, but this time tried out the pork belly rice crepe wraps - it's more sweet with the drizzled sauce that def tastes more like injeolmi (Korean rice cake). However the meat tasted a bit too hard to bite through and we got tired of the sweet taste, even with the pickles. That being said, the food has been consistently great the many times I've been so I don't dock off any star. Make sure to get a resy because the wait during peak hours for walk-ins is at least 30 minutes for two ppl.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/take31-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The outdoor space was closed, but my friend and I were able to get a seat indoors. They have good separation between the tables if you are concerned with being too close to the party next to you. We tried the seafood and scallion pancake, the garlic fried rice, and the wasabi cream chicken. The pancake was flavored nicely, but it was more like a scallion pancake than what I expected. it was deep fried strongly and it had an oil residue. I really liked the garlic fried rice since the garlic flavoring was really pronounced. Finally the chicken, I thought it the flavor profile really worked, but it was overly fried and felt like I was eating a lot of breading. Overall, the meal was fine, but wished I tried food that wasn't overly fried.

They give you some free spicy rice cake as an appetizer and its actually pretty delicious! The braised pork belly and pork belly rice crepe wrap are my absolute two favorites. The pork in both dishes are super tender and flavorful. The cod roe seafood udon is pretty amazing as well. You get a lot of food for the price, and it is all very filling.

The udon is more on the smaller portion side but IT'S SOOO yummy. It's really flavorful and you just want to keep eating it!!

Jae C.,/user_details?userid=7cIPujlDqG9zkG53VHOaUQ,"Westwood, NJ",9/13/2019,3.0,"Uh, no.. the place is overrated. Interesting and trendy menu items collaborating amercan and korean cuisines but they don't taste as good as they look in pictures on their menu.. everything lacks deep flavors and taste like it's quickly made. It is presented in nice plates though. The best thing I'd say is the free side of ttuk bok yi which is spicy rice cakes.. and even that's overly sweet. Drinks and food are so over priced. I've had the similar quality of korean food at take out shops for a lot cheaper. Ambience is nice though and cutely decorated with asian flare. However, it gets loud in there and filled with young kids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/take31-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I've been coming here since around 2015 and have been coming here ever since. The cod roe seafood cream udon is a must and I love the braised pork belly as well. The udon is so creamy and has the perfect amount of seafood flavor!! I tried the pork belly crepe thing with soybean powder recently, which was still good but it definitely comes in second to the braised pork. The makkeoli and soju cocktails are so good as well. The lychee and the yogurt soju and the chestnut makkeoli are definitely the best. The lychee has little bits of real lychee blended in and it's also really icy and delicious. The chestnut makkeoli is so creamy and almost feels like you're drinking a milkshake.

The ambiance was very cozy and warm. We ordered the cod roe udon which was creamy and delicious. Also ordered the corn pancake and the army stew, which I had for the first time. I learned the recipe was created after the Korean War when food was scarce and locals had to make a meal from surplus foods from army bases (hence the spam, hotdogs, American cheese, etc). I didn't think I'd like it at first but the tanginess of the kimchi really cuts through the fat in the spam and balances out the dish.

Carol L.,/user_details?userid=LKaEiBYGBnB8Df1hUyEnLA,"New York, NY",5/9/2018,4.0,"Friend recommended this place in Ktown for our quarterly hangout dinner, and I hadn't heard of it before so I was super down to try it. We went to dinner ~6:30 pm on a weekday night, and were seated immediately to both of our surprise (the restaurant was full). It's kind of weirdly situated in that it's a really long and narrow restaurant, with kitchens both in the center and in the back and seating in the front and in the mid back. We were seated right next to the center kitchen in the back portion, so it was fun seeing them make drinks and watch the large pan of dukbokki swimming in Korean hot sauce. We got a beef hotpot of sorts, a seafood kimchi pancake, as well as a pineapple vodka drink to share between the two of us. The drink was delicious, and so pretty! I have a thing against paper straws because I drink slowly and it disintegrates fast, so that was annoying. But the drink is super cute and super good too, you can't even taste the alcohol! The food came out maybe 15 minutes later, and we were both impressed with both foods. The hotpot is good, not as extravagant as its sister restaurant Her Name is Han next door, but still good nonetheless. The seafood pancake was good too, with delicious dipping sauce (soysauce/sesame oil? a mix of the two?). It came out to be ~$50 for the both of us, which was totally fine because we left stuffed and with leftovers to boot. I think I like Her Name is Han better just because of the actual restaurant and how cute it is, but I would be totally for coming back to Take31 if Her Name is Han was too busy or I were looking to eat in Ktown, but slightly off Ktown",https://www.yelp.com/biz/take31-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The atmosphere is there was really nice and quite comfy and cozy. The food was great, there was a lot of good food to pick from so i asked for a recommendation from a waiter and they the recommended the budae jjigae. I also just had to try the fried chicken since after all thats why i came here.

They textures were all so good, crispy pancake + chicken and the delicious creamy broth. I loved the little bits of fun fusion aspects of the dishes, like cheese in the creamy broth or the crispy ""nooroongji"" that looked like rice crispies on the soup.

After sitting down the server came like 15min later. Fortunately the food didn't come too late. So basically started waiting around 6:40 and finally got to eat around 8:30. Not to say it's bad that place is so popular, I would expect the front person to give me a better estimate. I will choose somewhere else if I know I am gonna wait that long cause it's cold outside and I am never a person who's willing to wait for food over an hour, for any restaurant. If keeping customer waiting way beyond how long they are told to is their strategy, I would say it's a bad one cause I won't be willing to come back.

The first time we ordered the bossam, which is one of the best I've had in awhile. This time we were craving something soup-y on a rainy day and so we ordered the Nagasaki. It's a spicy, white seafood stew, which at first glance doesn't look as if it can't be spicy but it does have a bit of kick to it, though I would've liked more. It was also a tad bit salty and the flame underneath didn't last that long--I wish it would've stayed hot for longer. We also ordered the fried stuffed peppers, which were okay, but I had hoped the ground meat would have kept together better. We also ordered the crispy chicken with wasabi dip. The chicken wasn't crispy and the wasabi taste was a bit faint. The complimentary ddukkbokkk was nice.

Meaning, I can't help but feeling like a sardine in a city wide can. This place is filled to the brim, using every inch of its space to satisfy the needs of mostly college and high school kids. Cheap, fast, easy and delicious. Yes, corners were cut but it's expected. Walking the block of K Town was meaningful to say the least. ""Shileamneda"" (sorry, excuse me) is said a lot.

Nhung Q.,/user_details?userid=-tJ607rOpEBj8orbBvBkKA,"New York, NY",4/21/2019,4.0,"My boyfriend and I were eager to try a new place and figured to come here last night. We arrived around 8:30 Pm and it was a 20 min wait on a Saturday which wasn't bad at all. It had a lively environment with a very young crowd. We ordered the braised pork belly (we contemplated between the small and large portion) and ordered the large. Which did not disappoint. Honestly, that pork belly alone made this restaurant worthy to be a regular customer. It melted in your mouth and was seasoned to perfection. We also ordered a hot pot for one of those rainy NY days. We got the bone in pork hot pot which was also very tasty. I think this was actually the perfect amount of food if you have a good appetite. The hot pot didn't have too many things in it so it's not super filling but the bone in pork was delightful. I also ordered for dessert, the green tea honey brioche with green tea ice cream. This dessert would've been great if the outside coating of the dessert wasn't pure sugar. It was way too sweet on the outside. If the outside of the brioche was cut out I think it would've made an excellent dessert.

Food is great! I ordered the cream udon which is a fave dish of mine wherever it's offered. It's like fettuccine sauce with udon noodles and lots of sea food!! It's just a delicious combination. The bossam is really really good. I would recommend getting the large one bc the mini bossam was too small for me. Like I could probably eat a large one all by myself bc it's so so good haha. I also like their fried chicken with wasabi cream a lot.

It's weird to say because it seems like in any restaurant, you recommend a few things, but I feel like my friends even say that anything you get here is good. I love the atmosphere as I am a fan of good vibes and music. You would expect that even though it is loud and crowded that service wouldn't be good, but the waiters always check up on you and are there for you when you need them. I came with one friend this time and sat in a two seat, but when I asked to move somewhere else as another friend was coming, the waiters were polite to move us to a different table.

This place is cute and bigger inside than I thought. The waiter was really nice in helping us narrow down what to get since we almost over ordered though I do wish we did get to try the corn pancake too in hindsight. We started off with their complimentary spicy rice cakes that we could have refilled but didn't and shared their spam musubi rice balls, cod roe seafood udon, and rice crepe pork belly dishes. Everything was good with the spam being our favorite dish but the pork belly was a bit dry since it was mostly lean meat so I do wish we tried the braised pork belly instead though the rice crepe wrapped around it is definitely unique and surprised us with a sweet peanutty sauce on it. I wish I had room to try their dessert toast, which I was eyeing but I didn't so maybe next time along with the corn pancake!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/take31-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My favorite thing here was the chestnut makgeolli. We ordered the cod roe seafood udon, pork belly rice crepe wrap, and creamy kimchi stew, and the best was probably the pork belly rice crepe wrap. The cod roe seafood udon was really good but got too rich towards the end so we couldn't finish it, and the shrimp was a little annoying to peel since it was smothered in creamy sauce. The creamy kimchi stew was unique in that it had nurungji (toasted rice) but it was just too creamy with the creamy udon so that was on us. I probably would've enjoyed it more if that was the only thing we ordered. It seemed pretty similar to budae jjigae and the portion size was a little small for being $20.

They have an extremely extensive menu, geared towards sharing and pairing with soju or beer. My friends and I shared the pork belly and the beef short ribs. They start you out with a complimentary spicy rice cake dish that was super spicy, but a good way to pique your appetite. The pork belly itself was marinated perfectly, but personally I'm not a fan of eating the actual fatty portions. The short ribs came in a huge bowl, drenched in sauce, and topped with kabocha squash fries. The meat was cooked well, but the sauce was a little too salty for my taste. I loved the kabocha squash fries on top, that added a surprising lightness to the dish. We also had an order of the crab onigiri, which was good but had a little too much mayo.

There is far better flavored Korean food in New York, like one restaurant I always go to at Saint Marks and 3rd. I like food with rich and complicated flavors, but Korean food, in my opinion, is usually the more simple and ""blunt"" kind compared to say French or Chinese, so if the restaurant makes it in the simple and ""blunt"" way it is doubly mediocre (barbecue and chicken wings excluded, they are supposed to be simple and blunt).

We ended up waiting OVER ONE HOUR in the cold for a party of 2. I was pretty disappointed at the way they handled this situation; we checked in after 35-40 minutes of waiting, since the male hostess mentioned this would be the wait time. At an hour we checked in and he said he called our name but no one responded. We were standing right in front of the door under the heat fan and our name was never called, nor we were asked of ours when he saw us standing there for so long. After finally being seated, we got our drinks and food. Although the food was delicious, I'm very hesitate to come back here after that kind of treatment.

Ruben P.,/user_details?userid=Z5dwsBYAf49frIPf8hAqWw,"New York, NY",2/13/2023,2.0,"Right off the bat, I gotta say the place looks great. Furniture, music, ambiance, servers, everything about this place looks nice. I came here twice just for drinks before, and this was my first time for dinner. And here is why I'm leaving a two stars review: we got food poisoned. We ordered steamed mussels, dumplings and a big red snapper for two. Everything tasted pretty good - besides perhaps a bit too seasoned - but definitely the flavors were good. Too bad the fish was not cooked well and probably even too old. We spent the night in the restroom you can imagine why. Be very careful, and perhaps just come for drinks and music, but I do not recommend the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

In the area and she recommended this gem of a spot since she often came here when worked in the area. First thing I noticed was the dim lighting which I am a huge fan of in restaurants and bars. We sat in the front where there is more of a bar setting but in the back is their restaurant. To be honest.... we did not eat but enjoyed a few of their drinks. One was a spicy style drink which was so good, but I sadly forgot the name of it. Our server was extremely helpful in picking out cocktails and had a funny personality which made the experience that much more enjoyable. I'd love to come back to this place for the atmosphere, drinks, and late-night partying which I hear is a VIBE!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

A friend had raved about this place and it did not disappoint. The interior decor is so cool and the place has a nice vibe. Our waitress was a doll and checked on us all night, she was so sweet. The menu is really eclectic and combines many international cuisines. We had the Ants climbing the tree (noodles), chicken & pork dumplings, mushroom croquettes and fried rice. Everything was delicious!! Oh and you must save room for the donut holes with vanilla cream and dulce de leche dessert! Also the drinks were amazing the bar is so cool.

Michelle L.,/user_details?userid=IBMI3FEp1qW_PbPlIsB2cA,"Brooklyn, NY",2/19/2022,2.0,"the server kept telling them it was soup based and almost suggested they shouldn't order it. We were all confused as my friends still wanted that dish. I'm vegetarian/vegan and had the fried spinach dumplings. They were ok but would have preferred them without cheese. I did like the shishito peppers because they were vegan (I think) and the portion was generous. I ordered the hoisin noodles as it was pretty much the only entree available. It's called hoisin Hakka. To the restaurant, hoisin means seafood in Chinese so perhaps an update to the name would make it more clear. The noodles were disappointing. Very hard and I didn't finish them. Despite giving us a two hour dining limit our server was hard to pin down the rest of the evening. It took almost 30 mins to get our dessert and another 20 mins to process our cards. We asked for individual cards if possible and the server said it would take a longer ""minute"". Had we know it would take 20 we would have done one card. We left almost an hour after our allotted time so I guess there was a no show.

No explanation, no reason they just wont. The place was completely empty and its just me and a friend and they refuse to make me one Long Island. They also refuse to make Lychee Martinis. Didnt know since the name is Macao they adopted communist rules as well and decide what you can and cannot drink. Youd think during a pandemic thats forcing all the restaurants in NYC to close up permanently and the fact I was sober and just wanted one drink theyd want to make some money and make me a happy customer.

Scott D.,/user_details?userid=o8rI5LX3BpJfTd--yxjTwA,"New York, NY",6/12/2021,4.0,I don't do Yelp. I don't like Yelp and generally I think people who spend their time writing online reviews need something better to do. But I feel like I understand them now and this is the only way to vent my frustrations without being a Karen and calling the restaurant and having to talk to a person. A friend invited me for dinner here last Saturday and I will say the food and the vibe was exceptional. The Maitre' D was very personable and the hostess was gracious. Drinks were good. The only thing is that our waitress was downright mean. She was so aggressive and snappy that we felt uncomfortable. For someone that small she was the rudest angriest person I've ever met and she was the only reason I didn't have a blast here. She honestly made me want to walk out and leave.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The Dr. Funk, the Gola Lola, and the West Side are all exceptional but my absolute favorites are the Kaffir Jimlet [kaffir lime-infused fords gin mixed with lime juice & agave nectar], the Drunken Dragon's Milk [green tea vodka shaken with young coconut puree, thai basil & their house specialty five-spice bitters], and the Ciao Rizo [chipotle infused espolón blanco shaken with lime juice, lemongrass syrup & a pinch of cilantro leaves]. The place is typically packed so arrive expecting that but the ambiance is absolutely magical and the host staff always do their best to attempt to squeeze you in somehow. The bar staff is exceptional. I've shared a couple of small plates with friends and they've always been nice but the primary focus for me has always been the extraordinary cocktail menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I met up with a few friends for cocktails and was instantly impressed. A sweet tea vodka fan for life, I always judge a bar if they have that offering. Interesting they did not offer sweat tea vodka but rather had Green Tea Vodka. Always willing to give something new a try, I ordered one of the specials and it was delicious. Our stomachs were driving our ordering decisions. We tried several small plates and of note, the fried rice is what I best remember. Oh, and the doughnuts at the end were a very good choice. The food and the drinks were the highlights. The downside is the music was quite loud and it made it difficult to hear my  friends at time.

The drinks are really delicious and special. My favorite is the drunken dragon milk - green tea vodka with puréed young coconut and lime - amazing flavor. Although it's a heavier, sweeter drink than I normally go for - I may already be developing an obsession with this cocktail. The mushroom truffle croquettes are incredible with just the right balance of flavors. The scallop and chive dumplings also achieve a great flavor. The burrata and sautéed kale were good picks too. The interior is very soothing and dark, it has a nice way about it. The staff is attentive and helpful.

The server found us outside after we had already left the restaurant to inform us of the mistake. She could have kept the extra cash for herself but chose to be honest and that really went a long way with our party as they ended up tipping her even more. So many great many items here!

Went there in a Monday night and it happened to be live music night which was a pleasant surprise. Tasteful soft jazz welcomed us to the beautiful decor and cozy setting. I was there with 2 other guests and we all enjoyed our cocktails (sorry I can't remember the names). We had steamed shrimp dumplings to start which left us yearning for more. Definitely the highlight of our meal. Second highlight was the crispy fish. Flavorful and juicy just like it should be. The server kindly  offered to fillet us it for us, but I happened to be there with a chef thus we kindly declined. The fried rice was unfortunately pretty salty.

Krystal W.,/user_details?userid=8E13_FypKMxTz-ELMGwGcQ,"Houston, TX",12/2/2015,4.0,"Came here for a really early snack before a 1030 dinner. Absolutely solid and I cannot wait to try other things on the menu. We split an order of dumplings, half steamed and the other half fried. I was not a fan of the fried as it was definitely not what I was used to. It ended up being deep fried and not pan. The steamed were very good. We also got the Lobster noodles and oh my goodness. I'd come downtown just for that dish. I'd eat it every day if I could. It had an entire tail of lobster sitting on top that was grilled and seemingly, the rest of the lobster was in the noodles. Lots of chunks of perfectly cooked lobster through out. The sauce was super spicy and creamy. Cannot say enough about those noodles! For my cocktail (well I ended up getting 3 of them, that's how delish they were) I got the Yellow Fever. Peachy and full of fresh ginger.

I really felt like I was in a trading dock or parlor in the early 1900s. The food though was really disappointing. The ""African Chicken"" with piri piri (what is that?), sesame slaw, and peanut curry sauce was really just chicken with some Asian flavored sauce splattered on it. The ""Macanese Lobster Noodle"" was two pieces of lobster - you'd think I'd at least get half a lobster for $32 - mixed in with oversalted fermented chili noodles.

The ambiance is awesome, it's straight out of a movie, awesome old school Asian/Portuguese influence; the food is delicious, service is really good, and the drinks are to die for. There's an upstairs bar which is almost always packed and a small restaurant area. If you go on a Thursday-Saturday evening, they will also have the downstairs open. I love the downstairs, it's dark, lit with a bunch of candles, there are a few small tables and small bar and the bartenders are awesome. My favorite food items: mushroom & truffle croquettes, BBQ pork ribs and shrimp mozambique. All I amazing. I ADORE their Drunken Dragon's Milk drink, and their bashful maiden was really good too  If you tell the bartenders what type of liquor you like and the flavor you are looking for, they will throw something together and it will likely be AMAZING. My only minor complaint is, as one would expect, it's not cheap, but a super cool place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The first 2 times I was there I had the dish was made with lobster( as described on the menu here).

Christina G.,/user_details?userid=sNn49OwMPUBhMfozyGz2zw,"New York, NY",1/13/2016,4.0,"I visited Macao for the first time last week and have to say it was one of the best meals I have had recently. The interior of the space is dimly lit and stunning. Apparently it is fashioned to look like the brothels and opium dens of 1930's Macao. That definitely comes through, especially when you take a look at the artwork and scandalous figurines that pepper the stairwell to the downstairs speakeasy. Around 7pm on a Friday night there were plenty of seats available, but after 8pm the place really seemed to pick up. The drink list is great and we really enjoyed our cocktails. The favorite at our table was the Bashful Maiden.  Both the food and drink selection seems to be Asian inspired with an exotic twist. We split a number of appetizers and sides including the charred octopus, which was the best I have ever had. It had great texture and wasn't rubbery the way I have had it at some places. Our favorite thing by far were the mushroom and truffle croquettes. It was very difficult not to order more, they are a must!  Service was attentive and we were happy that they accommodated our walk in, despite there being a lot of reservations coming in. I will definitely visit again and would love to come back to the speakeasy for a sexy date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Even though most tables were full the hostess graciously gave us a booth at our request. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a smoky dark old world bar in Hong Kong back in the 50s,60s. It is romantic and funky with interesting drinks. I had the Mata Hari a cognac based drink and my Husband had the Bashful Maiden a gin drink. We started with the chicken and pork belly dumplings and the spareribs. Both were delicious and flavorful. We ordered our 2nd round of drinks when Franny our wonderful server informed us that we would have to wait since a health inspector made a surprise visit. They have an A rating which they still have after inspection. They are not allowed to mix cocktails or cook until inspection was completed. We were happy to wait since we were in no rush and it was Valentines Day. After inspection was completed our African Chicken and Veggie Fried rice came out. We split both and the chicken was moist and juicy and I could've eaten the fried rice all day. We ordered the banana split which Franny informed us was on the house cause of the inconvenience!

We started with some dumplings that were easily forgotten. The chaozhou style steamed cod was definitely fresh but lacked in any complex tastes; something one would expect from Asian cuisine. Same could be said for the African chicken which was only slightly better. We also quickly forgot the hakka noodles, and as far as cocktails go, you'll note it doesn't have much alcohol.

Sushma A.,/user_details?userid=66n2moiX-C3aZGiERmsOZA,"Brooklyn, NY",1/6/2012,4.0,Only ever been here for drinks. Twice I think. It's a nice place in terms of ambiance and type of crowd it attracts but the cocktails were just above average. Their dragon drink is worth trying couple of times but really does not get you buzzed. The rest of the cocktails were pretty good but nothing to wow about. If I am passing by I would be up for a quick pop in otherwise I am not sure I would trek across town to go. Their drinks are on the pricier side for the quality I though. *shrug*,https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were seated at the bar in the basement- The room at first seemed more like a private room/lounge. But as the crowd picked up, it had alot of potential to hang out and meet others. Most of the patrons were mid 20-30s professionals and seemed a somewhat fashionable. The menu was interesting and I don't necessarily mean that in a skeptic manner. Basically, you can choose a dish and have it either Asian or Portuguese style. The dishes were good but not amazing. Based on my tastes, some of them seemed over-seasoned. I'm supposing this is due to their well made cocktails and the intention to drink more and snack lightly. Thus, I'd recommend this place more for drinks and crowd (if you are looking to start off your Friday in style).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Taste wise, no complains there. We ordered the steamed chicken/pork dumplings which were great. We also had the mushroom and truffle croquettes and it was out of this world; if I ever come back to this place I would def get two orders of these bad boys, so friggin good! We also had the special fried rice of the night (spicy shrimp fried rice) along with the prawns and the african chicken which was more like a pigeon because it was so small. For dessert we had the brownie and the famous malasadas, both really good. We all ordered a whole bunch of drinks and out of everything my favorites were the Mikana (champagne based) and the Hong Kong cocktail, strong with a nice kick.

Joe V.,/user_details?userid=8ouRrJlPzmQUOW_LKm_e9Q,"Astoria, Queens, NY",8/24/2010,4.0,"Went here last night for a friend's surprise birthday party and it was delightful. As you walk in past the metal doors and observe the dim lighting, dark brick walls, wooden ladders, and the balcony littered with random objects, you will feel like you're dining in a warehouse from the 1940s as opposed to a modern restaurant in Tribeca. The food and decor is supposed to be inspired from the era where Portugal had a colony in China. If the food recipe is accurate, one would conclude that soy sauce was used heavily in that colony. I ordered the Peking Style Pork Ribs with a side of fried rice and nibbled on other dishes of people sitting next to me. The dishes were served with decent portions, tasty, and definitely  unique but I just couldn't ignore the heavy use of soy sauce. For dessert, I had the Coconut Panna Cotta and the Portuguese doughnuts with rum sauce. Both great but everyone in our table attacked the Portuguese doughnuts. Since the place is not very large, they were able to provide attentive service to all the tables. I was informed that they also have a lounge in the basement but I did not get a chance to check it out. I recommend this place to those who are open to experimenting with something new.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Our waiter was friendly, attentive and helpful, guiding us through the menu and offering informed cocktail suggestions. We sampled many of the dishes and found them all to be well prepared and seasoned and tasty. Shared desserts were equally pleasing.

L S.,/user_details?userid=KHZsBBgcMCnXPI2w_bMp2A,"Atlanta, GA",5/1/2013,2.0,"There are things that were great about this place and things that were really not. The atmosphere is cool, the bartender is spectacular but the food was below average. I started at the bar with a Malena and it was a very awesome drink. Bourbon, Campari and some other wacky ingredients but it definitely hit the spot. One gripe I have is that my date was a little late so I told the bartender we had a 6:00 reservation and wondered if I should let the Hostess know.. The place was empty at the time but I just didn't want them to think I was a no show. He said ""no problem' Well I checked my Open Table account today and they marked me as a no show...ding them a 1/2 star. When we did sit down our waitress was pleasant enough if a bit scattered. We ordered a bottle of the Pinot Blanc Blend from Alsace and she said they were out of it. Then she ends up bringing a bottle any way. As far as the food goes, any average place in Chinatown is better with PF Changs blowing it away. We started with the steamed dumplings which were good but the pork inside was a bit crunchy? We also ordered the calamari with olives and white beans. This plate was basically 1 long tentacle that was deep fried and a few beans on the plate...meh. For an entree we decided to split the chicken and the bacon and shrimp fried rice. The chicken was really dry. I thought it would be a classic Chinese chicken dish with cubes of chicken in sauce but it was basically a quarter of a chicken with some heavily seasoned skin sitting on a plate. You definitely had to drown the thing in peanut sauce in order to swallow it. The highlight of the meal was definitely the fried rice. It was served with a fried egg on top and once you mix that in the flavors were delish. Would I go back? Not for the food, maybe for the drinks and the place does get rockin after 7:00 pm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Krystian D.,/user_details?userid=Qq5k4KYtRA_Nnc5JgfpBiA,"New York, NY",4/3/2010,1.0,"The place was a disaster from the moment we entered the door. The hostess only mentioned there was a downstairs lounge with possible seating after we'd been standing in stilettos for nearly 30 minutes. We were given a table for six (although there were only two of us) and told we had an hour before they needed the table for a large party. Then, before we could order, we were asked to move to a smaller table because a large party had just arrived and they needed the table (we were compensated with a round of drinks). Mind you, we were told that the two seater was on reserve and we could not be seated there not five minutes before. Ok, despite this, we order and have a lovely (yet slow) meal. The Portuguese style chicken was amazing and the Chinese broccoli is delicious. I must say overall the quality of service and ambiance are nonexistent. Macao was understaffed and poorly managed. In fact, Brian, the manager last night, was the worse part of my experience. We asked our server to split the check and she paid the wrong amounts to each card. Brian, took over from there and says ""Well, we don't split checks. You've got one table, you get so one check. So tell me how much you want to put on each card."" Needless to say, this is highly inappropriate, demonstrates absence of class and professionalism. And then he pretended he could not assign appropriate sales tax to a $44 subtotal and asked us to do the math for tax as well. He never apologize for the mistake made to our bill and only apologized for his behaviour after I pointed out that it was disrepectful and just plain wrong. Neema, our server is an absolute doll and, even though she made an error in settling our bill, was totally gracious and is an asset to the establishment. Overall, I will never return because the good food and great dessert and far outweighed by disorganization and bad leadership.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The wine was great and the apps were too. The staff was very friendly and helped us figure out what to do because it was very loose not like a structured tasting so you could pair whichever wine you wanted with the food and wew weren't sure if we could sit at the tables or had to stay at the bar. I can't spell our servers name but she was a very nice asian yound woman (I want to say Jin but.....) she described the food and the wine and was really nice and helpful. we both liked her a lot. The gentleman at the dooor Mauricio was very friendly as well. Oh and they played good music as well, you could see the place gets jumping the later it gets!

Diana J.,/user_details?userid=dc-qy9Pj07EwdQEzZI7V4g,"QUEENS VILLAGE, NY",6/17/2022,3.0,"My coworker and I came to try this restaurant this past Wednesday to place our order to go. We had been anxiously anticipating it's grand opening and it finally happened. We were so excited to try a new soul food restaurant, unfortunately it didn't hit the mark. The restaurant itself is very spacious and clean (2 thumps up for that). We ordered the 4 piece fried chicken meal with a side of collard greens. 2 orders of the fried catfish with 2 sides (I got the mac and cheese and potato salad, my coworker got the Mac and cheese with yams). All 3 meals came with a piece of cornbread. For dessert we ordered the peach cobbler. The fried catfish and the chicken we felt were well seasoned and crispy, which is a plus. All the sides were mediocre, with the exception of the yams which were yamming according to my coworker lol. The cornbread was moist and on the sweet side which I did like. Lastly our peach cobbler dessert was pretty good, we just felt it needed more of the crust. Overall, I gave this restaurant a solid 3 and will probably not be returning anytime soon. Our grand total came to $82.65 for a to go order, which it's very pricey for the amount of food we received. This is also in consideration of their nearby competition, which offers so much more for less $.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cornbread-brooklyn-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Javone B.,/user_details?userid=taXd0t29kHKvMCL3Sd0kqg,"Brooklyn, NY",7/17/2022,3.0,"Ok let me start by saying Sunday brunch is put on by a very popular promoter and therefore the wait times are probably not the norm on a regular day. BUT, upon arrival there is no one who checks for your reservation. I walked inside to find the host to find out where we could sit. The promoter of the event (whom I know) advised me I could sit anywhere I wanted to outside. This was a B.Y.O.C. event but the wait for a server to come over and take our order was approx 30min. Had it not been for the vibes and the anticipation for the food, we probably would have left. But again, it's a Sunday brunch event with lots of people. When the server finally took our order, it took about 20min for the food to come. But where it did .....BAAAAAAABY it did not disappoint. I ordered the fried chicken, Mac n cheese, yams and rice with gravy and when I tell you the food was worth the wait. Geesh. My friend has the catfish, potato salad and greens; my other friend had the catfish Mac n cheese and yellow rice and after tasting their food, it was incredible too. The food here is so good. The cornbread was absolutely melt in your mouth good. If they could just fix the wait times, everything here would be perfect. So if you go on a Sunday, pack your patience and drink your champagne.

Jessica B.,/user_details?userid=ETrjemTEoaSiA87JxfV56w,"Brooklyn, NY",11/21/2022,5.0,"I know I came here just a few months ago but I feel like giving an update. When I came last time, it was for taco Tuesday and I definitely thought that this place gave off date night vibes. My bf wanted to take me out for my birthday so I chose Las Santas. I made reservations just in case--I don't think it's necessary to but I don't think we would have gotten the seats we did if I didn't. I liked our seating--we could sit next to each other rather than facing each other. It reminded me of that movie ""Date Night"" with Tiny Fey. Anyway, we were promptly seated. Our server came to take our drink and appetizer orders. I knew there was a drink called Not a Piña Colada but I didn't see it listed--it turns out that they took it off the menu but they still made it for my bf. I got the Rosada Negra--it's frozen and delicious (after taking a sip of my bf's drink, I decided to get one for myself). For appetizers, we got the chips and salsa and coconut shrimp. I like that they give a variety of salsas and the chips were not too salty. My bf was all over the coconut shrimp. For entrees, I got the churrasco with yucca fries and avocado salad and he got the salmon with truffle mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes and Okinawa mashed purple potatoes. My steak was cooked perfectly and the salmon was really good.

All that for a burrito, I still ordered it hoping I would be overstuffed but it was much smaller than I expected, like the size of a wrap. What I especially didn't like was after paying $22, I asked if I could have any sort of hot sauce/salsa for the burrito, as most places automatically serve, they charged extra for that too!

Elizabeth P.,/user_details?userid=aSA946gb7ZAAYqXFwWbtlA,"Queens, NY",3/4/2022,2.0,Really wanted to like this place. The location is great and central to transportation and the space is nice   If you're looking to have drinks for happy hour this is your spot. If you're looking to have dinner this is not your place. The guacamole was cold and pre made looked more like a mousse or something you buy prepackaged in a store than something that is made in house for a Mexican themed restaurant. The sangria was watery and had more ice than sangria the liquor was almost non existent in the pitcher ($45) definitely not worth the price for the quality that was served. The pros - service was fast and attentive the staff was friendly. Will return only for happy hour (ie beer or wine but def not a cocktail bc likely expect it'll be watered down).,https://www.yelp.com/biz/las-santas-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Started off with their mezcal mule, which was nice and smoky, a cool twist. Our table split the guac and queso to start. Guac was great, and they even give you fresh jalapeños so you can control spice level. Queso was delicious, huge chunks of chorizo and great flavor. It can get a bit tough to get a good dip as chips tend to break and cheese sticks together so you'll want to have fork and knife handy. Then I tried the cucumber mezcal which was even better than the mule. Super refreshing taste. Finally the star of the meal was the fajitas.

I'll be trying the pina colada next time since I see a lot of people ordering that with their meal. The corn and peppers are YUM. Guacamole portion is a bit on the smaller side but still tasty. The soup is FAB. Will definitely get that again especially as it gets chillier through the months. The tacos come with 2 in a order which is perfect for me since I can never finish 3 plus all the apps! Fish taco is . Not overly fried. Fish is flaky and not too much breading. The carnitas taco is heavier but good; with a lot of meat and fried pork rinds on top for a nice crunch! Flan is good but on the richer side. I'll try the churros next time. So glad this place is a short walk from our apt!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/las-santas-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The guacamole was fresh however,  I prefer my guacamole to be mashed not chunky. The guacamole had a nice zesty flavor from the lime juice. My best friend said the chicken quesadilla was good and that avocado crema ?? (light green sauce) was really good. I added that on top of my steak. I ordered the Paloma which was made with fresh grapefruit juice. This drink was so refreshing and had the right amount of tequila.

Would say the fish was the best and the steak was awful. I was happy to see a lot of meat in it, but the taste just wasn't at the level it should be, and there was a lot of fat.

Jose P.,/user_details?userid=sxq3gD_1qC2MJZ6I2RVnVg,"New Rochelle, NY",11/29/2019,1.0,"I made reservations for Thanksgiving for a  group of four days in advance. I received confirmations, emails, and alerts about my confirmation. I was told that a table for four would be reserved for 5:30 P.M. . When we arrive some lady comes out and says we have to leave because they are having a private party. I showed her the reservation and she gets upset and calls the bartender over. He tells us that we have to leave because they are technically closed and I tell him that we have reservations. The bartender tells us that we are mistaken and that we have to leave. I asked for the manager and minutes later some guy comes out. I ask if he is the manager and then ask for his name. He tells me my name is Robert and I am the manager what's the problem. I asked him for his last name and he tells me that Robert is sufficient and we must leave because they are having a private party. I tell him the website says the restaurant is OPEN and I show him my reservations and the emails, confirmations and alerts. Robert tells me that's a mistake and we cannot stay that we have to go somewhere else and he would call me later, what ever that meant. I made reservations to avoid the shopping, preparation, cooking, and cleaning this Thanksgiving.

I came here last weekend and the outside was beautifully done with plants and tiki torches, it really give a great vibe. The service was great also they were very attentive & always nearby. The food & drinks were great as well. this place is literally immaculate, the servers are wearing masks and gloves (which I saw them change often) & the establishment itself was also very clean.

We decided to give it a try even though it was new and were we happy we did. This was one of those kinds of meals where after every single bite you put in your mouth, from beginning to start, everyone can't stop saying how good it is. The food and drink were SO fresh and the flavors were out of this world. Some standout dishes were the empanadas, shrimp ceviche, tortilla soup (best that I've ever had) and the enchiladas with the dreamy mole sauce. We cannot wait to bring others back with us!! The best part of it all was that the prices were so reasonable for such top notch, authentic food.

Erica G.,/user_details?userid=rXkHN3upJNVPiG9yJjytaw,"Brooklyn, NY",2/24/2020,3.0,"Came here for Sunday brunch with some friends for my husbands birthday. We were surprised to find how empty the restaurant was for that time slot... Including ourselves, there was only one other table of guest. First I want to say that the service was good and the overall decor and cleanliness were nice. However the food on the other hand was a little lackluster. Our bowl of guac which was $13 (a little pricy even for NY standards) was 75% tomatoes and onions. There was barely ANY actual avocado! I reminded me more of a salsa than a guacamole. That is NOT acceptable in the slightest especially for how much they charged! I have honestly never experienced a restaurant to be that cheap with their guacamole. For entrees two people order tacos and the other two ordered quesadillas, both of which were bland. I was able to taste more cheese than actual steak in my quesadillas :( Overall I wouldn't come back as there are tons of better Mexican restaurants in NYC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/las-santas-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's not a place where you can book for the same day at least in my experience. Make sure you plan in advance if you want the date and time of your choosing. The restaurant is large and had plenty of tables. There is an outdoor area and dining area. The service was friendly and knowledgeable. I wasn't too crazy about the tuna tostada or the lettuce elote. The barbacoa lamb tacos were delicious. I also enjoyed the chips and salsa + guacamole. The cocktails were also amazing. The music was weird too, it just didn't fit the ambiance. It went from Lady Gaga to some Latin songs and other random songs.  The bathroom was a vibe though! It was like being in a disco. The food is not authentic Mexican so that was disappointing for me. I really wanted to like this place and I heard many great things however it didn't live up to the hype for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxomoco-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Beautifully decorated interior. Prices are higher than your average taco shop, but the tacos were all unique. We started with a fried tortilla with several dipping sauces, which was flavorful and went well with the tacos as well. Each order of taco comes with 2 servings. 3 tacos per person was fulfilling. The arrachera flank steak taco was the showstopper with charred thinly sliced steak, cubed cheese and salsa which all paired perfectly.

We got the chilaquiles as an appetizer, and oh my goodness it was delicious. Hands down the best thing. You have to order this. For our entrees, we got the steak tacos and the egg/chorizo burrito. The steak was super tasty, but it had some type of oil (I think chili oil) on it and that made the taco super soggy. I wasn't a fan. I ended up eating the taco contents with my fork and skipping out on the oil saturated tortilla. My fiancé liked the burrito, but it was nothing special.

Elianny S.,/user_details?userid=N6ueKL89iKXG1i78XKbGdg,"Astoria, NY",2/11/2022,4.0,I've been here twice now and I think would describe the food as innovative and higher end Mexican cuisine. This place was awarded a Michelin star shortly after they opened and I can see why as they serve an upgraded modern version of traditional Mexican food. The food could be improved by adding just a bit more seasoning to enhance the flavor of the food. The lamb barbacoa tacos were really good as well as most of the seafood appetizers we tried. The tuna tostada was one of my favorites. The tuna with crickets was an interesting concept but the crispness of the insects did not really go well. The drinks were all really good and the service was friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend trying this place out as it's a nice change from the typical Mexican restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxomoco-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Came on a Monday evening and still needed to make a reservation because they're so popular lol. We split 2 different tacos (the lamb one and swordfish) very well done like I love the corn tortilla. You must try the guac and they offer to give you more chips too! I had a mock tail which was guava based and citrusy (more of my favorite flavor) and their dessert which was this delicious brownie with espresso ice cream haha. We were so stuffed by the end of it all. Great service and I even got the Lamb taco to go cause I wanted it to have it for later.

Food we got was not that positive. Peanuts is just peanuts nothing spectacular. Pints Verde Caesar salad with no flavor and very little dressing that I have to ask for more it was very dry.

Drinks took forever despite the bar being empty, and food continued to arrive to our table while some members of our party were still waiting for their drinks. No one really came by to check in on our food or drinks to ask how everything was or ask if we'd like anything more. The only time people came to our table was to drop the food we had ordered at the start. We never even had a chance to order more drinks or food and had to hunt someone down to ask for the check. The food was delicious but presentation for some was strange - the tuna tostada (while delicious) looked weird and off-centered on a too-big plate with no garnish.

Mahsa T.,/user_details?userid=FokgHC5GuMddOY-E5Qco9g,"New York, NY",12/19/2021,1.0,"Not sure how this is a Michelin star restaurant. There was nothing extraordinary about it. My local Mexican place has WAY better food. I ordered the chorizo burrito which is supposed to have chorizo, scrambled egg and potatoes. There was no sign of egg or chorizo in my burrito - all I got was a flour tortilla stuffed with potatoes and a spicy sauce. This is outrageous. For the restaurant to try to pass this off is completely unprofessional and I'm writing this review so that you do not waste your time and money eating here. Don't buy into the hype. The one star is for the tuna tostada, which was the only decent thing on the menu. Making everything super spicy so your mouth burns is not cooking with flavor - obviously this is what Oxomoco does to mask the fact that their food actually has no flavor. And they only had five actual entrees on their menu - five - that's all you have to choose from. I had to order a hot drink (Dulce Abuelita) because they sat us by the door and it was frigid because they kept opening the door to their outdoor seating every 30 seconds. What's the point of indoor seating if it's as cold as outside. This would be a simple fix for the restaurant if they actually cared and bothered to install a two-door system so the cold air wouldn't rush in every time the servers opened the door. We asked to be moved and there were at least three two-person tables open, but the waitress told me they'd have to clean one of the tables and then never followed up to actually move us. What a miserable experience and I spent $55 on Uber to get here and back and $59 on the saddest brunch I've ever had. I could've made a better burrito at home.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxomoco-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We started with a round of drinks and the Guava Margarita in particular was delicious. I normally strongly dislike tequila but this was a light, smooth and perfectly blended drink. The mango appetizer was one that I could have done without but was still tasty. The Tyaluda was a very unique dish with the best mole that I have ever tasted. The beet tacos were simple and done well but I felt like it had a bit too much parsley. The lamb tacos were definitely the best lamb tacos I've ever had and the barbacoa style came through wonderfully. The squash blossom on top of the lamb tacos was the perfect touch to balance the richness. But what really put this meal over the top was the chocolate ganache cake. The slight bit of sea salt and rich chocolate blended together beautifully. Completely worthy of the Michelin star and will definitely be coming back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxomoco-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Next, had the lamb barbacoa tacos which were so so delicious and flavorful! Last dish was the buvette. A bit Chewy but still good. The chipotle sauce on it was really good. Reason I knocked off a star was for service. When our waiter brought us the buvette, we asked him if we could run through the dish and tell us what was on it, to which he said ""I'm not familiar with this, let me get you your server to explain to you."" Uh... aren't you one of the servers? Anyway, one of the other servers comes and in 10 seconds just summarizes that it's beef with a chipotle sauce. This is a Michelin star restaurant.

Truly, there was something about everything that was memorable. The chicken was actually my favorite. It was at least half a chicken and still so tender, and the crispy rice it came with was super unique and made for a yummy bite in the taco. But the lamb barbacoa was also special with the squash blossom and watercress. This is incredibly well done, elevated Mexican food and I will be thinking about this dinner for a very long time!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxomoco-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Our server was on point, and the drinks/food were remarkably good without any pretension. Extremely fresh flavors from the tuna to the lamp to the peas.

Resy didn't show anything so I called and got a brunch reservation for the next day. When we arrived, we were promptly seated at a beautiful booth area outside. Plenty of space heaters and lots of space to feel safe. I love that they aren't trying to optimize for every seat. For ex they sat us, a party of 2, at a table for 3 and I saw other groups of 2 seated at tables that could accommodate 4. We started with some cocktails and my margarita was delicious. We got chips and an array of salsas to start. The chips were huge, clearly home made and omg the salsas and sauces all tasted so fresh. Next we shared the breakfast burrito and lamb tacos. They were both good but the Lamb tacos are a must have!! They were out of this world, so much flavor and the meat was well cooked and very juicy. The staff were all so friendly and down to earth. We didn't feel rushed and food came out quickly.

Zo H.,/user_details?userid=hgtyKQdPeK4pimLRMeeYIA,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",8/29/2021,5.0,"The service was impeccable, the food/drinks were absolutely delicious, the atmosphere was soothing, yet lively. We got lucky and were able to walk in without a reservation around 6pm in a Wednesday. We got the asparagus tacos and beet-chorizo tacos to start. Seems simple, right? Yet the flavors were so rich. Very unexpected. The tortillas were so flavorful you could tell they were freshly made, and the sauces were so complex. Then we moved along to the main course - roast chicken with crispy rice. Incredibly well done! Also ordered both frozen margs, which we were great (see pics). Now unlike some of the other Greenpoint establishments (Naked Dog, I'm looking at you!!) their menu is constantly changing. So impressive for a restaurant of this caliber. Now for the most important part - try their dessert! Really. Best part of the meal and you'd be a FOOL to skip. Went there a month ago and I still think about this strange custard dessert we tried. Not too sweet, perfect texture. No idea what it was but WOW.

Highlights for us were the tacos and the chicken.  The service was exceptional and super friendly.

Gabriella S.,/user_details?userid=gmoQqHowuSAOcvzBDk5IwA,"New York, NY",3/6/2021,5.0,"This was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Other than it being a bit cold outside, we had a wonderful time. The service was extremely attentive, and the wait staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and the preparation of the foods. They were extremely accommodating with my nut allergy, and made an effort to make everything perfect for us. I won't go into detail about each individual dish because they were all so amazing, but out of the things we got, the lamb Barbacoa tacos were probably a favorite. For dessert, they forgot to exclude the nuts on one of the dishes, and even after replacing it and having three different people apologize to us, they even took it off of the bill for us. The only note I would give is that we felt the dishes came out too fast, overcrowded our table, and our experience ended very quickly. We were out of there in a little bit over an hour, and that was with coffee and desserts. Would have liked it to have lasted a bit longer. But overall- wow this place is amazing.

Recommend the pork carnitas tacos with little crispy chicharron bits, brisk hibiscus tea. Taco filling is generous, would be nice if they provided a doubled-up tortilla for folks who like them slightly less filled, and could divide it up. Wish the location was a bit warmer. Mexico and its cuisine are humble, homey, unpretentious. This place and the staff both a bit too cold for me.
