The food was definitely made fresh to order and flavorful. I was craving oxtails. I had a decent serving for what i see places serve these days. I asked for my rice to side and ordered mac n cheese. Mac n cheese was good.  It was alot of rice and tasted really good. I'm not sure who created that meme that Jamaicans dont make good rice cause that's a damn lie.

Was going to order an actual entrée but the appetizers took so long that we didn't even want to order any more food from there. It isnt the servers fault since she was covering a bunch of tables but as the customer it isn't fair to pay an automatic 20% tip when the server was not attentive nor did she offer water or utensils for our table we had to keep requesting for something as simple as napkins. But they included tip automatically even tho it was just a party of 3. So yea might just order take out from here but never dining in. The ambiance was okay everyone was frustrated on how long the food was taking.

There is only outdoor seating, inside is only a bar no tables. 3. They advertise 90 minutes of bottomless mimosas for $40 on the brunch menu but fail to mention that the $40 does NOT include food. 4. The service was super slow. In the 90 minutes I only got two mimosa refills because the waitress kept disappearing. But when it was time for us to pay she made sure to HOVER over us.

Erin C.,/user_details?userid=XPfy0tSkgoGA2YNf-TXBzQ,"Brooklyn, NY",12/26/2022,4.0,"Sunday brunch for 2. I'm not sure if it's inflation but $28 for duck confit chilaquiles (add egg) is a bit absurd especially for the amount of duck that is in the dish in proportion to the tortilla chips. Flavor was good though! You do pay for the ambiance and it was just what we were looking for on a rainy afternoon. It was cozy, and we were lucky to get last minute seating at the bar. I've only sat out in the back garden before so it was nice to get this change of scenery. One thing to note, if you are inside, the kitchen is also open air indoors, so anything they are cooking, you will smell like it. Near the end of our experience, something was being charred and that really smoked up the joint and made us want to leave quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/colonia-verde-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Then check out Colonia Verde in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The menu is loaded with amazing plates like the Shrimp Tacos, Brussels Sprouts Caesar Salad and Duck Confit Chilaquiles.
