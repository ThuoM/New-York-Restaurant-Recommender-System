Love the flavor of their broth and the texture of their noodles!! The customer service at this shop is also phenomenal; the waiter even offered water for Miso! Best part, they have happy hour specials everyday from 3:30pm-7pm!! My boyfriend opted for the Tonkotsu Ramen ($9) and I got 2 pork buns ($8). We also ordered a side of chicken for Miso, which she thoroughly enjoyed. My boyfriend enjoyed his food and I thought the pork buns were delicious and well sized.

The noodles and soup were ok but the pork belly didn't have much flavor.  The place is small and crowded and a younger crowd.

It was very good and full of flavor. The pork belly was tender and full of flavor. The ambiance is great. The reason why I give it three stars is because the other types of ramen that my GF our family got were not as good. They were eating out of my bowl more than their own. They didn't have too much flavor and were a bit oily. Maybe it's better next time for some one else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/zest-ramen-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ended up sitting at the counter which was fine and a bit quieter than probably the rest of the restaurant. We came during happy hour which was great, and I ordered the spicy miso with wavy noodles. The food took a bit of time to arrive, but once it did, it was great! The noodles were perfectly chewy and there was a load of them. The meat wasn't very good though as it was hard, not flavorful, and thick; not the normal chasu. There was quite a bit of it though, four thick pieces. One of them was tender, the way it should be, but the other ones were really hard. It was also quite fatty, which I'm personally not a fan of. The egg was runny and awesome, but it wasn't flavorful enough either. There was one piece of fish cake, and lots of spicy oil. I liked how spicy it was! Service was alright as our waters were filled and dishes were cleared away appropriately. I may come back just for the cheap ramen, as $10.88 post-tax for a bowl of ramen is pretty much unheard of!

If there's one thing to nitpick is that the pork wasn't as ""melt in your mouth"" type of deal you could get at a different ramen place.

Makana and I had tonkatsu, his was spicy-chili (beware: it is just that) and mine, not. One more pork belly slice that most other places, fish cake (very thin, one more would have been nice), a generous amount of noodles (I was stuffed), and more, and this broth was simmered with love and attention to good dining. We had the purple yam tempura, seaweed salad, fried squid balls, squid tentacles tempura, pork belly bun: ALL EXCELLENT --and clams and oysters plated just as one would expect them to be: on ice and chilled to perfection.  The complimentary sake, served warm: of excellent quality, tempting us to try the other sakes: well worth the temptation.

Curated by Onjium from Seoul, there is nothing lost in their Michelin Star translation. Our entire party ordered the Tasting Course. It was out of this world. Each course bringing new tastes and textures to our palates. The staff was incredibly attentive as you would expect. The preparation for the opening was obvious everywhere.

They check vax status at the door and escort you up to the second floor. From photos I thought the ceiling would be higher but it was very pretty. Little slabs of wood were aligned to mimic a ceiling. We started with 2 different drinks which were all soju based. They had quite a strong alcohol scent/taste which took some getting used to but got better as the ice melted. Then we were presented with the food menu which was immense. We didn't know what to get. We considered getting one tasting and a few a la carte items but you cannot split the tasting. There were too many options so we went with the tasting. I'm glad we did because you could sample their offerings. Everything was presented beautifully and overall, their dishes had a subtle flavor. If you like your food salty and flavorful, this probably isn't the restaurant for you. I don't remember everything we had so I'll highlight my favorite ones. The amuse was a refreshing vinegar drink which was followed with anju - dried beef, fried fish skin, etc. Would have been great with beer. Then we had a delicate seafood dish with a pine sauce that we both really enjoyed. It included half a scallop and a slice of abalone. We wanted to lick the bowl and get every drop of the sauce. There was a impressive  looking beef dish presented in a huge metal bowl. It was chewy but delish with the perilla leaf. For our dessert, we asked for the chestnut tiramisu which was HUGE. It was delicious but one would have been enough for the two of us. The tasting was $150 each and the drink pairing would be another $95. I recommend the tasting for a special occasion. The food and service were excellent.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/genesis-house-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The interior of the restaurant had a really nice ambiance as well, though the lighting was much darker than we expected and honestly I would've preferred a bit more light lol. They have a scannable menu and everything looked really good - I really appreciated the detailed photos they included for some of their most popular dishes. I ended up getting the cashew king dish (a type of stir-fry) with tofu & rice and my friend ended up getting the braised short rib udon bowl.

Sabrina C.,/user_details?userid=PKnSxFiR55WUA0BKySNnxw,"Seattle, WA",2/11/2023,3.0,"I ordered the Shrimp pineapple fried rice ($20) and found it to be kind of lacking in terms of flavor and size. It wasn't bad but the rice could def use more seasoning and maybe a bit of heat, and the shrimp honestly didn't taste like it was seasoned. I know these were NYC prices but I say the portion was pretty small because I don't think I've ever finished an entire order of fried rice by myself from literally anywhere but it was very doable with this one. I will say that there was a ton of shrimp in it so I guess you get your value through that. Everyone I was dining with did think their dishes were pretty good though so maybe it was just the rice that was mid idk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The crab Rangoons were pretty typical and the pork buns were okay - a bit too chewy. I got the red curry with chicken and it was so good, however, it lacked the spice I usually prefer. Despite that, the flavors were there and the portion was large enough to split into two meals. Everyone else got an array of entrees (drunken noodles, rice, pad Thai) and enjoyed their choices. We went as a group of 5 on a Friday and they had closed the wait list but we were able to get seated within 30 minutes of arriving. Definitely get there early if you have a larger group!

My friends and I (group of 4) arrived at 6pm and were seated right away on a Thursday evening without waiting at all, but normally, reservations are highly recommended as the dinner rush begins shortly after 6:30pm. You can access the menu via the QR code on the table. There are a lot of options for appetizers, rice, noodle, wok dishes, drinks, etc. We got the pineapple shrimp fried rice, park mor, spicy udon, and a seafood veggie entree with thai iced tea and lychee iced tea. All very flavorful and beautifully plated, and totaling about ~$120 (with tips). In regards to the service, I liked how attentive they were but they did kinda rush us by checking on us numerous times throughout the 2 hrs we were there (ie during ordering, cleaning up dishes, taking our cards for payment).

Meera P.,/user_details?userid=nrxgfV-QrMjjvGeqWIISQg,"New York, NY",5/4/2022,4.0,"Stumbled upon this place around 9 pm on a Monday night. It was one of the only places open at that time, so my friend and I went in for dinner. I ordered an Italian wine and was told they were out, so I ended up with a Cabernet instead. My friend ordered the coffee drink, it was not good at all, not sure why it's even on the menu. Our server was kind enough to swap it out for a glass of wine. The food, overall, was good but not extraordinary. We got the spring rolls, pad Thai with vegetables and pad Thai with duck. The spring rolls were very tasty and I enjoyed the sauce that accompanied them. The pad Thai was not bad but not the best. I prefer Up Thai's pad Thai. The decor inside is beautiful, but the seats are so difficult to get in and out of without knocking things off the table due to the plastic barricades put up in between tables. I understand it's for Covid precautions, but they need to be adjusted to be more comfortable. It also makes it harder to communicate with the servers.

The only reason i give it any stars was because the food was really good. One of our friends was obviously intoxicated and ordered 5 shots. We all said no to the shots and told the waitress no. She heard us and laughed. She still brings the shots. When we tell her we don't want them, she says we can't take them back. We told them we wanted to take the drinks back multiple times and they wouldn't let us. We were pretty upset about that but gave two of them to the birthday girl and two to the girl who ordered them and one was left. Literally none of us wanted shots. They came back with the bill and charged us for drinks we said not to bring. After going back and forth with them, we just had the girl who ordered them pay for the drinks ($80).

We are so glad that our cousins place is so close to this restaurant that I've been wanting to eat at since we were staying in lower Manhattan prior. The ambience and presentation of food is such a vibeeeee. We were seated outside in the patio which is a little claustrophobic but it was a o k.

The menu looked enticing and beautiful, so we prepared ourselves to be wowed. The food was decent, but I would not call it great, not something I would come back for. The chicken satay was a bit on a dry side, it tasted as though the marinade has not seeped fully through the meat. The short rib udon tasted very bland. The shrimp curry was Ok, again, not out of the park. The service was nice. Overall, if you happen to be in the area like we were and craving Thai food like we were, this is not a bad spot, but I would not make a special trip (and I have done it with other places).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Joanne L.,/user_details?userid=htJcrxtelar85UYX5OxkIA,"Washington, DC",5/11/2022,5.0,"I've been to many Thai restaurants in NYC and THEP is definitely among the best of them. We arrived at around noon when it just opened and got seated right away. However, the restaurant got pretty packed by the time we left at 1:30 pm. We got the THEP wing for appetizer. The sauce is really good, like a sweet chili with Thai herbs. Most of the wings are cooked well but one of them was a little raw close to the bone. The short rib Massaman curry was my favorite - sweet and tangy with a little spice, not as rich as other curries so easy to eat. The curry sauce came with onions, scallions, sweet potatoes, and peanuts, all of which I loved. The short rib was cooked well and super tender but was a little cold when it came as if it had been sitting out for a bit. The Kee Mao noodles were also good and did come with a lot of veggies. Our server asked if we want spicy (there wasn't a 1-5 level), we said yes, and it was TRULY spicy. We loved it but definitely check with the server if you have a lower tolerance. Overall a very pleasant dining experience and I definitely see myself coming back to try more dishes real soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My partner ordered the chicken pineapple fried rice, which was served in a pineapple. They're great with presentation of their food and decor looks good.

Nia D.,/user_details?userid=nM-_IpC2bNcMT0_2S8brfA,"Stony Point, NY",1/16/2023,2.0,"As someone who thoroughly enjoys Thai food, I was very excited to try this new spot. The ambiance of the restaurant is very trendy inside and out and instantly catches the eye of any pedestrian. Unfortunately, the way myself and my two other guests were treated upon being served ruined the entire experience. I understand wanting to check up on your table and see if anyone needs anything or if they're ready for order but this was NEXT level. Quite literally every 2 minutes we were asked if we were ready to order. Each time this occurred we apologized and and said we still needed a couple minutes. It got to a point where it was so over the top that we couldn't even have a conversation because of the constant interruptions. It very much felt like we were being rushed in and out of the restaurant. Our food came very quick which was nice but we were in and out of the restaurant in the matter of 25 minutes. The food was good and I'm happy to have seen they have Gluten Free options. However, I wouldn't come back and wouldn't recommend to others without sharing my service experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Unlike many crammed and run down restaurants in Manhattan this one is very modern and organized. The pineapple fried rice and pad thai there are must haves. They put the pineapple fried rice in a cute pineapple which gives them extra points! There is a reason as to why they have 1500+ review at almost 5 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The food itself was special, the pineapple chunks were exquisite and meshed so perfectly with each section of duck and each grain of rice!

Tala A.,/user_details?userid=xULXjsHMBQ2Xwfd5LfjY8g,"Sacramento, CA",6/13/2021,4.0,"The first stop we made to NYC was at Thep Thai for lunch! Nothing is better than our fave comfort food! Was recommended to check this place out from the Yelp reviews and clearly did not disappoint!  We went for lunch around 2pm, there weren't many people there so we got seated inside where it is so aesthetically inviting and pleasing. Very zen vibes. We ordered the ube dumplings stuffed with peanuts and despite the purple color of the dumplings they were AMAZING!!! We also ordered the coconut water and the passion fruit drink, both super refreshing on a hot, humid NYC day! For our mains we ordered the classic pad Thai with tofu and the pineapple fried rice with tofu. Again presentation was on point! Food came out very fast! Very aesthetically pleasing and clean! Now let's talk flavor, for the pad Thai it was classic however I'm not sure if this sauce was sweeter or if there was an additional ingredient to it, it had a ketchup like aftertaste, which wasn't that bad but sweeter than I expected for my pad Thai. The squeeze of like helped balance the sweetness out but it was a bit sweeter. The pineapple fried rice was beautifully presented, I wish it had a bit more pineapple chunks in it as I was digging through the rice for more bits of it as well as it had more curry like spices that perhaps I am used to. Overall however, I'd come back and order the same dishes and more again. Hence the 4/5 stars. The service is excellent, the food is clean, delicious and aesthetically please as well as the restaurant itself.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were able to take our jackets off on a very cold day. The service was prompt & food was great - we had the crab rangoon & curry puffs + special pad thai and garlic shrimp. Everything was tasty and the portions were very large. They also had a great happy hour, and we followed with specialty cocktails during dinner that were delicious too. I can't wait to come back to try more dishes; likely great to come with a small group too since you can share & try a bunch of dishes (trust me everything on the menu looked amazing!)

At first I thought there was no way they would keep up with the quality, but I was wrong! The food here is just so good. In the past when I worked nearby, I had ordered the lunch special quite frequently. My favorite lunch special included crispy gyoza and pad thai. I was disappointed though, when I returned to work after the Covid shut down,  sat down at Thep to order my usual lunch special, and they told me they are no longer doing the lunch specials. I had to leave and go down the block to the other thai restaurant to satisfy my thai craving.

I happened to came across it on Yelp, after trying to go to another restaurant on Christmas Eve, which was unfortunately closed. My friend and I were pleasantly surprised by the food. Luckily we got there when tables were turning over so the wait wasn't long. Food came out quickly. Surprisingly, we were able to partake in the lunch special and yelp check in special ($1 Thai ice tea or coffe). It was a full size drink and was very tasty! I ordered the fried dumplings with drunken noodle. Dumplings were crispy and the noodles were spicy, to my liking!

If you dine in, you can get an appetizer, soup or salad, a drink, and an entree for $12 ($10 if you do tofu). On a recent visit, I ordered the pad kee mao (drunken noodle) with chicken, an appetizer of fried chicken gyoza, green salad with ginger dressing, and a Thai iced tea, and was very satisfied with lunch. All of the dishes were done well, the portion size was just right, the noodles had a nice heat to them (but not overwhelming), and the salad was so refreshing. In addition to the good food, the space was nicely designed and really bright and open, the air conditioning felt wonderful on a 90+ degree day, and the service was friendly and efficient. I would definitely come back to try more (for lunch or otherwise).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Let me tell youknow, THEP thai definitely falls into the first category! Their appetizers and entrées are all innovative without letting go of the traditional flavors. I would 100% recommend the THEP platter because you get a sample of all the different appetizers they have from crisp spring rolls, to the golden sachets and tbe chicken /shrimp dumplings! All of which are pretty good and wont disappoint. As for entrées, the crab fried rice and the green curry.

When we arrived someone said ""we called in a reservation"" the host said ok and escorted them to the table. *shrugs* so they take reservations? The food is amazing but they really make you feel rushed. Multiple waiters and waitresses arrive to move you along with getting outta there lol. I think they do not have specific tables assigned and they help at any table at any time with the goal of turning the tables over quick. My husband asked for a dessert menu and said ""it's my wife's bday"" the waitress said we do not have anything for bdays lol ... ummmm, WE ASKED FOR A DESSERT MENU not a birthday cake with candles.

My friend was like I wanted that sauce!  You know what I mean, a slight sense of being rushed through dinner. I got the sweet potato pad Thai which was a risk I knew, unfortunately it was WAY too saucy and very sweet for my taste due to sugar in sauce not the potatoes. No veggies at all, Just a little egg and sweet potato. I was very disappointed with this $22 dish. I barely eat any and never finished my leftovers which is unheard of normally for me especially with Thai which I love.  I thought I would fix it at home with veggies and more egg to soak up some of the sauce-never happened. The dish repelled me in fact and ended up in the trash. The fresh rolls were good.  The prices are a little high for the quality.

Imani L.,/user_details?userid=o-p82Ej15htdHtASAtY_aw,"New York, NY",11/10/2019,4.0,"So I really struggled with my rating for this place because it was really great but there's something about my food experience that didn't quite get me to 5-star. The atmosphere was great, the staff was very friendly (came to check in on our table multiple times), the turn around for food was quick, and we didn't have one complaint. The food was also delicious. I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings, golden sachet, and Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles). The shrimp dumplings and golden sachet were absolutely delicious. If I rated my food experience based off these two items alone, it would be a 5-star. I could literally eat both all day! The drunken noodles were also really good. I guess this is where I get disappointed because all of the reviews RAVED about this. Drunken noodles are my favorite dish and I am just on a long winded hunt to find the restaurant that does it the best. The noodles were a little soft for me and I was wish I had more sauce. I also wish it included a stronger taste of basil and possibly broccoli. The basil that was in the dish had no flavor, it was really dried up and that boost of flavor truly makes a difference for this dish. Now, was it good?  Definitely. But amazing? No.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Angelina G.,/user_details?userid=G2ecVGWRf-55JcB5swpc3w,"Elmont, NY",12/8/2019,5.0,"Visiting this establishment the first time, our wait was quite long for a Friday night as anyone could imagine. This 2nd time here for us however, Yelp made the waitlist process very easy. We waitlisted ourselves on the app, then checked in with the hostess when we got there, went to Starbucks to get hot chocolates while we waited the estimated 20-30 minutes. I got a text that our table was ready before our drinks could even cool. We get seated and service was as quick as we'd hope it would be. We were starving! We didn't have to look around (except to enjoy the ambiance) for a server, wave our hands around or anything like that to get someone's attention. The drinks were absolutely delicious! Our appetizers came out quickly and were equally as delicious as the drinks. Then the entrees came and the flavor blew our minds for the second time around! They truly know how to put a dish together. I had crispy Long Island duck with panang curry and it came with jasmine rice on the side. The duck was so crispy yet juicy/tender at the same time! It was perfect!!! The portions were great, filling for sure! Leftovers are almost guaranteed in my opinion. My best friend and I were both too full to even browse the dessert menu. I'd like to return here to try every item on the menu, if it was actually possible.

Saba S.,/user_details?userid=_kF6_7BYk-8ObfDg1UB1kg,"New York, NY",1/22/2021,1.0,One of the worst experiences I've had with a restaurant! I reserved my spot for 5:30pm a day ahead on Yelp and I get a notification saying that my reservation got canceled after an hour or so. My frustrated self made another reservation for 6pm. Yet again I get a notification saying that my reservation got canceled. I took a 45min ride to Thep Thai for dinner just to know that I have to wait out in the cold for 2hours to be seated. I repeat 2hours!!! By far the worst wait time for a restaurant and there's no way to make reservations cus it'll get cancelled every time.

The prices are reasonable and pretty large portions as well. Started with the Tom Kha soup and it was delicious, plenty of flavor, lots of lemongrass aroma and flavor and that coconut flavor  mmmm so good.

As Thai restaurants go, this was one of the best I have been to. The service was prompt and the food came out fairly quickly. I had the crab Rangoon wontons as a starter. The contrast of the crap and cream cheese was super yummy. It came with a very delicious dipping sauce. I also had the pineapple fried rice with shrimp. The presentation was amazing! It came in a pineapple shell. My dinner companion had the PLA ABB which is tilapia wrapped in banana leaves and it also had an amazing presentation. The waitress asked him  if he was ok with spicy and he said yes. Boy was he wrong. There was sooo much spice, but the flavors were very good. I took one forkful and instantly regretted making that decision as I do not spicy food at all! If you're not of the faint of heart, that dish is for you. For our drink selections, I had a delicious glass of Thai iced tea, and my companion had a very refreshing cocktail.

Keerthi V.,/user_details?userid=svyVKwAJkkbhJjGhnLoBWw,"Washington, DC",6/13/2018,4.0,"Yum Thai food on a chilly NYC evening. I ordered pad thai with soft tofu to go. The pad thai was pretty sweet and had crushed peanuts. It was very good as leftovers. The tofu was a little bland, and the noodles were a little dry. I think pad thai sometimes gets like that when you order to go because the food is hot and sitting in a plastic box so some of the moisture gets out? Not sure if that's a real thing but pad thai always seems to taste a little dry when I get it to go. The restaurant was really tiny and packed with people. We picked up our food on the way home and it was so cool to see the layout of the restaurant and how they fit so many people in one little area. Bae ordered a vegetable medley dish with tofu and really liked his dish. He ate it all in one sitting. He got a really good portion of veggies and he got the red rice with the dish. I had some of his veggies and really liked them. I think I got more food but it was mostly all noodles and some tofu and toppings, carb heavy. I was happy with mine and ended up having leftovers.

The only bad thing I have to say about this place is the drinks and wine. They shouldn't be serving cocktails for $13+ with well liquor, and the bottles of wine are completely overpriced ($15+ over priced!). Grocery store wines at steakhouse prices. Very unusual to see a Thai restaurant with alcohol prices like this.

Dia Q.,/user_details?userid=09estwC7eB2DCqaNdiE96g,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",10/14/2018,1.0,"So my friends and I went here to celebrate my best friend's birthday and the servers were being very RACIST, RUDE, AND INAPPROPRIATE.  One of my friends came early and asked for a table for us and the hostess told her to come back with everyone and we will have a table. When we all got there, she told us that it was not a proper reservation and took down her name and number then told us it was a 30 minute wait. So we said ok and took a walk and came back. She proceeded to say that a group was finishing up and it should be another 10 minutes.  10...20...30...40...60...90 minutes later we finally got a table after waiting for so long in the cold. Every server except for one male waiter gave us dirty looks. Now we took into notice that we were the only group of black young women in that entire resturant. The food was ok when we ate, but when it came time for the check they gave us more problems. Now we calculated everyone's part correctly and did the math more than once. They  came back to us four or five times telling us that we underpaid. WE OVER PAID THEM BY $60 AND THEY KEPT GIVING COMPLICATIONS. After we overpaid them, two of my friends went to the bathroom and two of us were sitting at the table. The same rude hostess from before came and asked us to wait at the bar because another group needed the table. By this time we were annoyed because thet were rushing us out after they had us WAITING 90 MINUTES FOR THE TABLE. The part that irritated us was that the other groups in the resturant were doing that and they werent told to move, but we had to move and we havent been there as long as they have. Before the hostess got a reply from us, she grabbed my friend's to go bag from her hand and DROPPED IT ON THE BAR. We went outside because we needed to calm down and when the rest of our group came out we left.

THEP is my new favorite Thai spot. It's a bit pricey than your average Thai place but the food quality is so much better. In Thailand, we would get pad thai in an egg crepe on the street for $3. At THEP, you pay $26 for pad thai in an egg crepe, though it also comes with squid, gigantic prawns, and green apples. A bit pricey though it is hard to find pad thai in an egg crepe in NYC. The regular pad thai is only about $15 so we will definitely do that in the future. I also had the khao soi which was arguably better than any khao soi I had in Chiang Mai! It was creamy with tons of flavor and noodles were perfectly cooked. I was able to switch out the chicken on the bone for tofu which was fantastic. The tofu was so soft and flavorful in the broth.

Dee R.,/user_details?userid=epYz9sQNOaBQ1Jz9JboqiQ,"Manhattan, NY",10/19/2019,4.0,"This is a very solid choice for Thai food on the upper east. They have all the classic Thai dishes that one expects at a Thai restaurant, but also some special dishes which are not typically finds. We had a shared platter of a sampling of appetizers.  These were mostly fried and two pieces of around 5-6 apps.  This was a great way to taste a variety of things and nice way to start off the meal with drinks.  We got two separate entrees- rice and noddle dishes- both pleasantly served and top notch.  They have an extensive list of cocktails and speciality drinks as well as wine and I think beer.  Service was attentive.  The only drawback I found was that it is very very loud (crowded night although we went early and music too loud ). More mellow background music to not compete with the noise of people would be much better atmosphere.  It was difficult to relax and have a conversation at times. Also it is a bit cramped. So I would be hesitant to come back during prime evening times.  They do delivery as well and lunch specials so that's always a great option.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/thep-thai-restaurant-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The service was very attentive throughout the meal including making sure we had water, asking about needing more drinks and checking on if we liked our dishes. I hope this continues and it isn't just a ""new restaurant"" approach. Its definitely a differentiator. I got the pork buns to start which were great and tasty.

Lilli S.,/user_details?userid=-UA3I1NQIdLZSy7ZHrJNKw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/21/2022,5.0,"I saw that the photos were beautiful on Yelp but this place is absolutely gorgeous beyond the expectations set. Tucked away in an oasis on Christie street, past a secret garden, then behind these two impressive escalator space portals to the hotel above. Both the bar/lounge and restaurant have plentiful, beautifully designed seating. And the entire establishment is adorned in greenery. It's like the rainforest cafe for sophisticated adults and unsophisticated foodies like me. I had to get the Popular Pisco Sour because when in Lima... one of the best cocktails I've ever had. I also had to try the classic ceviche which honestly blew my mind - the broth? Was so delicious and almost had a delicate chorizo flavor. The dish itself, all the dishes are absolutely beautiful. For entrees we got the shrimp rice which comes served in skillet, the sticky prawns (bigger than photos suggest! Definitely entree sized), the swordfish, and the market fish (striped bass with micro green salad and delicious sauce). We also got an order of yucca for the table (served two ways, fried and boiled? With another delicious sauce). The swordfish was my favorite entree - out of all the swordfish I've had, this somehow packed double the flavor. And since the fish plates come with just the fish (and a lot of garnish) - I would definitely recommend ordering some carbohydrates off the veggie section of the menu, and I do highly recommend the yucca which is just melt in your mouth. For dessert we tried the Neapolitan ice cream - my father in law is the number one ice cream fanatic and he was losing it at how good this flag of ice cream was. I tried it, it was pretty darn good and served really cool (in a rectangle). My boyfriend and I shared the baked Alaska which also blew my mind - covered in edible flowers and a graham-ish cracker cookie crumble, the meringue was marshmallowy and soft, piped kind of comically like the coronavirus (big spiky ball). Inside the ice cream was two flavors I couldn't identify but they were in the honey, graham-y world and almost cookie dough textured. It's a huge dessert, and I highly recommend getting it whether or not you have other people to share it with. Blown away by this magical place. It's expensive, but it's worth it! Also... not pretentious at all and very kind staff. I wish I had taken photos but I was too mesmerized. Excellent place to take a good friend for a birthday surprise :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/popular-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They were very friendly and accommodating on the matter, especially with bringing the cake to the back ($10 cut fee pp). We all started off with some drinks, I got the pisco sour. It was one of the best I've had in nyc tbh. Additionally we tried two of the ceviches, one traditional and I forgot the second. Also very good, with just the right amount of cream and lemon flavor. For my entree I had the sticky prawn. My friends adjacent to me ordered the scallops and duck leg. All three dishes were amazing. I wish the scallops were a little bigger but that's just my want overall at restaurants. Overall great good, music, services, and vibes. It was busy for a Tuesday night.

Worst E.,/user_details?userid=Xz6Zed2f_2VykkUkdeqOtQ,"Brooklyn, NY",11/17/2022,1.0,"Worst NYC restaurant experience ever. 0 stars. I was staying at the Public for a staycation and decided to have breakfast at the hotel before going home. The server and busser/runner working were absolutely lovely! The person I'm guessing was managing was THE WORST. I was there last Sunday (11/13) around 10:30am. Everything started out fine with the server. I ordered the bread and pastry basket and a side of eggs. When the runner dropped off the food, I was surprised by the bread and pastry basket (picture attached). I was underwhelmed and wanted to ask if I could get something else instead. I tried to get the runner/busser's attention but I figured someone would be back to check on me and I was hungry so I started eating the eggs (they were not warm but as I mentioned, I was hungry). I didn't see the server and the runner was busy but someone else came out on the floor who seemed to be the manager (I'll be referring to him as the manager) so I tried to get his attention. He was focused on a couple who had seated themselves (it wasn't very busy but the staff was struggling to manage the flow of guests). He told them ""I see you've seated yourselves."" They responded by asking if they could have coffees and he told them ""if you want coffees you can go over there. This is a full breakfast menu."" They responded by saying ""yes. This is where the hotel breakfast is?"" They had two packages of unopened cookies they had set on the table and he said ""this is a full breakfast menu and you can't have outside food in here."" Their response ""oh sorry."" They put the cookie packages away as the manager walked away from them. The runner came back and took their order. I was able to get the runner's attention and explain to him that I'd like something else. He took the bread and pastry basket away. The manager immediately came over and said ""We don't just order things and decide that we don't want them so I'm not going to be able to take this off your check. I can't resell this."" I hadn't asked him to and he didn't ask me what the issue was. I told him ""I understand it's wasteful and a hassle to send this back but I had expected something else. I feel like it was misrepresented on the menu and I would have sent it back right away had someone checked in but I was having difficulty getting anyone's attention."" He said ""Yes. It is wasteful and a hassle."" We went back and forth a bit and he ended by telling me ""I'll take it off the bill but just for YOUR future reference, we don't order things and decide we don't want them."" I have never encountered such a rude person in the service industry. I worked in NYC restaurants for about 8 years as a server, bartender, and manager. I know working the breakfast/brunch shift can be terrible but this guy was so rude to the couple next to me and to me. Also having worked in the industry, I know that ""we"" do send things back when they are not what ""we"" expected or wanted. I also know that it's pretty awful customer service to berate the customers. Having worked in the industry, I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt but this guy was BEYOND. He was so rude that I created this yelp account and felt the need to write my first review ever.

Very cool vibe, amazing food, creative cocktails, and excellent service. The ceviches are in my opinion the best in the city (try the Elegante) and the bar is a great place for a pre-dinner drink or night cap.

Raymond C.,/user_details?userid=kLWeVTrev9EOxwSOWZRhZg,"New York, NY",2/21/2022,4.0,"Booked a reservation for Friday night and was seated immediately. The restaurant is in the back of a hotel lobby and coffee shop/bar. The ambiance is very photo-worthy with all the fake plant literally everywhere. I got the scallops, ceviche, and duck. The pisco sours were very tasy and well made. Scallops and ceviche were awesome - a blast of interesting flavors and textures. Very fresh. The duck was just eh for me, the rice complemented the meat well and was stood out more. The lomo saltado is only offered for 2 servings so I passed on it. The wait staff is attentive. Definitely worth trying, but the price point is steeeeep.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/popular-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However, be prepared to drop some casssshhhhhhh!!! One glass of white wine is $22  and the Lomo saltado was $50.. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but i was definitely not prepared to spend that much on random thursday night. After dessert, splitting the bill between 2 people came out to about 100 each...

We have not had service and food this good in quite some time. First the hostess congratulated us on our anniversary, then Chef John came over to chat with us before our meal and was very personable and kind, then they sent over complementary champagne for us and our friends that was amazing. It was just a perfect meal and evening from the setting, the drinks (pisco sour), to the  food: ceviche clasico and nikkea, roast carrots were great as was the lomo saltado, all finished by the ridiculous pumpkin tres leche cake with salted caramel ice cream.

Stephanie R.,/user_details?userid=rydIkSm459kGv8whLWOUog,"Stroudsburg, PA",6/24/2022,5.0,"Ok first this restaurant is gorgeous. The decor really is eye popping. But what's important is the food it's to die for. Small portions so be warned but  the flavors are everything. I highly recommend the ahi tuna ceviche over the octopus ceviche. The lomo saltado was incredible. And the scallops were delicious. Salted caramel ice cream was so yummy. Now the service was everything we had Bowie he was super attentive, friendly, and gave us the best service. Our entire experience was positive from being nicely greeted by the host to being introduced to the beverage manager who was extremely nice! All the staff was amazing the food runner, and busser.

Wen Hao L.,/user_details?userid=yxtKZSK1qlHMnCgJmyc8SQ,"Flushing, NY",8/24/2021,1.0,Celebrated a friends birthday dinner. The restaurant decor is beautiful and feels like I'm in a tropical island. Food was just average. I wouldn't really be complaining if it wasn't for the service. The service was incredibly slow. Couple of us was waiting for water and drink majority of the time and to top if it off they charged us for items that was already included with our order. When mentioned they said they didn't know.

Mayra M.,/user_details?userid=zXP163EWBeOBujKkVYyTbw,"Commack, NY",5/13/2022,1.0,I tried to book a birthday dinner and was told if I had over 7 guests we'd have no alternative but to participate in tasting menu of $125pp which I think is horrid. How can you take away the option of a la carte. Also asked to reserve a table for drinks on rooftop and was told a minimum of $1500 would have be spect.
