No wait, surprisingly it was in Brooklyn. This place has it all. Inspired by vintage cinema, the restaurant/bar has a movie theater set up with seats and all. Vintage Thai movies are playing in the background as you enjoy Thai beers, sake/soju infused cocktails, or some wine. I came here with a party of 4 and was sat at a table within 5 min (the only thing good about covid is that awesome undervalued places aren't too crowded on a Saturday night). I instantly fell in love with the aesthetics and vibe. We ordered some of the cocktails. My wife got the perfect husband (hopefully not a jab at me), while I went with a Leo (Thai) beer. Hoping they serve Chang and Singha soon! While combing through the menu i started noticing dishes I hadn't seen in a Thai restaurant (within Brooklyn) in a long time. Legit authentic dishes ranging from Kao Mahn Gai (hainanese style chicken and rice) to ba mee moo dang (roast pork style noodle soup). I was in heaven. Feeling nostalgic about my dozen visits back to my home country, this brought back wonderful memories. I ordered the chicken and rice instantly and my wife tried the seafood laab. Everything was amazing. Not sure if they just hired the chef straight from Thailand, but it was every bit what I remembered. Also the price was a steal for the area with dishes ranging from $12-$20.

Donny H.,/user_details?userid=Ve8fZ4W05XG9Gw63j5IROw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/25/2021,2.0,Been wanting to try for awhile. Trying to try all the local places near my apt. Anyways the place was cute. I was alone and got seated in an old movie seat facing the screen. Then I saw people eating on TINY PAPER PLATES AND PLASTIC FORKS !!! I was like for these prices which are high I can imagine what kind of portions they serve. They were small of course. I had some kind of chicken wings which were good but served in a plastic cup!! So weird. I got a tiny cup of water. I even asked why are they serving this in plastic making more trash for landfills? Didn't get a good answer. The main dish was Almost 20 bucks. It was not even hot. Kinda warmish. Idk what Eater and Infatuation NYC saw in this place. My knees were killing me and so was my back when I got up. I had a slender bench to eat on and had to hold my plate under my chin to eat. The music was SOOO LOUD and annoying I wanted to get out fast. I left hungry and pissed. Also CASH ONLY of course. I had to VENMO to pay. Annoying. Place was filled with the typical annoying white Bushwick types. Anyways. I shoulda gone with my gut and PASSED ON THIS ONE.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mao-mao-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It has a feel of being in Thailand with the Thai cinema and Thai pantry. All the dishes are authentic street food and more (no Pad Thai on the menu, and that's a good thing because it'll challenge you to try something different).

Liz came over not too long after we sat, and personally wished my husband a happy birthday and thanked him for celebrating it there. The setting and mood was so extremely chill that we didn't realize we all sat talking to one another about an hour and a half AFTER WE FINISHED DINNER! We stayed until about 10:30 (they closed at 11) but were not rushed to leave or felt like they were pushing us out. We ordered appetizers, multiple drinks per person, entrees and dessert and the bill per person was less than 120. While leaving, Liz stopped us again and gave our son another toy car.

Every employee was attentive, neat, and polite. Liz was an absolute pleasure to meet and she was so nice to both my fiancé and I. You can tell she really loves what she does. The food was delicious. Next level. The pastry basket was a selection of warm, buttery and soft pastry breads with some whipped butter to accompany. When we tasted those, we knew the whole meal was going to be memorable. We ate the smoked salmon Benedict, done over a crispy potato pancake - phenomenal. We also had the Belgian waffle done with maple whipped cream and pecans and it was delicious. And we had the fried chicken sandwich - and now we know why that is such a popular menu item. All of the food was prepared to perfection, quickly, and plated very well! We tried some of the dessert cakes and they were absolutely great. The pastry chef (I'm sorry I don't remember if her name was Ellen or Helen), but regardless her high skill is very apparent through her work.

Adeline S.,/user_details?userid=t5gypD3F7_8CKf2Rfd4xzg,"Redwood City, CA",12/29/2022,5.0,"This is a long overdue but also recently well-deserved review of our experience at American Brass - I would count this as a double 5 stars. My fiancé and I had our engagement dinner here earlier in September and hosted ten people for a delicious pre-set dinner. My fiancé had done all of the planning with Liz and Robert for the surprise dinner; in his words, they were ""extremely thoughtful, accommodating, and attentive"" throughout the entire planning process and the night of. They did a truly wonderful job creating a personalized engagement dinner experience - they printed out our photos onto the personalized menus and also had our photos printed onto little packaged dessert blondies for folks to take home. Not to mention, the food alone was delicious. Now fast forward 3 months later, we decide to go back with a few family friends for dinner because, as I mentioned, the food,  ambiance, and service are fantastic. Everything was as remembered - delicious, timely, relaxed, convivial. At the end of the night, we were surprised by the most thoughtful gesture - a romantic goodie bag and a tray of blondies, including two packaged ones with our engagement pictures printed on! Liz came by as we were totally flabbergasted and mentioned she recognized us. I couldn't believe it and was just so touched by the thoughtfulness; and it truly made for another special memory at the restaurant. If anyone is thinking about coming here for a date night, an engagement dinner, rehearsal dinner, or any other special event, you can stop thinking and just do it, as the team here really does care about creating special (and delicious) memories for their guests.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/american-brass-long-island-city-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Miriam W.,/user_details?userid=G6NxE11r3lMuvyufmwi7fw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",3/2/2021,2.0,"We came here for dinner and we left VERY disappointed. The menu was limited and everything we ordered aside from the salad tasted VERY questionable. The steak did not taste like ""steak"" at all. It also came with this weird block of cold ""butter"" ( I wouldn't even call it butter but ok..) the fries were overly salted that you had to make sure you were also quenching your thirst at the same time. To wrap things up, service was also nonexistent. To say the least, the whole dish didn't make sense at all and wished we had ordered something else instead. Now on to the beverages, the so called ""drinks"" consisted of 2 sips since it was just filled with ice instead. Our bill was over $200 and no way was it worth it.

At first glance, the ambiance is excellent and the hostesses were friendly. The food was a bit too salty for my taste.

When we mentioned to the waiter, he apologized and sent the general manager to speak with us. He proceeded to berate us for not saying something sooner in the meal and took the rest of the bottle away without asking, still expecting us to pay for it. Was extremely rude and offered no apology.

It was not. For 2 people maybe. I was also very confused with the focaccia. Not the kind I'm used to. It was a mini loaf of bread in a skillet. It was good but definitely not focaccia. As far as the entrees go I was very disappointed in mine.  Everyone said their dish was delicious.  Mine was as well.  I ordered the grilled short ribs. I had these 2 little cubes of meat on my plate. One baby leek split in half and 3 of what appeared to me as tater tots. I expected a little more on my plate for $40.

Rita V.,/user_details?userid=Ak-7XU4YIbh_Zcw6UfPQhw,"Long Island City, NY",2/13/2021,2.0,"Ordered the burger to go, and requested it be cooked medium. When I get home, I find the burger was cooked rare. I call the restaurant to simply tell them and the first girl I spoke with proceeds to educate me on how they cook their burgers. One doesn't need to go to culinarily school or graduate with a food science degree to know when I burger is cooked rare or medium. All you really need is a history of eating burgers. The manager gets on the phone, and she tells me she has already spoken to the chef who is adamant the burger was cooked medium. I send a photo and they refund my money - but proceed to tell me I should order medium well next time. I told her no, your chef needs to learn how to cook properly. If I want medium, I'll pick medium. If I want rare, I'll pick rare. Customers are doing their best to help restaurants but this place is not doing themselves any favors with customer service.

Richard, Joey and Phil behind the bar are outstanding to chat with and knowledgeable about the drinks and food. Phil even went out of his way to highlight the menu with all of the gluten free choices for my mom, who has celiac. Richard and Phil also made me some delicious mocktails recently as I stopped drinking but wanted to enjoy something. Jose, is my favorite waiter.

My friend and I came to Bacàn simply due to the good atmosphere after a day of walking around Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The food was decent. I felt like the gnocchi could've had a bit more flavor and the bruschetta bread wasn't as fresh as it could've been.

The broccoli dish came with 4 pieces of broccoli lol. And the burrata had some strange fish on it. Burrata and fish - not a great combo. I've never not wanted to finish a burrata dish at a restaurant before. The polenta fries were inedible (they took this off our check which is kind, and we didn't ask for them to do that).

Melissa C.,/user_details?userid=kduAeDuQwUyuK4blsDTM7g,"Brooklyn, NY",2/16/2023,5.0,Hakata TonTon is my favorite izakaya in nyc til date. I've been here twice and it never disappoints. The food is AMAZING and the servers here are quick and attentive. I've never fell in love with a restaurant so quickly but this was literally chef's kiss.

Hirsch M.,/user_details?userid=XPIlIb1Gjkh3ud_Tif8K_A,"Wall Township, NJ",12/20/2022,5.0,"My girlfriend and I came to Cafe Spaghetti on an impromptu Friday date night. It's a couple of blocks away from her place and she had never been here before. We did not have a reservation, but we were lucky to be seated quickly at the bar. The bar is well decorated with quirky objects that facilitate conversation and make you feel like you are in a modern version of your grandmas kitchen. We ordered the Ricotta Crostini with truffle honey for an appetizer. The honey was thinly layered and barely visible but exploded with the right amount sweetness. Our bartender, Kyle, whipped up an olive martini for my girlfriend, which had an olive filtered gin concocted within the restaurant.  I'm not a gin person, but I took a sip of her drink to taste, as we normally do, and the martini was so smooth that even I would enjoy it.  I had a Manhattan which was, honestly, one of the perfectly mixed mixed Manhattans I have had in a while. Kyle kept us entertained by telling us stories of other concoctions created at the bar and connected quickly with us. For the main dish my girlfriend ordered the Orichiette with broccoli rabe, which she devoured. I ordered the Fussili with ragu which was honestly the freshest pasta I have tried in a while. The sauce to meat ratio was perfect. We ordered hazelnut gelato for dessert, which was made in restaurant and tasty. However, we will be coming back for the tiramisu! The bar has a massive coffee machine / espresso maker for serving up the freshest cappuccino, which my girlfriend enjoyed with the gelato. I ordered a hot toddy which I highly recommend. I don't like hot toddy's, but wanted something warm that wasn't cappuccino. Kyle recommended it and whipped it up quickly. Calling this the best hot toddy I have every had is putting it lightly. Definitely coming back here in the future! Would totally suggest grabbing a bar seat as some of the tables looked a bit cramped. Didn't get a chance to see the back yard garden. The seating outside was heated and everyone I saw in there looked cozy and unfazed by the cold.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-spaghetti-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered meatballs, romaine cesar salad, rice balls, spaghetti pomodoro, the ravioli, and chicken francense with spinach. The apps aside from the meatballs were pretty bland, didn't really get a ciao y pepe taste. The spaghetti tasted like salt more than anything, to be honest it overpowered the actual tomato sauce.

Anders Christofer C.,/user_details?userid=jxq5Zfnoie2l_yCCK1c4Lw,"Denver, CO",7/16/2022,2.0,Located very close to south entrance of Central Park. Seems like a super busy place at least on weekends. I ordered a bacon egg and cheese bagel....with tax it was just shy of $10 which I guess is to expect being this close to Central Park. However the bagel was tasteless - bacon was so over cooked and the cheese had no taste whatsoever. Even that it was expected that the price would be higher I still expected so much more from a NYC bagel. I would rather have a place like this charge me even more but I would get high quality ingredients and a bagel that actually tasting something. The positive thing was that even though it was packed I was in an out in less than 5min.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/liberty-bagels-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Care S.,/user_details?userid=9IDs1CoFj4Ak8wBsfkxV8g,"New York, NY",6/21/2021,3.0,"My friends and I went to Four Four South Village (East Village) last weekend. The restaurant layout was modern, open space and orderly, and the AC was strong. It was on Saturday lunchtime while McSorley's packed with a rowdy crowd, FFSV was empty both indoors and outdoors. The four servers were sitting and standing around, bored and lacking in interest. Well, no business...understood. Suddenly, I felt a bit of sadness. Being a long-time New Yorker, I had remnant remembrance from my childhood in Taiwan of these veteran communities. What a bowl of delicious Taiwan-style Beef Noodles (and other appetizers) meant was much more than the food itself. It reminded me of homesickness from overseas students and immigrants from Taiwan back in the old days in the US when Taiwanese-style Chinese food was scarce. It also reminisced an almost forgotten historical era timely preserved through homemade food tradition by a group of uprooted and dislocated veterans sabotaged by civil war. Four Four South Village will be quite an appealing restaurant for many New Yorkers alike if it knows how to introduce this interesting food history to broader customer groups. While doing so, expand its menus with different homemade Northern dishes well known from these veteran communities to accommodate various taste buds. Chinese and Taiwanese food cultures are full of history and legends. I want to see Four Four South Village flourish.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/four-four-south-village-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Bridget D.,/user_details?userid=HkLw7_mTQ13RJCFPcE9S1g,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11/17/2018,1.0,"My initial impression of this place was lovely: cozy atmosphere, great lighting and delicious food (the meatballs are perfection). With that being said, I've never been treated so poorly by management. My friend wrote a similar review, so I won't belabor the topic; however, we were asked to move tables and then asked to leave because we had ""been there for an hour and forty-five minutes and that's a sufficient amount of time."" To which I wanted to subtract at least fifteen minutes for the time it took for us to gather our stuff, prematurely close out our tab and move tables after they told us another group needed our table. Let me emphasize that we had a reservation, ordered multiple starters, three dips, a salad and an entree (oink), in addition to ordering an entire bottle of wine. We certainly would have ordered more, or perhaps a cocktail, but we were not given that opportunity because our meal was rushed and we were asked to move tables to ""finish our wine."" Again, we may have ordered more, but we were asked to move and close out our tab. I know New York is not known for its manners, but since when did it become ok that the paying customer essentially gets kicked out of an establishment for doing nothing but enjoying the food and beverage it serves? Unacceptable. Little Rascal, your food is divine and your waitresses are doing their best, but it seems the protocols they have to abide by need to be reassessed because moving people around like cattle and then asking that they leave because ""their time is up"" is no way to treat your patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-rascal-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Natalie D.,/user_details?userid=5kOFJMoz7e_-CjiO8wREUQ,"Manhattan, NY",12/15/2018,2.0,"This place gets 2 stars for the ambience and the chicken that was on my salad. Otherwise fairly disappointing. When we got there we were told there would be a 30 minute wait, but that we could sit at the counter and have a drink while we waited. We said yes, had a drink (I had white wine sangria, really good), 40ish minutes later we flag down the waitress and ask if she knows how much longer the wait will be, and she goes off for a minute then comes back to say that they're booked up for the night. Uhhh, seems unprofessional that you told us a 30 min wait before??? She says we can eat at the counter and we say sure cause we're really hungry. We all ordered their Quinoa and Kale salad with avocado and goat cheese, and added chicken on top. The salads come fairly quickly, and the chicken was soooo good. But the salad itself had seemingly no dressing, and a very small amount of quinoa, but a decent amount of walnuts. We weren't sure if they had added them in place of the quinoa, but walnuts were not included in the description, and considering that tree nuts are one of the most common allergies, that seemed a little risky to me. The ingredients in the salad otherwise were really good together, but it wasn't as great as I had expected, although, again, the chicken was incredible.

Cristina L.,/user_details?userid=jkRjbvfHuDopybklm95q2Q,"Bronx, NY",11/14/2022,2.0,"I came here for a business dinner and was looking forward to it but came out very disappointed. Ordered octopus as appetizer and it tasted rubbery (obviously overcooked) and had no seasoning. For entrée ordered fish of the day, which was rainbow trout. I asked waiter before ordering if it would come deboned and he said yes. I almost choked on first bite full of small bones! Inside the fish was filled of romero sticks! Didn't make any sense at all. Bottomline the fish tasted bland and wasn't able to get through because of fear of choking.  Also forgot to mention fish took 1 1/2 hr to arrive . It was a table of 20 people they were definitely not prepared for us. I ordered dessert because I was very hungry. The mascarpine which surely is not made here was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-baia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My partner and I were told the only thing available was the bar we said that's fine and as we're awaiting the meal the manager (I assume this as he was wearing a suit, he was a heavy set man with glasses, light skin with dark hair) comes over to the hostess to emphasize no walk ins only reservations and she told him we walked in but she directed us to the bar now this was very distasteful because why are you having a conversation loud enough about your customers that they can hear you.. After hearing this I decided to check their reservation availability and they had tons of reservations for the exact time we were there and the rest of the evening in 30 minute increments. The bartender was nice, meatball was delicious, pasta was good yet sauce was a little off, chicken was just thighs (it was decent), steer clear of olive oil cake it tasted refrigerated as it was hard and cold. Limoncello daiquiri was good.

Bob G.,/user_details?userid=zf4TjW4t8PQX9nKC4heGIQ,"San Francisco, CA",10/10/2022,3.0,"Living in NYC for over 40 years and having dined at fine restaurants over that time, I had high expectations for this restaurant.  Sadly, it fell short.  First the atmosphere. Osteria La Baia is beautifully decorated with high ceilings and a spaciousness that is appreciated. However, the noise level varies between high and deafening so depending on where you are seated, you will either be able to hear your guests comfortably or not. Now to the food. No doubt, there are highly skilled chefs in the kitchen. We ordered the Tuna Tartare, Vitello Tonnato, Lamb Chops and Duck Breast special. The tuna tartare was fine. It was 40% tuna and 60 percent avocado that was allegedly smoked but I couldn't tell. It was served with fruit slices and a small single sliver of toast. I would have appreciated bread for the tuna tartare but we had bread plates and knives but no bread on the table. The Vitello Tonatto was fine. When the appetizers were removed we asked about bread. We also mentioned that our water glasses were empty. A few minutes later, our bread arrived, the water glasses had been filled, the captain offered a complementary glass of wine to compensate for the issues. That was admirable but it would have been nice not to have the issues in the first place since they were simple. Then our entrees arrived. The duck was fine. The lamb chops ... well, none of the three were medium rare as ordered. One was medium, the other two were medium well. One was fatty but... they did have an excellent flavor and were nicely grilled. Then we were offered dessert and coffee. Our water glasses were once again empty but again, no one noticed. We ordered a dessert and were told that they were out of it. Now, if you are going to present a desert menu and you know a desert is not available, you really should mention it THEN. So we ordered an alternate dessert, the daily specail semifreddo. We ordered Illy Coffee that was on the menu and again, at the point of ordering, we were told that regular coffee wasn't available, only espresso or cappucino or americano. The dessert was fine and the espresso was excellent. Overall, a nice but noisy atmosphere; competent but inconsistent and variable kitchen, and the service? Well, I hate to say this but it would best be described as ""Careless"" and frankly, that is not acceptable for a restaurant at this price range. I doubt if I will be returning and I'd suggest that the kitchen staff look employment at other establishments where their expertise will be a part a fine dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-la-baia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

James S.,/user_details?userid=kJnbLIPdJ6QOu_USBdfuZA,"New York, NY",7/12/2022,4.0,"Great meal at Bonnie's. Squid ($17) were crispy and light. I don't have a wok so this is a dish that I can't make at home. The lettuce bed was not soggy and the ranch dressing was on the runnier side but still good. 9/10. The Cha Siu McRib ($27) was much bigger than a regular McRib at McDonald's. It is a full sandwich. The hoisin sauce adds a smoky flavor and the thick cut pickles are fresh and really help counteract the sweetness and richness of the meat. Be warned that there is hot mustard on this sandwich and it's not evenly distributed so you may get a bite that's much spicier than the other bites. A wasabi-like level of spiciness. It isn't as fatty and juicy like a similarly priced Katz's deli sandwich. With this price, maybe value isn't its strong point, but it's pretty well executed. 8/10. The sundae ($12) was a nice way to end the meal. It's very unique, as the fried malted milk pieces were something I'd not had before. Buttered peanuts added more texture, which was good here. Normally I am hesitant to add nuts to sundaes, for fear that they will hurt the roof of my mouth, but these didn't. They were finely chopped. Ovaltine hot fudge was pretty sparse. I prefer regular hot fudge. 8/10. Service was prompt and friendly. Surprisingly busy on a Tuesday night.

My favorite was the squid, perfectly crispy and super flavorful seasoning. Loved the chicken broth and the mushrooms and sticky rice too. The cacio e pepe was kind of a fun take but leaned more heavily towards being a faithful rendition of the dish. It was really good albeit maybe jived together less with the rest of the meal. The char siu McRib was tasty and prepared well I enjoyed it but I wouldn't go back for it, didn't really do much for me or add anything interesting. I would rather just get an actual char siu bun. The only dish I really didn't super enjoy was the stuffed whole trout. The flavors were nice but the meatloafy consistency wasn't for me. I got the black penicillin cocktail which was excellent. Service was great. My only real gripe is that their outdoor set up is not really suitable for cold weather. They have some blankets but it's not enclosed enough and the heaters just aren't strong enough for a cold night. Don't think they should offer the outdoor dining in the winter if they don't have the setup to make it comfortable enough. Loved the meal but sitting out on the cold definitely detracted a bit.

If you want culture and authenticity, Bonnie's is not that. The food and prices are fitting for the Williamsburg demographic: a group that has zero knowledge on Cantonese food. None of the staff members are Cantonese let alone Asian. If you want gentrified food that costs more than an arm feel free to go to Bonnie's. Objectively speaking, the taste of the food isn't bad, but the price for what it is is atrocious. These prices really makes the person believe in inflation that's for sure. Got damn walnut shrimp had oranges in it smfh. Better off going to Chinatown, flushing, dyker, 86 st Brooklyn and etc for more authentic food. If you wish to support TRUE culture, this is NOT it.

I looked at it and asked ""is that soy sauce? I could get very sick. I can't have gluten."" She checked and said yes and took it away. I then asked If i could have the dish without soy sauce and gluten free, she said she'd check and yes. She brought it out, I ate it, It was very good and then this morning I am very sick with a reaction. SO, whether the fault of her not being diligent or the cook not knowing what a gluten allergy is, don't go here if you're sensitive and could get sick. Because either way, they don't care.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/otb-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ron A.,/user_details?userid=wX9aPSddmNKwZZbaDytMvQ,"Boca Raton, FL",1/13/2023,5.0,"Way out in west Chelsea, which is decidedly not charming, you have Marcus Samuelsson's newest restaurant...which is stylish yet welcoming. Staff were all friendly and attentive...they were very well staffed, so anyone passing by the table cleared plates and refilled water glasses. Our actual server was both lovely and very knowledgeable about the menu and the components used, able to answer any and all questions. We ordered two small plates to share. The blue corn bread was skillet style and came with a sour butter flavored with a Japanese pepper spice providing a surprise back of your throat heat. The Seafood and Waffles was an interesting composition, but it worked. The mussels were chilled. The octopus were room temperature with a bright lemony note. The bass was fried with I believe a light cornmeal batter, as were the shrimp. All were atop warm cornbread waffles dripping with a maple syrup with chimichurri seasoning which worked to denude some of the maple sweetness. The waffle also had uni butter flavoring it as well. Three of us split the plate, but there wasn't three of everything so my wife and I split a rock shrimp. For our three entrees, we chose Roasted Green Garden Curry , H&T Roasted Chicken, and Corn Wrapper Snapper. The green curry had a delightful lightness brought to it from coconut milk and a touch of lime. The chicken had crisp skin while maintaining sufficient moisture, but more importantly were the crispy Brussels sprouts with a touch of sweetness from black currants. The snapper was a definite do-over thanks in no small part due to a brilliant lime forward salsa verde spread over the cornmeal batter. Dinner was a big hit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/hav-and-mar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The 7up shrimp is hands down an absolute must-order! The sauce that the shrimp come in might just be the best thing I have ever tasted. Pro tip: save the sauce from the shrimp and pour it over your garlic rice. Eat the saucy rice with the spare ribs and viola, best meal you'll ever have! Other phenomenal items include the pugita salad: the tamarind dressing is a bit acidic and the crunchy onions really balance the octopus. Make sure to mix up the salad. The sisig is amazing! It's covered in pork rinds. It might be the best sisig I've had in the city. The Filipino bbq chicken is also out of this world good. Again make sure to get a side of garlic rice. The sizzling bistek truly comes sizzling. In the middle of winter they actually had to open the back door and momentarily take the steak outside due to the heavy smoke. It's a super fun experience even though it's not my favorite dish. Aaand the shakes, they're not a must have but they're also a very fun addition to a delicious meal. I don't love mango and yet I really enjoyed the mango shake with the black jelly. I would absolutely recommended this place for a low key date night or a group dinner. FYI it is BYOB.

Similar to corn bread but with actual corn pieces in it & topped with a light cheese curd. There was enough leftovers for the both of us to take food home and the bill came out to under $90 per person. This place is byob so its a win win!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fob-brooklyn-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Blair F.,/user_details?userid=m2CsYPqYPSmPfJhL7OeBYA,"Syracuse, NY",4/19/2021,5.0,"We ordered the Bibingka appetizer, Filipino BBQ, grilled spare ribs, and the Kamote, pickled papaya and garlic rice sides. There was plenty for the two of us. We espeically liked the Bibingka which could have easily been a dessert. The BBQ was smokey and had a great char, really a standout.

Went in on Saturday afternoon where they only had 2 parties sitting inside with several tables open. We walked through the open door and were abruptly told to enter from the side entrance by the cook (?) which was literally the door adjacent to the open one. Not even a separate entrance but literally walking out to open a door next to the already open one. Weird but we complied. We waited for a few minutes until someone came out and we asked for a table and instead of seating us at an empty and prepped table in this half empty restaurant we were told to wait for 5 minutes as the server took one of the tables check and disappeared to the back . We're not picky people but the attitude was not it from the moment we entered and we just didn't feel welcome.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/fob-brooklyn-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Scraping the crispy pig bits from the sides was the best part. For the entree, we split the spare ribs with garlic rice and laing. The spare ribs, falling off the bone, were glazed with a banana ketchup. Garlic rice had just the right hint of garlic. Not a fan of the laing, which was sautéed kale in coconut milk - a weird combo.

The appetizers I tried were the sisig and the corn bibingka.

The Ube shake was delicious but sangria tasted nothing more than just beer. We ordered 3 main entreees, with some side dishes. The chicken came out raw & service was subpar. He was unapologetic, just simply took the chicken and said he'll have it cooked more. At this point we've cut into them already to see if they were both raw and they were. I'm surprised that the waiter decided to take the chicken back to recook it instead of a new dish or asked us if we would like a whole different dish. Never had that happen to be before at any other restaurant (and everyone can have a off day, even Chefs). However, the Chicken came back dry & burnt at this pt we gave up &left it as is and wanted to just finish dinner so we can leave.

Jennifer D.,/user_details?userid=4eFJzxORJbfZLJLNN1KKGQ,"Manhattan, NY",12/6/2022,4.0,"What an unexpected surprise! Was in Rockerfeller Center accompanying family from out of town to see the Xmas attractions. Lunch time came around and we wandered around to find a place seeking little or no wait and decent seating. All restaurants in the area are generally touristy, crowded, and overpriced; it's Rockerfeller Center, it's expected. Being with out of towners who weren't used of walking (normally I'd hoof it down to chinatown lol), we had to stay in the immediate area. We stumbled across Mr. Sun. Totally unassuming from the outside and inside. The interior decor is modern and minimalist. We stuck with basics for our food order: duck fried rice, shrimp lo mein, pea shoots with chicken soup, Shanghai shrimp rolls, crab & pork soup dumplings, pork ribs with house special sauce, edamame dumplings w/ black truffle sauce. Every dish was absolutely excellent. Highlights for me were the pork ribs (oh the sauce on those!...), pea shoots in chicken broth (tasty as f!), and of coarse the soup dumplings (as good as Joe's Shanghai). We were not rushed, the staff was attentive and kept our water glasses refilled.

You need to check out Mr.Sun. Their dimsums are all housemade everyday at 7AM by their dimsum chefs. Their chefs use to work for a Michelin restaurant. This is how you already know the food will be incredible. We tried their Shrimp Dumplings w. Crab Meat & Truffle Sauce. It was soo good, the shrimp was fresh and you can taste hints of truffle. We also love the colors. The dark black dumpling wrap had the perfect texture too. It was soft yet firm at the same time. The duck dumplings were super flavorful too! We highly recommend getting that. The seafood dumpling with pea shoot was really good too, the vibrant green colors were so appealing. The abalone sui mai were delicious as well. Sui mai is a classic, but you guys gotta elevate the experience by adding the abalone. The pig egg custard buns were my boyfriend's favorite. The bun was so soft and the egg custard was sweet. And they are shaped like piggies!! Cannot get enough of that. The peashoot with chicken soup actually tastes like chicken soup. It was so good. We recommend getting that vegetable dish as well. Peashoot isn't a typical vegetable we find in our local western supermarkets, so whenever I see it on a menu at an Asian restaurant, I know I have to order it We had to get the pecking duck as well. For two people, we ordered half a duck, it was more than enough. The skin was super crispy. It was not fat, the meat was super lean, we did not get any fat. Usually when I order pecking duck else where, the meat is super fatty. I waited 7 years to find the perfect pecking duck in NYC. Best pecking duck ever. Their spare ribs were so flavorful and extremely meating! They were bone lickin good. The star of the show had to be the Beef Tenderloin with Black Truffle Sauce. If you are a truffle lover this is your dish. The beef was extremely tender, honestly we devoured this dish in less than 10 minutes. It was THAT good. We are so glad there is an authentic Chinese restaurant outside of Chinatown. If you are craving Chinese food and in the area of Rockerfeller, walk around the corner and check this spot out!

The ingredients are a bit higher quality than what I'd typically expect from such soup and the flavoring is on point.

Jessica L.,/user_details?userid=5Jyj4eHRlZHtyEWEgT764A,"New York, NY",10/9/2022,3.0,Came to this place to try. The appetizers were really good. The calamari a little different from most places. The batter was already seasoned and squeeze some lemons on it and you don't need marinara sauce. The takoyaki had the right amount of sauce on it. Some places usually drenched. The skewers were done well. But the sauce was too sweet. The chicken wings fried very well. But too much sauce overpowered the chicken. The don was okay. And the ramen unique flavor to it. Not a bad place to try. But I did not like the height of the food was at the appetizer and then went down from the entree. But my ramen unfortunately was too buttery and oily gave me a stomachache and had diarrhea. Flavors good. But maybe too buttery for the stomach. I would come back for the apps and maybe a different ramen that's not buttery or oily.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-juraku-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I like that the vibe is not pretentious at all, and there's no need to dress up to dine here. They have the usual Izakaya fare but we only ordered karage to share. The karage comes with a big portion. The chunks of chicken are meaty but tender and well battered. I also ordered the black garlic ramen, which was on par with what you would find at a ramen shop.

I assumed chicken cutlet meant breast, but it was actually a slice of fat. I think that was my fault for not asking. The vegetable bao buns had two pieces of zucchini each. I think I expected something a bit different in terms of vegetables. We also ordered the oroshi karage, and it wasn't that crispy but otherwise good.

Cassandra S.,/user_details?userid=Rxz5ZnIy9D5fJhm725VGig,"Washington, DC",1/14/2023,4.0,"Overall, this restaurant has a lot of potential and I am optimistic that it is working itself up to being great. The restaurant interior is really beautifully decorated, and you really do feel transported coming off the street. The service is really nice too. The menu is really imaginative and thoughtful as well. While everything was plated beautifully, I think when it came to execution though there were little things that were off. In particular, the gnocchi felt like they had gone past pillowy into too-soft territory, the short rib was a little dry, and the texture of the overly hard chulpi mixed with soggy calamari wasn't particularly pleasant. The tiradito nikkei was phenomenal though, and I really liked the reimagined chilcano and Peruvian gems dessert. I'm curious to come back once the menu has rotated and see what this place is like with more time under its belt.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/artesano-peruvian-cuisine-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Excellent service, well informed bartenders that were precise and showed us how to enjoy the drinks and also the variety of Peruvian fusion dishes. We custom made about six dishes very similar to the tasting menu. Try the tuna tiradito style and the duck. The chicha morada dessert had me using my fingers to get the picarones sauce off the plate.

Make sure you have a reservation  - this is very important! Philip Guardione brings out the flavors of the Mediterranean - the flavors are from Sicility. You can choose from New York or Ibiza! How fabulous. Our meal came with bread - which was crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. We ordered some things to share - Spaghetti with pecorino cheese and black pepper. Our paccheri with lobster, scampi, and langoustine was excellent and the Ravioli Ossobucco was a hidden gem with an incredible balance of flavors and textures. We also tried the veal chop milanese which was excellent but not for the faint of heart - it can easily feed 2-3! Caesar salad - lettuce, crostini bread, shaved parmigiana cheese and caesar dressing. All so yummy. We ordered the tiramisu and they make it right there! The coffee was delicious as well. Cozy atmosphere for sure! Our servers were great and we will definitely be back.

The portion is definitely enough for one person; I even had some leftover and the little edible flower petals on top were so aromatic and a delicious surprise addition!

Even though we said lunch special gnocchi when ordering, the waiter didn't correctly inform us that the gnocchi wasn't part of the lunch special and then we were charged the regular full price.

Full of rich flavors, the complimentary bread was so fresh and fluffy with the sides (hummus, sun dried tomato sauce, vegetable sauce) which complimented the fresh bread so well!

Definitely recommend making reservations as it was crowded even with the rest of nyc being pretty quiet due to COVID. The menu is pretty diverse with excellent vegetarian options as well. The service is excellent with everyone super friendly! I ordered the cacio e Pepe which they mix in a cheese wheel in front of you and one of the foccacias which was also delicious.

We also got the Greek salad and it was very good and fresh, but I wish there were chunks of cucumber in the salad rather than just slivers of cucumber. I got the paparadelle with porcini mushrooms, which was ok. The sauce was more creamy rather than a mushroom flavor and the pasta was a little too al dente. My husband got the cavatelli with a lamb ragu and we also didn't love this. The pasta was too al dente.

We have had several celebrations at their tiny location downtown and wanted to have a great experience with more comfortable settings. We ordered the Burrata con Pomodorini, ( it came with arugula instead of basil as listed on the menu and was great!) good balance, Insalada Piccola, ( was quite dry and lacked the punch of a salad) Porcini Mushroom pasta, (Very Salty) Wild Boar Ragu ( Excellent and perfect balance of sauce to pasta), Spaghetti al nero (Too Salty and uneven heavy sauce, the pasta was drowned out), Grilled Sardines ( slight funky extra large sardines over shredded cabage and citrus fruit) and the star of the meal was Tiramisu assembled at table side! The service was great! I invited guests who have eaten in fine dining a nd great street dining all over the world. I really wanted to impress them with Piccola Cucina. Only 1 hit pasta (Wild BoarRagu) and 1 Antipasti ( Burrata) and the tiramisu . We had an assortment of coffees, espresso, cappuccino, American coffee and all were good with the tiramisu. Why too much salt in the pastas? I see other reviewers have the same experience. One other challenge was the noise level. It was difficult to have conversation. There is a hostess who greets all the tables loudly and it seemed when she was greeting the tables with warmth and friendliness it lifts the volume. It was nice to see families, groups of adults, couples, and great loyal following. I really wish everyone at Piccola success. The staff was great!! Service wonderful.

Shouli T.,/user_details?userid=n8TgUTVW8J6oZNYEKar0fA,"New York, NY",11/29/2021,5.0,"Loved this Italian restaurant. Such a great place to get pasta for dinner. Got a reservation on a weekday night pretty easily but the place was packed. They checked our vaccination cards and got us into a table. They started us off with some bread and a side of these three toppings (some kind of hummus?, carrots, and this tomato-ey spicy sauce)! So gooood. Honestly kinda started getting full off the bread itself. I ordered the tagliatelle in wildboar ragu with truffle. SO delicious. The truffle flavors definitely came through in every bite but there was also a large piece of truffle on top. The meat was scruuumptiously cooked and the tagliatelle was perfectly al dente. Husband got fusilli with scampi and burrata. It actually came with a lot of seafood in it!! The fusilli was delicious and the sauce was soooo good with the burrata mixed it. For dessert, we got the tiramisu which is made tableside which was prettty cool! Overall the cream was amazing but the server didn't dip one of the the lady fingers in the espresso long enough so it turned out a bit crunchy. Other than that, would defs recommend and would love to go back to try the other items!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/piccola-cucina-uptown-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ordered the meatballs and the octopus for appetizers - both excellent. The best part of the meatball dish were the incredibly tender mushrooms. Ordered the tagliatelle and pacchero with seafood.

Part of me wants to keep it a secret but then again, that'd be socially criminal. I don't normally do reviews but for this place I'll be doing tags on Instagram and tweeting it till it gets notice. How fun and authentic is it when you go to an Italian restaurant and the employees are Italian- the best. The warmest charm and welcoming people. I felt comfortable right away, and uplifted by their upbeat energy. So right away I was pleased but I had no idea I was about to fall in love. If you eat American Italian food- no more. You eat here and you can't go back to generic. I don't need to go to Italy now, I have this place. The food is rich in fresh flavor, I couldn't stop eating even though I was full. My mother and I ordered multiple dishes and we couldn't find a flaw. Do you know how rare that is? Couldn't rate anything lower than a 10/10. I'm actually bothered by how perfect everything was, because now I can't go anywhere else. Im from San Francisco on a work trip so I'm heartbroken over the fact that I have to return back to California. I know I have a 'little Italy' town to enjoy some good Italian food back at home but that's just it- ""good"" not mouth watering like Piccola Cucina. Now if someone eats here and isn't pleased, it's because they eat crap-no bs- they can't appreciate real fresh and clean food. I promise this.

Half of the patrons there that night were speaking in Italian and the manager (probably the owner) was absolutely wonderful, personable, warm and friendly. There was an opera singer from Naples, Mossimo, who surprised us lucky restaurant goers with a couple of beautiful songs in Italian.

Matteo G.,/user_details?userid=MZuCISR1ssi5PlGrHeusrA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11/10/2020,5.0,"Costly but delicious lunch at Piccola Cucina. The location has done a great job with their outdoor space by making it COVID-safe but still glamorous. In terms of food, similar to their other locations downtown, it does not disappoint. We started by ordering Arancini catanesi (2 for $12.95), Mozzarella in Carrozza ($11.95), Fritto misto ($18.95) and the Fugassa con prosciutto crudo di Parma ($21.95). Even though extremely expensive, the above appetizers were delicious. The arancini were filled with meat sauce and peas, the mozzarella in carrozza and the fritto misto were perfectly fried and tasty. Finally, the fugassa is a fairly large portion, very cheese and a nice treat. For main course we each ordered a pasta. 3 of us ordering the Spaghetti ai ricci di mare/sea urchin ($26.95) and one of ordering the Bucatini cacio e Pepe ($19.95). Both types of pasta were absolutely delicious. The cacio e pepe was super cheesy and the presentation was great since the pasta was mixed in an actual large cacio cheese wheel that was brought close to our table on a cart. The sea urchin pasta was also very fresh and you could taste the sea. Finally, even though extremely full at this point, we ordered 1 Cannolo Siciliano each, which was the perfect way to end our lunch.

We had a very nice lunch and all were pleased.  There is also a lunch special of select items at $15 at lunch time. We had two pastas (boar ragú and allá norma), grilled calamari, tuna tartar. Everything was great and well done.  There are a few items in the menu that are not very Italian (for example. Addition of guacamole with grilled calamari and tuna tartar). I think the menu items would be better staying fully Italian, but the food was well done regardless. The bread was very good with olive oil and a crunch crust that was served with the meal (along with a sun dried tomato spread). Prices are medium to higher medium.  The desserts were a bit pricey at $12 each so we passed. Had espressos. The staff was all very friendly and professional. Many from Italy, which was nice for my guests to talk to waitstaff in Italian.  I will definitely return. It had a very steady flow of people and seems like a popular choice.

But honestly everywhere else has gone above and beyond with service and food and here they did not. Getting acknowledged took a very long time. Ordering drinks took a very long time. When we arrived there was only 4 other ppl seated. We received our pasta before our drinks. The pasta was barely warm. Cacio Pepe was chunky and crumbly in seconds. We had to ask another server for our drinks. There was maybe 5 or 6 staff and barely anyone there. I'm thinking wow inside must be really busy because we haven't seen our waitress at all. I went inside to use the bathroom and saw her just hanging out behind the bar and the inside had no people at all!! Wtf?? Paying $300 for this meal and awful service-ridiculous. Will never go back.

My friend and I got seated right away. I would say the tables are a little small but maybe we ordered a lot of food lol we got the galbijjim and cold noodles combo as well as the gamjatang stew.

The meat seemed a bit dried out and hard to chew on. The Mul-Naengmyeon was 10/10 though. The broth was so good that I didn't have to add any vinegar, which people usually do to give it better flavor.
