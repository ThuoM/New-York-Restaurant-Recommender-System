Laura C.,/user_details?userid=cK_4Etqr3fVDg7LOty4xwA,"ELMHURST, NY",6/23/2021,4.0,First day of full service dining at Five Leaves was a bit of a miss. The reliable house made ricotta and the truffle fries was the saving grace. They had no Bellini's available and the French dip sandwich was not nice at all. It was cold inside and just fell short. Our server was new but very nice and tried her best and actually the manager removed one sandwich order from the bill which was appreciated. 3.5 stars is what this visit rated  but I gave it 4 stars because they were courteous and this was first day of full dining and because I have been here a handful of times pre-pandemic and had nice experiences.

I was really excited to try this spot for brunch so I made the trip to give it a try. It opens at 10am. I was the second person in line to order at the coffee window. You then go seat yourself, so it's first come first serve. I ordered a coffee and the ricotta pancakes. Even though I was the 2nd person to order for the day, it took a solid 30 minutes to get my food? Not sure why it took so long. The pancakes themselves were also a bit disappointing unfortunately. Pretty tasteless. The only saving grace was the syrup (which I wish they gave more of). Oh well.

Emmett G.,/user_details?userid=l2p2BOAZWjvOjPn0EXNMSQ,"Brooklyn, NY",12/5/2021,5.0,"We came to Five Leaves to start off a full day in Greenpoint and Williamsburg. Meeting up with a friend, we were seated quite promptly upon arriving, despite the busy atmosphere. We were first served our coffee (Americano roast to be exact), and we're slightly disappointed by the bitter taste. The coffee could be better. Coming in for brunch, we ordered two plates of The Big Breakkie, with two sides of Avocado and Bacon. My Big Breakkie was ordered with 2 eggs scrambled, and the they did a terrific job keeping the eggs fluffy and yellow (our friend got 2 eggs poached). The Big Breakkie also comes with these two hash browns which are unusually prepared with seasoning, but still delicious. One of us ordered the Moroccan Scramble, which has a lot of flavor. On the side for the whole table, we ordered Ricotta Pancakes, which turned out to be a real standout. The pancakes were real thick, extra sweetness came from the butter mixed with sugar. The pancakes also proved very filling, so it was necessary for all of us to share them. Service is great and the location has that distinct Greenpoint charm, I definitely recommend this place to anyone exploring this part of Brooklyn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Rasheedah A.,/user_details?userid=gKuurPSpdKrplvjoHio6zg,"Brooklyn, NY",6/9/2019,5.0,It took me and my friends three weekends to finally get a table at Five leaves..... that's how you know it's that good. Recommendation to get a table is to get there a little before they open as the lines and wait times later in the day can get super long. It's a quaint restaurant in Williamsburg that is really quite tiny in size but their food has big flavor. We had their famous ricotta pancakes and fish burger. The ricotta pancakes are light and fluffy and served with honey comb which adds a whole other dimension of flavor.... to put it simply it'll leave you wanting more. The fish burger was super flavorful and well cooked. Five leaves is definitely a place to visit if you're walking around Williamsburg and looking for something amazing to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nadia M.,/user_details?userid=hgHWYt3HwGOxtd3b63T78Q,"Brooklyn, NY",1/13/2019,5.0,"Brunch is a time to catch up with friends while eating great food on a day I remain indecisive if I want breakfast or lunch. Wake up early or sleep in a bit. Well needless to say I grabbed a bite with one of my favorite Chicago girls. We arrived a bit before noon and we were told that there was a 30-45 minute wait. Ok, no problem. I like shopping so we went in the store next door to browse around and spend some mullah. We came back and were seated right away. So, the biggest con I have for this place is the space. The tables are teeny tiny and there is hardly any space for everything you order. My friend snuck between the two tables to get to her seat. We were approached quickly by our server for our drink orders. I ordered the lemon ginger tea and the turmeric bees knees which was recommended by my server. Turmeric can be very bitter, but this was infused with honey, it was such a good drink. I'm a girl who loves her gin and I dont feel so bad since I'm getting all of the medicinal properties of turmeric. My friend ordered coffee and the drink with mezcal. She said it was really good. We then ordered the daily oysters. We weren't sure if they were going to be worth but they were. They were fresh the mignonette had fine pieces of scallion and there was another red sauce. Oysters were a thumbs up. However, now our table was packed. After the oysters came our entrees. I ordered the Moroccan scramble and my friend ordered the daily quiche. The Moroccan scramble had a lot of middle eastern flavors with sliced jalapeno giving a great punch of spice. I would recommend getting the perfect bite of eggs, sausage, jalapeno, cilantro, chick peas, avocado and toast all in one. The flavors work really well together. The quiche was made with a nice bite of salty ham and potatoes. It was good, no complaints. The side salad was a bit salty. We also had a side of truffle fries that I happen to love and these did not fall short of taste. Overall the, the food was really good. A couple next to us had the ricotta pancakes and she told us how great they were. So I definitely have to come back to grab a bite of them. We ordered another round of drinks and really wanted to sit back and talk crap, but our server asked if we needed anything else and we realize that was our hint to get out. I get it, there was a huge wait by now. So up we went to our next adventure. Everything was pretty good  I just wish there was a bigger space so I could feel comfortable eating without feeling I was going to invade my neighbors space. I guess you cant have everything. At least, everything else was good. I'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Caitlin R.,/user_details?userid=M4MER3UDoDmQ5RQWtfb7TA,"New York, NY",7/12/2019,5.0,Have been wanting to come here for years and decided to pop in on a weekday and was pleasantly surprised to get a table right away as you could sometime be waiting a while. I got an iced coffee and the avocado toast with poached eggs. This may be my favorite avocado toast in the area. It has the perfect touch of crunch and saltiness. I would HIGHLY recommend it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jackie F.,/user_details?userid=3-s9PizGBWO7W8HmVwjgmQ,"Brooklyn, NY",7/8/2020,4.0,My cousin was here from Australia and staying nearby I suggested we meet here based solely on the ricotta pancakes.

We got the Ricotta Pancakes: honeycomb butter, banana, blueberries, strawberries served with pure maple syrup.  Stacks of pancakes so high and so filling. It was delicious!  Also got the Big Breakkie: 2 eggs any style, has browns, whole wheat toast and 2 choices of size. I got over easy eggs and avocado and fried tomatoes as my side. Boy oh boy.

It was very filling and I couldn't finish them by myself, so I recommend sharing. They're the best pancakes I've ever had, but I will soon try Clinton St Baking Co and see which are better.

Malini A.,/user_details?userid=jew-E1NvGVcgoaXk1T0rjQ,"Enola, PA",5/26/2018,4.0,"Highly recommended by a Brooklyn local, we stopped there on a Thursday afternoon. The place was packed - had indoors as well as some outdoor seating. Opted for indoor but the noise level was so high, and it was difficult to even hear each other among the two of us. The seating also is very limited and tight inside because of lack of space.  So we just ordered takeout and went and had in the McCarren park located just diagonally across the red light intersection. Ordered the Black Rice pudding and spicy chicken sandwich which were delicious, and the portions were ample. Black Rice pudding had coconut yogurt, pineapple and basil, a little sweet as expected but was lovely and a good choice. Loved the food so much that I went there next day as it was opening up and had their avocado toast and coffee for breakfast. The toast was so crispy , presented well and was a winner overall. Staff is friendly. Also early in the morning it was a prefect place to just sit outside and watch the outside activity and start the day with such a satisfying toast. Overall a good café to try if one doesn't mind the wait.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Hypno T.,/user_details?userid=iSIrzDdslgciKKKRvHdBDA,"Brooklyn, NY",8/23/2017,2.0,"Probably the most overrated place to eat in Brooklyn. It's not that the food is awful, it's just over priced and over hyped. Sure, eat if it's quiet, but to be honest there's plenty of better food in the area. Service suffers from the typical problem places like this have; snobby staff with elitist attitude. Simple solution is a low tip (because it's not the customer's responsibility to make up for the crap wages 'just because') but it's not worth the trouble. Also the experience is ruined by being 'that place' people recommend to out of towners. Kind of like the old Clinton Street Bakery which was also all hype, average food. Save your time.

Service was okay, a bit slower than what I expected. Very small inside but cute, typical, brooklyn, hipster-ish place. It also has a few tables outside but it was a hot day. But the food, OMG!!!!! My cousin had the avocado toast which was visually appealing and she said it was good. bUT OMG the ricotta pancakes... OMG ... Were AMAZING. I usually tend to go for the plates that have somewhat of a reputation/hype and this definitely lived up to it. It was visually very appealing and mu taste buds were going crazy. Looks small but pretty filling, at least for me cause I don't take in too much.

David K.,/user_details?userid=_x3aaJ4JH8KwhC0ZYReSBg,"Flushing, Queens, NY",4/19/2019,1.0,I'm not sure if people have the same experience as us. It took over half an hour to receive our food. What was more frustrating was that people around us who ordered the same food after us were being served before us. When we checked up on the status of our food the waitress was unapologetic. Waitress did not come once to check on us. I don't think I will be dining here again. I cautiously say this but maybe we were being discriminated for being Asian because I don't see what reason there was for us such poor service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Just to be clear, I do and have accepted that as part of eating out but shelling hefty tips for shitty service I will no longer accept.

Sadly, the food is pretty good...for whatever reason I was repeatedly treated so rudely I got my food packed to go. I cant stress enough how rude this waitress was from how she handed plates to me to not even asking if I would like a refill on wine. Even the minimal standards of service were gone...checking even once on my table...I left feeling so uncomfortable and the entire experience was offputting.

They have outdoor seating, which was convenient for us because we brought our dog. They had outdoor tables, but only a couple of umbrellas to block out the sun. I don't know what it is, but I always eat out on the hottest days, so I wish I was sitting under an umbrella. The tables were so close to each other, my fiancé and I started chatting with other customers - I just wanted to eat my burger. Speaking of the burger, it was alright. It's not the best, but reading the reviews here, I guess it was best for the neighborhood.

Service is casual but professional, and is together with the general atmosphere what makes you wish this was your neighbourhood , so you could come back every day.

We were 4 people and 2 people ordered the Moroccan Scramble and 2 people ordered the Ricotta Pancakes. We also started with the Truffle Fries that were fantastic! Probably the best breakfast I've had. The 2 dishes can definitely be shared. The Ricotta Pancakes were so amazing I almost finished the whole thing. There were 3 layers of fluffy, thick pancakes, blueberries, strawberries and bananas on top with a dollop of honeycomb butter. There were also bananas in between the first and second layer of the pancakes! Served with real maple syrup. The Moroccan Scramble was exceptional and my sister who doesn't eat eggs much, said it was the best dish she's ever had. Delicious hot chocolate, and latte. A MUST GO TO SPOT IF YOURE IN BROOKLYN!!! Get there early because there's always a wait!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The location and the service are pretty good. The problem I had was with the Octopus I ordered. I have quite low standards with food in general, but this octopus was just so so so bad. First time in my life, I had to send a full plate back to the kitchen. Maybe the other items in the menu are good, but I don't think I'll ever take the risk to try them :) I paid $15 bucks for a 3 pieces of plastic tasting, cold octopus.

It was one of the only places open at the time and was packed, but I found a seat at the counter. I thought it might be a run of the mill diner, but the menu was unique. I decided on the Moroccan scramble with sausage and avocado. There was a really cool mix of people from trendy indie types to workers to older French ladies. I also had a delicious glass of fresh orange juice. A lot of people were ordering the sage egg sandwich which also looked great!  It was a Thursday morning, but people were ordering Bloody Mary's and mimosas. I guess they don't have a regular job!

R C.,/user_details?userid=S4-gPMG0MCkCE8JljiAUgg,"Washington, DC",8/16/2015,1.0,No air conditioning!!! Cheap. The whole reason for eating out on a random Sunday in August is to not hear up ones own kitchen. I so wanted to go to this Resturant but apparently August (or summer for that matter) is not a good time. I suppose it is great. I'll have to wait until the late fall.

Tony M.,/user_details?userid=xv13lOr9MLiZpp_k3h9tjQ,"Brooklyn, NY",6/15/2015,2.0,ALWAYS A LONG WAIT ! Finally managed to eat here on a Monday afternoon and they had one empty table. They have a pretty limited menu for lunch/brunch and it's all food you can get everywhere else. Typical Brooklyn vibe/atmosphere and staff and a generally small establishment inside. The service was pretty bad/slow and our waitress was pretty soft spoken (and I have great hearing). The food wasn't bad but like I said very basic. Definitely wouldn't try eating here again considering the wait.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Also, it's just too noisy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We didn't make any reservations and got there in time for an 8pm dinner. The place looks great for breakfast/brunch too. Need to check it out during the daytime. Anyhow, I forgot to take pictures of my food here but there's plenty on their yelp page to see. We ordered the kale salad, truffle fries and shepherd's pie. Everything was so freaking delicious and fresh. The kale salad had a nice kick to it. You can taste the truffle in the fries - I'm still thinking of it and wishing I had some more for lunch! And the shepherd's pie was delicious. Blend of celery roots, with potatoes and carrot and meat...it was so savory and we both had two beers before hand so needless to say, we were stuffed after we were done. Love this spot.

One time I was able to get in with less than 10 minutes of wait-time, but then realized we were there over half an hour before they began serving their dinner menu, which explained why we were seated so easily.

We arrived on Wednesday noon and the place was still packed. We stayed outside as it was nice and sunny. My friend ordered brûléed grapefruit - a whole grapefruit served in a cup with some burned sugar on top and a mint leaf. She said she liked the flavor but it was really messy to eat. I was really excited about my pancakes. And it looked great, but ultimately I was disappointed. They were very dense and heavy with a huge blob of butter on top; eventually it made me feel like I was carrying stones in my stomach even 3 hours later. Also the portion is way too big, I barely finished 2 out of 3, i think it should be shared. So in the end I enjoyed it but because it made me feel so heavy, I don't think I would ever order it again.

Five Leaves cheese burger with truffle fries. This one is a must for burger lovers. (Grass fed beef, beets, pineapple, fried egg, lettuce, onions n tomato). It's huge and full of deliciousness and flavors with every bite. The only problem is figuring out a way to eat it because it's such a hand / mouth full.

After watching the people next to us get (who were seated after us) get served first, recieve and finish their food, we waited awhile longer. We watched others who ordered the same food recieve theirs before us as well. The people next to us started to ask why we hadn't gotten our food and when we finally asked the host he condescendingly told us it was because they had ordered scrambled eggs and we had a burger and that takes about 20 minutes. This was the reason we initially waited to say anything but after 30+ minutes of waiting that seemed excessive.

I don't like a stuffy place and I'm real fickle about my burger. But I enjoyed this. I don't get out this way much because I'm on the other side of Brooklyn.

Some would give it 4 because of the constant 1-1.5 hour wait but the wait is well worth it. Go take a walk on the east river, have a drink at a bar, or lay out at the park. The menu is pretty unique and not your typical brunch menu items. Everyone is my party was impressed. I'd say the standout dish was the morocan eggs which came layered on a piece of sliced baguette and topped with a handful of cilantro which gave it such a refreshing taste, but one of my favorite little details was the toasted spiced chickpeas. My boyfriend had the eggplant quinoa falafel which was great and it looked like they even made their own flatbread (this should be a go to for vegetarians.) My least favorite dish was actually the one I chose... the kale salad. It looked good when I had seen it at others tables but dressing which was described as an ""anchovy lemon dressing"" tasted more like a chipotle ranch dressing and took away from the fresh/clean feeling of a kale salad. It was good I like the toasted hazelnuts but the dressing was meh. Outside seating is always a plus.

Mike J.,/user_details?userid=WcmrSnB57uY4eL30RcZCzA,"Takoma Park, MD",2/1/2016,3.0,The food was good and our waitress was very polite. The reason why I only gave 3 stars is for the rude hostess who kept telling everyone that came in to go back outside. Now I understand that it is small and crowded inside but there is a proper way that you talk to customers and she definitely was not doing that.

I was surprised to see the sides were so massive, two would have been plenty for the two of us, but I'm glad we got to try almost all of them. They're were DELICIOUS, and the next best thing was the price. Only $6! You'd spend more than that at a deli or market for less food and of course, not any good. All sides were great.

heather s.,/user_details?userid=TE5FADymqWXdoySvHkEMYA,"Los Angeles, CA",5/6/2014,1.0,"This was one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant! We went for brunch on Sunday, party of 4. The space is extremely right. Granted, we expected a wait at any restaurant being Sunday afternoon. The host told us the wait was an hour, so we went to the place across the street since it was bigger and less crowded to get out of waiting in the cold. My friend kept going back to check in on the progress. She even told him 10 more minutes, ""I'm putting a table together for you all."" Which wasn't true/didn't happen. She went from 1 hour to 2 hours. She also failed to mention that brunch was over at 3pm. I only found out because I asked the bartender if we can take a look at the menu to decide what to order before sitting down since we had already waited just over 1 1/2 hrs. Their lunch menu is very limited so we decided to leave. We only went to try this place because of all the hype we heard from word of mouth. We just wish we would've been told when their brunch was over so we could've gone elsewhere. Definitely not worth the hype and we'll not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Judy S.,/user_details?userid=AbrA-Xg1JiRyZxgGayYB_A,"Port Washington, NY",2/27/2017,4.0,"Came here for brunch on Sunday and had a party of six.  We arrived at 10:30AM expecting an hour wait especially with such a large party and we were pleasantly surprised when we were told that our table was ready after only 30 minutes. While we waited outside I was surprised to see people eating outdoors in 45 degree weather with a stiff breeze.  Once inside we were seated and our waitress immediately took drink orders and gave us adequate time to look over our menus before taking our orders.  Our group had the Ricotta Pancakes, Mushroom Toast, Moroccan Scramble and Sage Scrambled Egg Panini. Everything was very good.  Portions were decent size except for the Sage Scrambled Egg Panini which was smallish.  The Ricotta Pancakes were as good as everyone said they would be.  The honeycomb butter was amazing.  The Mushroom Toast had a generous amount of sautéed maitake mushrooms and kale with a delicious brown wine sauce toppped with a beautifully poached egg. Delicious. Oh, and their coffee is also very good.  We enjoyed our meal and never felt rushed despite the people waiting outside.

Five Leaves' interior is cute but cramped so we always sit outside which is essentially sitting on the corner of a busy Williamsburgh/Greenpoint intersection but the food pretty much makes up for it. This whole New York couture burger thing that's been going on for a few years is getting out of hand and frankly I don't think Five Leaves' is so special. What is damn special are their delicious Thai inspired mussels (oh that broth!), the BLAT (bacon, lettuce, avocado and tomato sandwhich) as well as some hearty yet delicate salads and their delightful cocktail menu.

Yet another awesome restaurant here.  I tried their Alaska cocktail and really enjoyed its herbal ginniness, perfect for summer.  We demolished the fried oysters and devils on horseback. The irony of dates, a staple Middle Eastern food, wrapped in bacon, not lost on me every time I enjoy them. Opposites attract and compliment. Savory sweet.  Ying yang.  We also had the fried cauliflower which was good, although I'd fantasized about it differently.  I ordered the hanger steak, cooked perfectly to my request.  MP ordered the lamb shepherds pie (in July ?!) and loved it.  We said yes to dessert (!) and had pineapple upside down cake which MP loved.  I'm a bit more hedonistic and basic about my desserts and would have preferred it a little more rustic, less precious.  That said, I savored every bite and will return frequently now that we are in the neighborhood.  It's a fantastic restaurant with great atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The outside tables were all filled but there was plenty of room inside.  They played some cool background music (the Youngbloods, jazz, etc).   As our meal progressed, the place began to fill up, and by the time we left it was a packed party vibe.   So, if you like a quieter ambiance, come early!  The service was attentive throughout, though more personal before it got so crowded. While not inexpensive, our food was excellent.  We ordered a grilled fish called dorade, which was succulent and tasty.  Another dish consisting of sautéed ricotta cheese, was also delicious.  The truffle fries were fine, though not necessarily ""to die for"" as some other reviewers have contended.  The server recommended a Riesling wine, which was just right for us. We had to ask for bread, but once we did it was soft, yet crispy and tasty.  The chocolate pecan tart was a wonderful finish to our meal.  A minor complaint was that we ordered an ice tea and twice asked for refills.  We were unaware we'd be charged for three teas.  I would add a fifth star if you don't mind a crowded party scene as the evening progresses, or if you arrive around 5 pm for dinner while it's still calm and peaceful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered the moroccan scramble which looked beautiful but was really difficult to eat because it was in a huge unwieldy pile. There was hardly any merguez in it (i think i literally found 2 little crumbs) and the taste was meh. The avacado was in-edibly lemony, the bread was huge and hard to cut through and the raw pepper garnish on top was too fiery for most people i would think. This is a great example of a huge pet peeve of mine: adorable looking food that is impractical as hell to eat and doesn't even taste good. There did not seem to be much quality control happening.

My waitress was very friendly and excellent.

I had the granola and yogurt and fruit with coffee-yum!I have also been here for drinks and dinner at night as well, and everything excellent-the food and staff.

So far, I have enjoyed the cozy environs of this new little utopia on five occasions, none of which have disappointed me. I've sampled the roasted beet salad, truffle fries, pumpkin and butternut squash soups (served with crusty rustic rolls from the Sullivan Street Bakery), and the bacon wrapped dates. UH, YUM! My beloved recently indulged in the sage scrambled egg sandwich and declared that Five Leaves would be his new haunt. To boot, Five Leaves serves some of the most flavorful and pleasing coffee around. I could easily fritter away an afternoon sipping one of their cappuccinos and noshing on a roll or laze away a winter evening drinking a glass of their temperanillo and nibbling on some fries.  I will say that I have yet to indulge in a full scale dinner adventure at Five Leaves and I am slightly disappointed by the fact that though their beet root ravioli does look interesting, it is the ONLY vegetarian entree on the menu. Will it kill you to offer something other than pasta? And would it kill you to offer two options?

The bacon just fell apart and just sent this dish over the top.  This was by far the best scallop dish that I have ever had in my life and literally left me speechless.  I cant wait to come back for more!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Anita R.,/user_details?userid=WsMTv0lExrhWEphGTBX0cQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/21/2012,2.0,"I recently moved to Brooklyn from LA and my friends insisted that I try this place for brunch. After a lengthy wait we were seated outside, after some wait we got our drinks and food. It was average for the price, I would say. The menu is actually pretty limited and I had to settle on the Moroccan Scramble which while adventurous, didn't actually come out well as a breakfast dish- I found it overwhelming. I had some of my friend's truffle fries which were tasty but certainly not the best I've had. All in all I'd say this place relies heavily on the Heath Ledger hype and didn't wow me in the slightest.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

When I walked by, a scent of ricotta pancakes was in the air, compiled with banana, and a pile of berries. It looks as good as it sounds. I would say the coffee part is a little overpriced but the breakfast is a must. So I decided to try these ricotta pancakes. They came with a mound of honeycomb butter, toppled with berries, and a whole banana. These amazing pancakes filled me up quickly, and the texture was fluffy and soft. I highly recommend this place, just come before noon and you won't have to wait like a half-an hour for a table. I would also have to say that the exterior view is amazing. Also if you get the chance, definitely try the truffle fries. They are crispy and brown on the outside with softness bundled on the inside.

There needs to be greater consideration of pacing of courses especially for those with limited room at the bar. We felt rushed to eat all of our food while it's hot.

Ana S.,/user_details?userid=rA9YfWRHytpZK5_go1v8og,"NY, NY",3/22/2023,4.0,"You gotta love this place for what it is, a swanky bar for drinks and socializing. The food is lacking, especially the dishes that aren't Korean, but the drinks are superb and the bartenders are beyond attentive. They take care of you like a baby, with a napkin when you need it, a warning that the dish is hot or a change of plates. They always have their eye on you to make your experience as cozy as possible. If you must eat though, the oysters are fresh and tasty, and the Korean classic chicken wings are the perfect combination of crispy, sweet and spicy. The uni bibimbap sounds exciting but the uni was very bitter and the dish overly oily and lacking in flavor. The gambas dish even more so, if you can imagine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/osamil-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Eunice Y.,/user_details?userid=whjGpaAMSZX8fFh_3ZbUng,"New York, NY",2/3/2023,4.0,"We ordered French fries ($8), wings ($16), endive and Korean pear salad ($17), oden tang ($28), osamil kimchi fried rice w/ hanger steak ($35), uni bibimbap ($38), and pork shank ($43). The flavor profile for the most of food we ordered was honestly not impressive to me except their pork shank, but their price is just insane.. you can tell the price is high when you look at kimchi fried rice for $25 and oden tang for $28. Their happy hour is 5-7 for drinks, but their last call for the drinks was 6:40pm which I think was too early for the last call. Service was very attentive and quick. Food came out quick as well. Overall, the presentation for the food was nice/instagrammable, but I couldn't give them 5 stars because of the price. Will I come back?

Most of the food & beverage items sounded better than they tasted. Cocktails were too light, and too sweet but I love the concept and variety they offer. I didn't see this coming but I really enjoyed their chicken dishes. The wings had great crisp and juicy flavors , and and the Korean Market Fried Chicken. The quality and flavor is all there. The beef tartare had a wonderful spicy umami flavor, but what a minuscule portion. Not going to order the pork shank and uni bibimbap again.
