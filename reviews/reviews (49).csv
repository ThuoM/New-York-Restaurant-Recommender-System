When we arrived, I was a little hesitant about eating here because it was so clean (lol). I know that sounds strange but like all the amazing dim sum places I ever been to were chaotic and messy! Anyways, immediately we are greeted with the man who wears a UCLA uncle hat. He knew Filipino dishes so the first thing he offered my entire family was lugaw  (congee). The family couldn't say no - so they got some and they liked it. For our meal, we ordered the chicken juicy dumpling, pork dumpling, shrimp shumai, chicken feet, Peking duck, pineapple fried rice, and this beef noodle dish that I didn't catch the name of. Everyone enjoyed the meal taste-wise! I had ordered the pineapple fried rice, hoping it was going to come in a pineapple like the photo, but it didn't. That was the only upsetting part. Other than that, we're definitely coming back to visit! When I come by myself, I will definitely be ordering more than we did during our visit. I felt like I needed to experience more but we had all gotten full very fast! I didn't get many photos and took more videos... whoops!

I was excited to come here due to the rave reviews, but I found the dim sum dishes average. Ordering consists of checking off what you want on the menu. The chicken feet were cut into smaller pieces than other restaurants and seemed thinner. This dish comes with peanuts, so be aware if you are allergic. I thought the turnip cakes could have been seared more so that it has a crispier edge. There was too much oyster sauce on them.

Grace Y.,/user_details?userid=WXOPvu53iSgej-w_0tnbSg,"New York, NY",6/21/2020,5.0,"I wanted to get stir fried e-fu noodles (yi mein) and the only place on UberEats that looked like they had it was Dim Sum Palace. I couldn't tell which item on the menu was what I was looking for, so I called them and asked them in Cantonese. They told me to order the braised e-fu noodles, and they would replace it for me with what I wanted. I also got the sichuan wontons, pork and thousand year egg congee, and coconut pudding. There actually isn't much dim sum on their UberEats menu. The congee and e fu noodles were excellent and standardly portioned. The sichuan wontons were a bit disappointing - the filling was too firm and the sauce too cornstarchy and gelatinous. The coconut pudding was more watery than expected and a bit too sweet but still good.

Tanya H.,/user_details?userid=EyxIGr0nzrPs-EwDYepymg,"New York, NY",5/29/2021,5.0,"The dim sum is made fresh here, and that makes the high prices worth it. It's not overpowering or heavy, unlike other dimsum places where it feels like you're eating buckets of salt/msg. I like that they make chicken shumai here, it's not a strong but comfortable and homey flavor. The congee has many big chunks of meat and pidan. The chashu bun is super fluffy, with yummy sweet meat filling. I would say that the soup dumplings have a thicker, chewier and less artfully folded skin than what you might get at a true soup dumpling restaurant, perhaps since this isn't a Shanghainese establishment but rather Canto. That said, the soup inside is savory and light, and you can tell the skin was housemade, it's still good. The auntie and waitstaff treated us well, and our food was brought out at a good pace.

This place was perfect. We sat outside, which is enclosed. It was packed inside at 1220p on a Sunday. You order via a menu with photos instead of carts. The food was fresh and really good. I would say better than Chinatown's Golden Unicorn, Jing Fong, and Pings. Dumplings are $2-4 more, but worth it.

Susanna M.,/user_details?userid=6bM_FqFaOzdwJQy8g_NuCA,"New York, NY",7/28/2021,5.0,"So, I'm finally reviewing Dim Sum Palace after going here since 2018. I grew up eating dim sum with my mom and going on trips home to Taiwan. This is my favorite location of the local chain and the best place you can go in the East Village for dim sum. Tim Ho Wan can not compare (like really, why would you go there if you can go HERE?). When I lived in the east village I would go here minimum twice a month for dim sum and now that I've moved out of the neighborhood I still go out of my way to go here once a month. I would recommend it to anyone. It's affordable and you can't go wrong with their dim sum dishes. I typically go with one other person and get their har gow, shu mai, spare ribs, xiao long bao (soup dumplings), and typically supplement with one to two other dishes. On the weekends they have rice rolls so I definitely recommend getting those if you have the chance. They currently have an indoor and outdoor area to eat. The service is great and the food is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-9?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The downside is the sauce, which is gloppy and a bit gelatinous. They would do better with a really good simple hot oil. The cold sesame noodles are very basic. The scallion pancake has a better than average taste and consistency. We did really enjoy the shrimp shumai; which had a very nice amount of shrimp.

The logo outside doesn't help too much, looks a bit basic and tacky but when you enter the restaurant it feel different. Nothing too luxurious or special but it's clean, interior design is nice and simple. A pretty comfortable environment. Not super big or small, just a good size and several tables and it's usually not packed at all. Speaks both mandarin and English. Good service..friendly staffs, attentive, doesn't rush you, doesn't assume you speak Chinese because you look like one, and honestly pretty great prices. Quite a few different options for dim sum but they do have other Chinese dishes from appetizers, meat/veggies, to noodles or rice. A couple desserts and beverages too. Tasty food and nice texture. The Braised Five Spice Duck looks simple but tastes really nice and it's not too dry either. My friend wasn't a big fan on the bamboo shoot dumplings but I find it okay, doesn't have the ""wow"" factor but it's simple and light so good for the stomach. The steamed spare ribs w/ olive sauce was one of my favourite. Shrimp dumpling is like most places so nothing too special but they tastes good. Chicken feet was nice too. Shu Mai (shrimp and pork) was definitely my friend's favourite,:$3 almost wanted a second one. Is portion is perfect for the both of us.

I just like to eat good food so ok, I am I guess. I've been to my share of dim sum places and this has to be one of the better dim sum spots. I've had some of the best dim sum in Tai Pei, San Fran, and in Vancouver, and this place come in very very close. First off, each dish was fresh and meticulously made. When a chef takes pride in his/her creation, it definitely shows and tastes amazing. My wife, who is a finicky eater, even liked it here. As with many NY restaurants, this place is fairly small but the decor and the ambiance was nice. Table cloth was a nice touch and the it was clean overall. I usually don't care about the ambiance of a restaurant unless it's a special occasion but it's worth mentioning.

Sandy W.,/user_details?userid=6kHuqVMxrF3zo8odrTjijw,"Providence, RI",9/22/2019,2.0,"This is definitely the worst dim sum place among all my experiences in New York for the couple years. To be honest, the environment is clean and service is good, however this couldn't help to raise the overall rating because their dim sum is below average. We ordered a couple dumplings to start, and the skins are too think while the fillings are all flavorless. We then tried the radish cake, and there is way more corn stretch than radish, making it soggy and flavorless. We also ordered the rice roll and the beef tasted dry as if you just heat up some frozen meat. No flavor again aside from the soy sauce. Their congee is also too over cooked that you can't really taste the texture of the rice. If you want congee, Congee Village or any other classic dim sum place in Chinatown would offer much better options. The congee is faThe best would be the taro bun and sesame balls filled with taro.

Samantha E.,/user_details?userid=EVChLoqN0MyNBtYjFMkO5g,"New York, NY",12/23/2018,3.0,"I've been anxiously anticipating the grand opening of this new Dim Sum Palace location since the sign for it went up this summer. Finally went today with a group of friends for Sunday dim sum. There was no wait - it doesn't seem to have been really discovered by the neighborhood yet. There is not much dim sum competition in the neighborhood - Tim Ho Won is nearby but very overpriced. I thought that this place was good, overall, but lacking diversity of the menu and with a bit of room to improve on the dim sum. There is a 20% discount for dim sum right now during the opening, and a free dim sum with yelp check in, so I advise you to go try it before these deals run out. We tried several dishes. garlic spareribs were a highlight - dried garlic and chili on top made them very tasty. Also tried pork and shrimp siao mai - both very meaty and tasty. The Ha gow was good as well. The tiny pork buns could be improved - they don't have very much meat inside, mostly vegetables. And the soup dumplings were a bit low on the soup - mostly just pork inside. The green sesame peanut dessert balls were very good but the sesame balls were a bit undercooked - the dough was very soft and not as chewy as usual.

The siu mai were delicious with nice thin wrappers filled with big plump pieces of shrimp. I was pleasantly surprised as usually siu mai are mainly filled with pork rather than shrimp. My favorite dish was definitely the egg custard buns. The buns themselves were fluffy and soft and filled with a gooey perfectly sweet egg custard. So good and definitely a must order. I might come back just to order these some time.

The sushi rolls are fine, but the rice isn't fresh (though I guess you can't expect too much from a casual place like this). The udon was also fine, but tasted almost like it came out of some sort of instant udon packaging.

The Ninja stick has spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, teriyaki sauce, egg, avocado and some kind of mayo. I was not expecting it to be as amazing and big as it was. While it is $12, the roll is the size of a hero sandwich like a big sushi burrito.

The proprietor was very friendly and you could tell when someone had come back more than once. He even remembered some preferred orders. He is a hard working man, and puts passion in his food creations. The most popular food were the ""Yummy Sticks"" which are essentially thin sushi burritos that you unroll from foil and bite.

The brussels sprouts were flavorful and did the trick to get a veggie fix.  Pass on the bing.  It is nothing more than naan and some kind of sweet chili jam. The meati nuggets were a tad spicy and perhaps should have been made with the sweet chili jam from the bing.  My favorite was the crispy potatoes with the notes of sour cream and crunchiness.  It was comforting and tasty.  Overall, the bites were a smorgsbord of ideas and flavors, some tasty where you want to eat the whole thing yourself and not share with your companions (e.g. potatoes), some where 1 piece was perfection (pork belly bun), some where you can't eat but 1 piece (meati nuggets) and some where the description and expectation were too different (bing) and the deconstruction dessert which was a disaster in presentation but you still ate it.  Go here for the view with a group.

Nigora R.,/user_details?userid=Jlq01yETUVzfeHiO-C1Rwg,"Manhattan, NY",1/21/2023,4.0,They sat my boyfriend and I right away. No reservation was needed that Saturday afternoon. We ate off of the restaurant menu which is a great value because it includes a drink and two courses for $45 a person. I had the best iceberg salad of my life. Typically iceberg salads have no flavor but this one did. I really like the sesame on it. The Palmer was a lemonade and I love how green it was. Really yummy. The waffle was average. It could have use more apple and more flavor. My boyfriend had the chicken burger which was a really nice portion. Feel free to ask for a knife and fork for that burger!Service was attentive but not overbearing.

Nicole B.,/user_details?userid=QxJ2YrfZtHjXurI9m3h9qA,"San Diego, CA",10/28/2022,2.0,"I was really looking forward to eating at Momofuku Ssam Bar but unfortunately had a very disappointing experience. I've eaten at his restaurant in Las Vegas and have always had an incredible experience. With that being said, the food was ok but the service was awful. We made a 9:30 year reservation and received a call around 8:30 saying that we could come by earlier. We weren't able to so showed up a few minutes before our 9:30 reservation. We were rudely greeted by the hostess who seemed to be extremely upset that we had shown up so late (at 9:28 for our 9:30 reservation). I understand people want to call it a night early sometimes but don't offer reservations at this time if you're not capable of delivering on the David Chang experience. So once they begrudgingly sat us, the waitress comes up and says kitchen is about to close so you have one shot to put in all your food. There's definitely a more customer-service appropriate way to say that...anyways we ordered the ssam set which was overall very good. Drinks were also solid. The meats were all good and I really enjoyed the salad. The raw fish dish, hamachi I think, was a little fishy but the bing and salad made up for it. The meats were all tasty and the star of the meal. We ordered the oysters which were pretty standard but the $55 cacio e pepe rice cakes were not worth the price tag. You could tell throughout the meal that they were trying to rush us so they could get out of there, which really deterred from the experience. Once again, I know everyone is tired and overworked but we're pretty low maintenance so I just ask for a decent experience when we're paying to go to a nice restaurant. The subpar service really put me off to coming back to this restaurant. Would not recommend it unless there's a turnaround and more focus on service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jane L.,/user_details?userid=_W1HZ_lW34YUjCIFIVrHFQ,"Queens, NY",10/24/2022,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this new iteration of Momofuku Ssam Bar. I was a big fan of the old location and appreciated how intimate it was and how it reflected the David Chang swagger of the other earlier Momofuku restaurants. That vibe is nowhere to be found in the new location. It feels like an overpriced tourist trap geared toward people who have a lot of money to spend, want to dabble in some gateway Korean food (and/or perhaps are not comfortable with venturing to K-town), and want to see and be seen. It looks like it was designed for social media posts. That being said, the food was decent. Our group participated in the full Ssam tasting menu and liked all of the dishes. Nothing was exceptionally memorable for me other than the salad (randomly). All of the dishes were very ""safe"" and not terribly exciting, but they were well executed. The service was good until the end, when we were asked to leave because they had to ""free up the table,"" even though all of the large tables around us were unoccupied. One other observation that I found to be somewhat interesting (as an Asian) was that I didn't see any Asians among the many staff members who were working there the night we went. I find that unusual for  an Asian restaurant, but perhaps this just happened to be case the night we went. Ultimately, I doubt I will return to Ssam because it just feels like a ""new Coke"" version of the old location, but I do think the overall experience would be enjoyable for most people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Clara C.,/user_details?userid=ux_IwqtckDUKinXCrUkrmQ,"Santa Clara, CA",10/24/2022,4.0,"This was another spot in Chinatown that I kept seeing all over my social media. When we got here there was also a line and my friend and I probably waited like 30 mins. Keep in mind this place is also cash only but it's super cheap, we ordered a small roast pork and roast duck and it was only $6. Overall thoughts on this place is their meat is good but their rice is a bit more soggy, I think they they cook the rice they added a bit too much water and when they pour the sauce form the meat over is makes it more soggy. One of my other friends went on a different day and also said the rice was also soggy so I think maybe that's just how they make it. They also have a larger option for a little but more but my friend and I just wanted to share the small one. I think it's good to try this spot, for the meat and not the rice!

We had roughly 5 people in front of us that took a while since they were ordering so much. I ended up getting a small plate - half char siu and half roasted duck since we still had so many places to explore after. My first bite was fairly solid - a good piece of char siu with rice covered in a savory sauce. The duck was fatty and well seasoned. Was I completely blown away? Not really - but it's still really good Chinese bbq. The price point is great and the amount of food you get is totally worth it! For that - it still deserves a 5 stars and I am super jealous of all the people who live in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sometimes I work from home just because I'm craving Wah Fung for lunch. Once I went to the gym but one of the staff brought in duck for lunch which I can't say for sure was from Wah Fung, but reminded me of the restaurant so when I left the gym I immediately walked to pick up my lunch from Wah Fung. My favorite is the crispy pork belly over rice and a small is enough to knock me out for a midday nap. The other options are char siu, duck, and chicken. I've tried them all but there's something about the fatty pork belly with the crisp skin and slightly burnt edges that goes so well with the sweetness of the cabbage and rice.

So I decided to take pork($6.50) and chicken($6.50) large plates. They really not playing games with portions. They've huge. Chicken was slightly dry and a tons of bones were inside.

Candi K.,/user_details?userid=7BmJFB0R-7RIydtIJ8sJZg,"New York, NY",2/14/2021,5.0,"In honor of Chinese (Lunar) New Year we drove downtown to Chrystie St (near Hester) to fulfill my craving for char siu pork.  I asked my NYC Hong Konger friend ""Where's the best place to buy char siu pork?""  He told me Green Garden but I saw a big C on the door and balked.  I'm never trusting that friend again with New York Chinese food advice.  TC, I'm talking about you!  All I wanted to find was a simple, cheap, reasonably clean Chinese meat counter shop like Nam Fong in Honolulu Chinatown to buy juicy cuts of char siu, roast pork, duck or chicken.  Wah Fung No.1 in NYC Chinatown is that place!  We arrived late around 10:55am and there was a line to the street corner.  The shop is so small that only 1 or 2 customers are allowed in at a time.  At first it didn't move so fast (too many indecisive customers?) and we had to listen to firecracker music from the next door gift shop.  But we finally got in the door at 11:25am.  We bought a large takeout container of char siu pork (no rice, no cabbage, only meat!) and I had to hide my joy when they said $12!  They had to repeat it twice, I couldn't believe my luck!  CASH ONLY though so luckily I had $ in my purse.  There's one butcher inside chopping up your meat and another person at the cash register.  It looks just like Nam Fong in Honolulu.  I felt like I was home in Hawaii's Chinatown (the 2nd oldest Chinatown in the U.S.).  We were in and out in 3 minutes with our cherished char siu in our tote bag.  Wah Fung also sells ""plates"" of char siu, roast pork or chicken and rice for $4.50, but we just wanted fresh char siu to season our home-cooked fried rice, Singapore noodles or soup.  Beware however the char siu sauce is very sticky and leaked inside our tote bag (my husband was carelessly bouncing the bag on his shoulder).  It smelled so good that we couldn't wait to snack on it - rushed back to our car and ate the char siu on top of cilantro and scallion steamed rice rolls that we bought for $2 each from Delicious Huang Bakery around the corner on Hester Street. Wah Fung gives huge portions.  Good value for char siu exactly like what I grew up eating.  I only remembered to take a photo halfway through our feast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Hole in the wall, no frills, and everyone who comes knows what they are getting. They're pretty quick and calm and collected, and it's definitely a neighborhood gem. The little box I got was hefty but probably more due to the amount of rice.

Because of COVID they allowing two customer inside. Or always have been 2 people inside, because simply not enough space for 4 people. No Dining in space.  I already knew what I was gonna order roasted pork and duck combo for only $7.50!!!!! But many uncultured tourists need a lot of time to figure out what they want.  It literally says on the signage #1 fast food, but more of a must stop tourist hot spot with average wait time of 20minutes or longer.  When it was finally my turn to place the order there was one skinny old man and a young apprentice working together.  I ordered and got my food and set on the nearby park bench. White rice at the bottom and stirred fried napa cabbage on top of the rice and roasted pork and duck at the very top.  Nice crust textures on the pork and it tasted delicious!! Who needs fried chicken from Zaxby's;).

I did not expect to wait about a half an hour in line, but it sure was worth it. We got to try the duck on rice and the pork on rice. We are happy with both. The duck and the pork or such different flavor profiles and I am so glad that I ordered them both because though they are different, they sure to complement each other. The duck has a nice Crunchy texture that goes so well with a nice warm bed of rice. It's also very fatty and it taste so good. If you have never had duck I would highly suggest that you do try. This would be a great place for you to try duck as a first timer. Now the pork was very different. The pork was also on rice, but it also tasted different because of the sweeter profile. It almost had a candy like texture. And I was very happy having it. Unfortunately we weren't able to sit in the restaurant, so we took it over to the park and got to enjoy the weather and we even got to enjoy some locals doing some Dance or exercise.

You're probably asking yourself, what's the difference with the roasted pork and the pig? Well let me tell you. The roasted pork is a marinated chopped up meat which has that slight sweet taste and the pig is similar to a lechón and not marinated. I know going into this, it was my first meal of the day, and without that bias of starving, the food was great! The meat was juicy and tender and fresh. The rice was moist and slightly sticky. The perfect meal for a college student who has 5 bucks to spare and be  full of quality Chinese bbq. A must go in NYC! Bring cash! It's the only way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I got the duck and well just a heads up it's 5% duck 95% bones. The flavors were fine (not amazing), rice was okay, and the vegetable tasted old. I don't frequently eat vegetables but it's pretty easy to tell what's almost spoiled and what isn't. Whatever duck there was wasn't tender and cooked well enough either as it took a considerable amount of time to chew.

Leo Y.,/user_details?userid=FaqTnv6hKl35006S8OZK9Q,"Brooklyn, NY",11/13/2020,5.0,"This is a classic Cantonese roastery across the block from the end of grand St park. Back in the day you could find stacked boxes of meat and rice for only $5.00, but due to covid and inflation prices have gone up to around $6.50. It's still an excellent deal, nonetheless. The master roaster and butcher chops up a mountain of meat for each order. They serve char siu, roast pig, roast duck, soy sauce chicken, and more. My personal favorites are the char siu half fatty, half lean, and the roast pig. There's a wonderful crunch from the roast pig and a delectable sweetness to contrast the savory dish. You absolutely can't go wrong with any fish though. Everything is made in house, and for Manhattan it's an absolute steal.

Waiting on line made everyone eager with anticipation and the food did not disappoint. I ordered the small roast pork combo over rice, took it over to the park across the street and devoured the whole container of food. The only knock on the experience was that the food wasn't as much as I've seen in previous pictures or reviews. The amount of food for the price was fine but I guess my YouTube-hyped expectations thought there would be more pork but all in all the overall amount of food was perfectly adequate.

It was cheap for a small carton of rice, cabbage and meat (4.25 for pork or chicken and Duck has an additional charge). My siblings and I got pork and duck. When we came there was a line. You have to watch out Bc the shipowner next door will come out and sort of shoo you if the line blocks her shop. The inside was nice. You can see the workers cutting up the meat right in front of you. Taste was alright. The duck was eh. There wasn't much flavor and the rice was bland. The pork was much better tasting. It was sweeter and saltier and coupled with the rice better. Recommend pork over duck if you had to choose. Would recommend coming here. Definitely worth it for the price and a visit if you're visiting from somewhere else and want to explore different eats in china town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

That's what our daughter believed and we were there on her recommendation. As we waited the smells became more and more enticing and we viewed the roasted meats hanging in the window with mouth-watering anticipation. Finally it was our turn! The chef chopped the pork, laid it on white rice in an aluminum pan and spooned some drippings and broth over it. We eagerly paid and headed back out to the sidewalk to see if it would live up to our daughter's review. One bite of this incredibly flavorful, moist, tender pork with crispy edges, combined with the fantastic sauce and perfectly cooked rice was all it took for us to join Team Wah Fung! We agree it is the best pork in NYC! Maybe the world.

I would've liked to have a little more meat and less rice, but I can't complain for $6. The line was out the door, but the store is very small, and they move pretty fast.

They have the $6 for Meats where you can choose any meats you want either for porks for chickens or two porks or two chicken.. it's a dollar more if you want the noodles instead of the rice.

Jenna L.,/user_details?userid=c8Du5NCHQwEu-kGio1-4yA,"Albany, NY",10/6/2016,5.0,Wow. So good. My husband and I both got the roast pork with ginger sauce and my mother in law got the roast chicken. It was excellent. I'm not huge on ginger but so glad I got the dollop of ginger sauce on the pork because it was really excellent and added a nice contrasting flavor. The place says it closes at 6pm but they kept serving past them. There was a long line the entire time we were there but the two guys worked hard to move it as fast as they could. They do not have soy sauce packets so be sure to have some at home if you like that on your rice. The meat is really well seasoned and doesn't need it at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was turned onto the Roast Pig (which is different than the Roast Pork/Char Siu) by a friend and it is by far my favorite option there. It's all white meat... crispy, fatty, and full of flavor. It reminds me of really great southern barbecue thrown into a Chinese barbecue joint. All the right levels of crispy, salty, juicy, etc. My second favorite is probably the duck which is also super tasty along with the rice and cabbage they throw in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Obviously, that created a very high expectation about their food. When I arrived on a Saturday afternoon, there was a short line of people waiting, but the line moved pretty quickly. I ordered a large size combo of char siu and roasted pork. After my first bite of the roasted pork, I found it very bland, but the skin was good though very crispy. After eating almost the entire meal, there was only one particular piece of roasted pork that was well seasoned, but the rest was very bland. Not sure if the chef did a lousy job seasoning the pig that day. The char siu was ok, I found it to be a little bit too sweet and was lacking the real char siu flavor. The only good thing is that this place gives bigger portion than other Chinese restaurants for the 2 combo. Overall, I was disappointed about the food. It was too much hype. There are definitely much better places out there in term of flavor and quality in Chinatown and Brooklyn Chinese areas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This shop have been around for years. Students and old timers love to come here for the $3.75 special of BBQ roast pork/chicken with rice and veggies. This is all day special. I just order the small box for lunch. The guy that works here is fast and efficient. He chops the BBQ roast pork and chicken so fast. I know his arm is strong but all the years of cutting may hurt his arm. The lines are long everyday. Yesterday when I went the line moved quickly. The owner hired another guy to help him with the orders. In the past it was the owner and wife. This place is still popular and affordable for everyone in chinatown. Good place to get comfort food.

Spending my childhood exploring Chinatown in SF, NYC's Chinatown definitely blew it out of the park with this little hole-in-the-wall eatery that was delicious and cheap.

The young man behind the counter is the same from years go and he's a real sweetheart. There's such a long line for lunchtime that the neighboring store's owner/manager was yelling at the poor owner of this eatery to move his customers waiting in line and blocking her store.

Vennessa S.,/user_details?userid=tTK8aOKhvBNGxbJFDFKLWg,"Chandler, AZ",2/19/2020,5.0,"Literally, THE best Chinese BBQ we have EVER had. We were visiting NY from AZ and came across a ton of recommendations for this place. We walked long and far to find it, stood in line for over 10 mins - out the door in 20° weather (cold for us Arizonans) and it did not disappoint! We got the BBQ pork and Roast duck combo, came with rice and steamed veggies for under $7. Definitely the cheapest meal of our entire trip and probably the best tasting meal as well. Me and my boyfriend shared this because we wanted to explore as many restaurants, dessert and drink shops as possible. There are no tables inside nor outside.

Jocelyn K.,/user_details?userid=AjrQR51BIpJ2ELxq4MjtWA,"Ridgefield, NJ",2/16/2020,4.0,"Decided to check this place out with some friends after seeing it on the Insider. There was a line when we arrived, but we waited around 15 minutes max. We got our food pretty much right after ordering. My friends and I got a large roast duck and pork belly ($6.50) Both came with cabbage, white rice and a few spoonfuls of their respective juices (yum). The pork belly was my favorite out of the two.The skin was super crispy! It was slightly too salty but the white rice and cabbage helped offset it. My friend said he was going to go back and get just the pork belly ($9). The roast duck was okay, each bite I had mainly consisted of bones with little meat so I was disappointed about that since my friends had raved about it before. I'll definitely come back to try the char siu and give the roasted duck another chance. All in all, worth the price and wait!

This place provides a generous serving of delicious pork for less than $5. I come here regularly when I'm in the area and will sometimes make a trip out from Queens for it if I'm really craving it. There's plenty of Chinese BBQ places near me but I'm more than happy to make the trip out. I've yet to come early enough to get noodles instead of rice but I believe that speaks volumes about the store.

Ling J.,/user_details?userid=KcQF4Pkfs_ZgdPBk61baAw,"New York, NY",6/5/2019,5.0,"I'm so hooked on the BBQ meats from this fast food restaurant. Oh well, it is more of a take-out. Even though it is advertised as a fast food restaurant, it is not what you think - the meats are roasted carefully and they are in the ready to serve status if you will. The store front is very small and you'd walk pass through it without even noticing. But hey you can't, you know why, because there is always a line. After this place was featured by several vloggers, it is getting even more popular, with tourists all over the world even. The other weekend when I was in line waiting for my perfect chicken, duck and pork combo, I overheard a group of tourists asking a lady behind me about the food. Unfortunately they asked the wrong person, or maybe the lady behind me did not want to deal with these tourists, she replied nothing special, just for a quick bite. No, she was 100% incorrect and ironically she stood in line for her meal after turning away the group of tourists. I feel so bad for the misinformed tourists. They completely missed a perfect opportunity to experience Chinatown and a tasty meal which are not available in typical Chinese take-outs in the states. Alright, let me speak about the meats. I'm sure by now you've probably heard that is one of the best place to get charsiu AKA Chinese roasted pork in NYC. But what most people don't know yet is their chicken is equally as amazing or even better. I found charsiu can be a little over sweet but the chicken is cooked perfectly. The juicy and tender dark meats are infused with cooking wine and soy sauce. And the crunchy skin gives extra chews and adds up more flavor. The stewed cabbages are quite delicious too.  It is so simple but adds so much freshness and balance to the meal. I'd be very satisfied with a small combo meal and if you are really hungry, a large combo will definitely fill up your stomach with only 7 bucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I've tried other places, but Wah Fung remains the best. The meat is always perfectly cooked, just the right mix of tenderness and firmness, with a great glaze--not too sweet or salty. It's also really nice that you get a bit of cabbage along with your meal, as most places just plop the pork on top of rice and send you on your way. At least here you can pretend you're eating slightly healthier since there's some vegetables on the side (though they really do help cut the richness of the pork as you eat). The chicken and duck are both pretty good, but my favorite order is half roast pork, half char siu pork. The roast pork has an amazingly crunchy skin, and combination of flavor and texture is impressive. While the occasional long line can be deterring, the price and quality of the pork offerings is unbeatable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The cabbage, cooked in the broths of the soup, is perfectly soft and flavorful. The grilled pork is perfectly cooked with a crunchy texture on the .outside and chewy texture inside. The BBQ pork isn't even remotely dry, as it is juicy with just the right amount of fat and lean meat. Put all of that over a bed of rice, and you have the perfect lunch box. You can get their special smaller size portion for around $4, or get the larger portion for $6. Since it comes with veges, it's a great alternative to the usual junk food at these prices.

I saw a video on youtube by Mike Xing Chen aka strictly dumpling. In his video review of dishes from Wah Fung he proclaims their char siu to be the best outside of Hong Kong and boy was he right! I have had char siu in Brooklyn and it does not compare at all to the char siu at Wah Fung. My order today was 2 char siu over vegetable, 2 char siu over noodles, 1 roasted soy sauce chicken over vegetable and 1 roasted pig over vegetable. I skipped the rice because I have no desire for it. All white rice does is take up belly space for no reason. I just want the good stuff. The roasted soy sauce chicken is so flavorful and the skin is that awesome gelatinous skin which sticks your lips and melts in your mouth. The roasted pig is awesome! The crispy skin puts it over the top and makes it super enjoyable. I must say that the char siu at Wah Fung is elite and is the way to go no matter how many times you visit. There are few things worth  going on long walks for, but the char siu at Wah Fung is well worth every step. I am now hooked on this stuff and am proud to admit it.

Chloe S.,/user_details?userid=XH4_ND1zwe6PIdMuF89MSA,"Seattle, WA",10/16/2015,5.0,I thought I just had to come to Wah Fung before I took the Fung Wah bus back to Boston. You know this place is gonna be good by the fact that the line is around the block. Trust me it's worth it. For $5 you get a GIANT styrofoam container full of rice and cabbage and then the entire surface is covered in amazing delicious BBQ meat. If you want a normal sized portion you can get a smaller container with mostly less rice for $3.75. Cash only here (obviously). They have a very limited menu in the best possible way. I got the pork and my friend got the chicken and both were incredible. Some of the best of this style of food I've had.

I no longer get the chicken or pork after trying the pig. It makes me feel gross as it's really oily, tasty as well as the exterior is crunchy fat that's heart-stopping great. In case you adore fat-encrusted greasy meat, get the pig. It's really nice and so poor at the exact same time.

For $3.75 you can get a small char siu fan (roast pork rice) and they also have soy sauce chicken and duck.

The next day (Sunday/today) I decided it was worth it from viewing all of the mouth watering photos. I live in Hells Kitchen and decided to trek all the way out here which took 30 minutes due to the D train rerouting onto the F line (boo). Waited in line for a good 20-25 minutes. Messenged my roommates if they wanted to try anything from this place (all 3 decided ""yes"") and put in their orders and venmo'ed me. I held up the line a bit with my order: 1 roast pork + rice, 1 roast pork + noodle, 1 roast duck + noodle, 1 whole roast duck chopped up & 1 roast pig + rice. Total? $34!!! I only had 20bills so I gave them the change. I'm assuming no one tips at this place because the old lady and man holding down the joint looked at me at first with confusion and then gratitude. The $6 tip they deserve for the speedy service & later, justified in the tasty meal. OMG. Do you like no frills, greasy Chinese food?! This place is it. I got back to my Hells Kitchen apartment an hour later because there was subway delays (con ed decided to power off in some stations)... anyway I decided to have a feast by myself in front of the tv + an already opened bottle of prosecco. The taste of the food was exactly what I had been craving!!! Each to-go box was filled to the brim and overpacked with rice and meat ! Let's just say I will be back.

While I'm all about mom and pop shops in today's age of gentrified neighborhoods and I am a Chinese native in this area for over 30 years, this business should not be operating and if you had access to the stairwell just next door of them to see their basement and yard, you would see the truth. If I still had access, I would have provided photos but anyone with access to the building would see this. They even kept a poor diseased cat who had infected eyes and a bad limp in this area of the basement, running really hot down there. One day they saw me trying to rescue it but it got away in another locked room down there, and the next day the cat was gone and never seen again for the next few months, when it used to be there every day with no escape to the outdoors.

His old offerings (usual food cart fare) was in the back. And the rice boxes were in the front. It was so cheap a few years ago and it was still delicious.

Get a large pork, chicken, or duck over rice for the best bang for your buck as it actually costs more for the same amount of meat if you order the meat alone. The small meat over rice is also a good deal but why not look under your couch for an extra buck twenty five to get double the food?

Wah Fast Food is a tiny store front with no seating but they do not mess around on the food. Their Cha Shao pork is to die for and the duck and the chicken are amazing too. The line is always the most torturous part as you can smell the sweet and savory aromas of the pork the entire time you are waiting. You order your food and they chop up the pork/duck/chicken fresh for you. I always make sure to order just some pork to take home and freeze for later. The menu is mostly in Chinese so bring your best Chinese friend if you want the most authentic experience.

We each got a small pork over vegetables (it's just cabbage) and rice. For two of those and a bottle of water only set us back $8. We took it to go and waited to eat it on the bus. At this point, it was cold but still very tasty. It was very filling so even with the small, I could only eat half to start. It was a little greasy, but food tends to show it's true amount of oil when it cools down. I'd definitely recommend it for it's value and quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This place is a hit or miss really, and it may be hard to communicate if you don't really understand or speak Chinese (this coming from a Chinese girl herself who knows only a few phrases in Cantonese). Luckily there's a menu right behind the Chef. I ordered the large with all 3 types of meat, and I was rather disappointed, forewarned by previous yelp reviews that the duck had a lot of bones I still thought I should sample all 3 meats, and my favorite was definitely the pork (char siew) just because of the flavoring it had and the fact that it had no bones!!! Seriously I cannot emphasize this enough the bones in the duck varied from noticeable to these little pebbles that I did not even realize were bones until I bit down on it, and damn did my tooth hurt after. Overall this place is a small business but for its pricing which was 3.75 for a small (which I should have gotten) and $6 for a large with any meat, this lunch was definitely a steal. I'm definitely returning again for that char siew. But be warned cold charsiew from this place reeks of oil and pork, but once heated up again, its delicious LOL. Also  there's more to this place than just char siew, duck and chicken, although these are definitely the highlights.

The Roast pork seems to be more fattening than the roast pork I had at other places. You can look at the pictures that other people have posted on yelp to confirm my observation.  Also, I think there's too much sauce on the rice.

Within the hour this place filled up like mad! It definitely had more of a lounge vibe than some of the more traditional ramen spots. My vegan miso ramen was very flavorful, full of all the fixings and all in all delicious. We got the shitake appetizer from the bites, which came with big pieces of toasted bread. But the appetizer was basically hummus with 3 pieces of charred shitakes up top. It was a totally bizarre dish tbh. It ate Mediterranean in flavor, and was way too heavy on bread before consuming ramen. Happy I tried a new spot, but I'll be returning to the more traditional ramen spots around the neighborhood instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonchin-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Zhang C.,/user_details?userid=lHFLFIc0DT1phaJlfFg3Yw,"Queens, NY",1/10/2023,4.0,"For a fast food style restaurant, you order and pay at the counter after you get seated. There were many selection of beers and wine listed on the wall. Fairly simple menu with limited selection of items. It was like going to a upscale Popeyes or KFC. We had almost all the items from the menu. 3 pieces of regular size fried chicken with 2 sides costed $27. A burger was decent priced around $10. I personally preferred the burger over the fried chicken. The fried chicken's flavors were super intensely and too oily. The original had the least oil and the spicy chicken was super oily, it was dipped in hot oil after the chicken was done frying. The egg covered fried chicken was not much of difference from the hot oil dipped chicken, the egg was always an oil sucking and form a super oily skin of the chicken. The chicken itself was super crispy which that was good. The sides were my favorite. I recommend getting the string bean, the bean and the rice. Those can help you simulate with the oiliness from the chicken. Overall I am not a fan of oiliness food and I am not expecting myself to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pecking-house-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jonathan T.,/user_details?userid=Rasj7fpxmimkHLix38Djeg,"Brooklyn, NY",12/4/2022,5.0,"Peking House started off as a waitlist a couple years ago. I was on that waitlist religiously. I also had the privilege of eating at the OG location in Queens. Eric has long been an awesome chef carving out a name for his incredible fried chicken and while the fried chicken is incredible, all the other dishes he offers is just as amazing Eric already knows that I live for his bone broth. Every time I go, I order quarts and quarts and quarts to go. This time I got to visit his new restaurant located closer to me than the last location. I wasn't sure what to expect. I was hoping that the place had not become gentrified or too hipster, which normally happens to good restaurants. Luckily, the food is just as incredible as it was back in Queens. I am lucky that I have access to some of the best fried chicken in the world spicy is the way to go however, if you have children, you can always order the spicy Szechuan oil on the side and pour it over your own piece This time I also tried the salty egg fried chicken, which was absolutely incredible. Not sure if my Asian heritage is the reason why I love it so much but it is definitely something worth trying. If you are feeling adventurous, the dirty rice is the same race they had in queens as are the fried brussels sprouts both simply amazing. Add the start of the show it's always the broad, bean side, savory, crunchy serve cold, and absolutely delicious. I am not usually a fan of beans like this, but these are delicious and I highly recommend you try them. The bone broth itself is the perfect cure for a cold, the flu, world, peace, and pretty much anything else wrong in your life, loaded with ginger and white pepper. It will shock you back into a state of absolute happiness also ordered the spicy chicken sandwich as well as the regular fried chicken sandwich with foie gras on top of it. The foie gras was absolutely incredible served fresh, and a really large portion for the up  charge. All in all this restaurant is incredible. I'm glad that they are back and will gladly give my business to them that as much as possible. Come try this place out. If you like fried chicken it is probably some of the best that you can get don't forget a couple years ago. There was a wait list of about 10,000 people for this chicken and if you try it you'll understand why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pecking-house-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Richard W.,/user_details?userid=NPgFxhnx0kku4ZA8bFhDig,"Bloomington, IN",3/17/2023,3.0,"With all the good reviews and an interesting menu, I thought this was worth a try. My first attempt was the Ma Po Tofu sloppy Joe, just because it sounded so good. I was disappointed - without the Szechuan pepper or soft tofu, it really lacked flavor and texture. Hard tofu might make structural sense, but along with a slice of avocado, it really did not work.  So since the chicken is top of their list, I did not give up and tried the fried chicken, one with hot chili and the other with salted egg. The chicken was way over-cooked, over-salted and unsatisfying. Yes it had a nice crust and a good crunch, but the salted egg sauce was too skimpy to make any impact, and while the chili was spicy, it didn't have much else going for it with everything so over-cooked. The breast meat was still dry and stringy.  The bean salad on the side was the best thing, and the mac and cheese cornbread was mostly just cornbread.

In hindsight, it's a love it or don't (but not hate) kind of fusion experience. I personally didn't love any of it despite my trying to mitigate my own expectations. The chicken was juicy. The spicy crust was plenty oily and spicy. But the combo wasn't for me. The salted egg was interesting in that it was like a creamy crust. I guess what I love about fried chicken is the chicken skin and the batter ruined it for me. Not the fault of Peking House. I just really wanted Popeyes. Oh well. The sides were ok.

The pasta is fresh, flavorful, and delicious with a thoughtful combination of flavors and textures. My friend added the $6 burrata to hers and that was definitely the way to go.

Keeley G.,/user_details?userid=SVTH55FF5eXW4n_TBF39Ow,"New York, NY",1/6/2023,4.0,There are a few different La Pecora Bianca locations in Manhattan. I'd heard that this Bryant park location was a great option for a midtown work lunch so I decided to give it a try. The options are a bit expensive but such is midtown Manhattan pricing. I love that you can add burrata to any pasta of your choice! My dining companion had the same order of rigatoni with burrata and we both agreed it was an enjoyable dish. I absolutely loved the Brussel sprouts. It's a really large portion considering it's a side. We shared it between the 2 of us and did not finish.

A couple of my friends got the Garganelli so I was able to try that too, and I actually enjoyed it over the Rigatoni so next time I'm coming, I'd probably order that one! One friend also got the Toscano salad and added salmon to it, I thought it was also a great dish. Perfect if you want something lighter for your meal! We got 1 order of the Local Burrata as an appetizer and I loved the burrata paired with the sweet figs.

One dish Gramigna, curly pasta dish was outstanding.  It tasted just like we were in Italy.  They did not have a good selection of drinks or cocktails, otherwise it would have been a 5 star review.  Service was great & location was awesome.  if you're in Manhattan, near 41st & 5th avenue, I highly recommend La Pecora Bianca.  Don't forget Online reservation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We didn't mind but it took her 10 minutes after catering to them to get our order. Our appetizer comes out I asked her if we can get more bread she said sure but was hesitant. By this time its been 20 minutes and we have not received our bread or seen her. Our entree comes out and not once did she even acknowledge us but asks the table next to us multiple time if their food was good or if they needed a refill or anything, but she never once came to our table after taking our order.

We were able to make a same day reservation which was great. We arrived early and were seated right away. Advice right off the bat - if it is cold outside (it was 37° when we went) DO NOT let them seat you anywhere near the door. Every time someone opened that door we were blasted with ice cold air. I had to put my coat and scarf back on while we were dining, which I would not usually do but it was just freezing with the door constantly opening. We got the meatball appetizer. I would consider the meatballs and sauce to be average. I ordered the tagliagelle pasta and it was fantastic. I ate every bite. My husband got the strip steak and said it was mediocre. Service left a lot to be desired. My husband was half way through his steak before they brought him a steak knife. He also had fries with his steak and was not offered anything like ketchup for them. He was also never offered a refill of the tiny glass of soda they brought him.  While I really enjoyed my entree I don't think we would return here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered a bunch of appetizers, love the meatballs, burrata (with figs), zucchini fries and roasted cauliflower. The quality was awesome,great combination of the ingredients and tasted fresh. For mains, me and one of my friends ordered pasta, really love the sauce and the texture of the pasta, flavorful and chewy. For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu for 4, it came with a cute sheep on the top, super creamy and smooth. The waiters and waitresses were welcoming and attentive. Overall, we were very happy about the dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was not aware that this place was fancy and was worried I was underdressed. I was here on a Friday afternoon and it was packed! The service was impeccable, they definitely know how to do hospitality. There was a table next to me (the table was a bit close to me, but everyone had to be vaxxed to eat at this location), and the table returned an appetizer due to a health concern and shortly after the manager came by to ask what was wrong and if they could do anything to turn around the experience. When I observed this, I was blown away because not a lot of restaurants do that! Even if it was just a health concern/allergy that the person wasn't even upset with, they still checked in on the customer. As for the food, the pasta I had was delicious and I had the olive oil cake which I have been hunting down for since I had a friend that shared an olive oil cake slice. The place is super clean, very elegant and the staff is super friendly.

I went in with a group of four friends - we had a reservation - and they seated us quickly, which was nice. Once we went to order, the waitress pointedly asked one of my friends, who had ordered a FULL MAIN as her meal, if that would be enough food and that she should get an appetizer (to be clear, none of the rest of us ordered appetizers or received this comment). My friend was flustered and agreed... and ended up being served at least 3x the amount of food of the rest of us, which she couldn't finish. When she asked for a box, our server literally rolled her eyes at her and begrudgingly obliged. The server spent the entire second half of the meal being incredibly rude to all of us in general, rolling her eyes a ton - and to the point where we were all commenting on it because we were so shocked at the behavior. The server also brought us still instead of tap water, which we hadn't asked for, and ended up charging us $27 for WATER ALONE. Finally, we wanted to order desert for the table. When my same friend went to order, the waitress again asked her if she thought that would be enough because the dish was very small while glaring rudely AGAIN!! - As if this poor girl hadn't just been forced into ordering an appetizer she didn't want, couldn't finish her main, and now just wanted a bite of a dessert that we were planning to share. The waitress was clearly trying to make a larger tip off of us by forcing us to order more, and we left shocked at the behavior. Will not be returning.

However, I have never had a positive experience with a server (across two locations). Most notably, this restaurant is very difficult and inflexible when it comes to dietary restrictions. I have a dairy allergy and have run into many challenges with getting a meal that meets my needs given the inflexibility of the servers and the menu. Further, the servers are often downright rude - I've gotten very negative reactions from servers when questioning about my allergy, and our sever last night completely forgot our appetizer and was disrespectful when we questioned about how long the food was taking. I definitely would not recommend this restaurant (at any location) and have no intention of returning again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Suzanne T.,/user_details?userid=tIw9FxrLUkDJu3xWruC6fA,"Saddle River, NJ",12/11/2022,1.0,"I Visited La Pecora in Bryant Park, today, December 11th, for a Christmas lunch with my daughters and their friends.  I was very disappointed with the service.  We waited over an hour for our food and they forgot our appetizers and delivered them after our entrees.  I would have been willing to accept slower service because it is Christmas in New York, but, when the waiter came back to fill our water he dropped my glasses of water and it shattered all over our food and table.  I was soaking wet and my daughter's friend sat on a piece of glass and ripped her tights. They cleaned up the food that was wet but never brought us new water.  As an apology for the spill and shattered glass they offered us two single scoops of gelato to share between 5 of us.  I decided to complain to the other manager and after he asked the server what happened, he came back to the table with the impression that we caused the spill.  In the end I explained that it was the server, not us that spilled the water and broke the glass and he ended up comping our dinner.  I understands that accidents happen and that places are busy at Christmas time, what was unacceptable was: 1. The server placed blame on us for the spill and broken glass 2. Our water was never replaced so we had no drinks and the glass was never cleaned up from around my seat and the water with glass in it was never removed.  Very disappointed in this experience!  Additionally, the female manager, Rea - (she would not give us her name loud enough for us to hear) did not assist in solving the problem, after the accident, the team scattered and left us to fend for ourselves, we sat at 2:45 and did not leave the restaurant until 4:50.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The vodka sauce rigatoni was excellent, and so was the chicken milanese (I personally especially liked the salad that came on the plate with the chicken).

A C.,/user_details?userid=yU_HLaC6X2wlV0biHAh5cA,"Irvine, CA",4/6/2022,1.0,"All I can say is that the food was mediocre at best. We were a table of 8, for a birthday dinner on a sunday night. We had a reservation so we were seated immediately but they stopped us on the way in because we had cake. I asked them if they could hold onto it for us while we were eating dinner and asked if we could celebrate with the cake after dinner. They said there was a cake cutting fee of $5 per person..... and even if ""cut"" it ourselves, there's a fee for even if we want to eat it in the restaurant. We ended up not having cake together because we had already ordered an overpriced meal per person and a bottle of wine. The food was okay but it definitely was NOT good enough to be priced that high. I got a brussel salad and their most popular rigatoni which there are plenty of pictures on here. The rigatoni was just normal and there wasn't anything special that made it stand out. The brussel salad was fine too, the sauce and taste overall was a bit strong and I didn't like that the raisins were pickled but that's just me. We had a pizza to share in the middle and it was not hot at all, it was a cooled down temperature with a super thin middle and thick crust. Not my preference but maybe others like their pizzas like that .... To each their own I guess. Overall, the servers weren't too attentive even though we had clearly been one of the larger tables and one of the only tables celebrating a birthday. In the past, I have been to so many more restaurants have made efforts to make a birthday dinner that much more special because we chose to have it at their restaurant. I just remember leaving the restaurant feeling unsatisfied and disappointed by everything-- especially the fact that they don't have bread as an appetizer!!! One of the best parts of an Italian restaurant is the yummy bread with olive oil and balsamic and LPB did not have it at all. Not even available to order as a side. So disappointing and mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My daughter and I shared a bottle of their own label dry rose; it was a perfect accompaniment to our very different shared entrees.  The branzino with Swiss chard was a winner - lemony and salty/savory with the addition of capers. Our other choice was the tagliatelle - also delicious.  The only complaint is that the serving dishes should have been hot. The food cooled down too quickly. We also ordered a side of the roasted Brussel sprouts.  These were amazing! For dessert we shared the tiramisu for two - delicious but really can feed four or five people! (Not complaining - lol - enjoyed the leftovers the next day) Finally ended with an espresso martini - best one ever! This is a very convenient location close to GCT.

The location Inside of WholeFoods took a little time for use to find, but the hunt was worth it. We tried the nachos, tacos, enchilada and horchata. The horchata was the only thing I might not order again, it was just ok, and didn't have quite the right balance of flavor of horchata that I'm used to - maybe it wasn't sweet enough, but it also didn't seem to have enough cinnamon, and there was another flavor in it that didn't belong that I couldn't put my finger on. The nachos were the star, as was the vegan chorizo taco. The salsa verse was a tad too sour, but everything else was excellent. The service was prompt and friendly. The area had a unique decor from the rest of the Whole Foods market so it felt like it's own separate space.

Upmanu L.,/user_details?userid=mMYP4Z-koUZ0pBu2Vsi4zg,"Manhattan, NY",12/12/2021,1.0,"overcharged and no vaccination check. We went to this place based on the reviews and past experience at another location. It was not crowded and it is located inside a Whole Foods. We ordered 3 Tacos each for 2 people. You pay at the counter and then sit down. No one asked to see our vaccination status, even though there were signs posted that they would check. After the food came, we were discussing that it tasted good and was well priced given the location.  As per the Menu the Tacos were $8 for 2 and $3 for a third one = $11 for 3. I had paid $28.30+15% tip at the counter (=$32.54) and opted for no receipt on their checkout device. This did not seem to be right, since we should have paid $22 + tax (8.85%) = $23.95. So, I went and talked to the checkout person. She rang up 3 tacos and informed me that it was $13. I pointed out that this did not match the printed menu or  the menu on the board above the checkout. She was dismissive and said that the menu was wrong in that case since the prices in her device were correct. I pointed out that this was not a good situation and they should fix the menu prices to reflect what they were going to charge. Her reply was she will pass my comment on to the management. I have never run into a restaurant with such deceptive pricing policies. We and likely most customers rarely check the details of the bill so likely they can get away with this kind of practice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/jajaja-mexicana-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ordered the chicken mushroom chili wonton and the beef noodle. The beef noodle was good, a solid 3/5 but the wonton is under cook and have this doughy taste. First i thought nothing of it since it's my first time having this place, by the 3rd piece i realize there's no way a thin wonton skin can be this chewy and doughy then that's when i break apart the wonton and inspect it. The dough was definitely under-cook which pretty much mean i had atleast 2.5 under-cook chicken meat wontons. I know i ordered the food kinda late but damn, atleast make sure the food is cook before you clock out.

Angela L.,/user_details?userid=qds0RgNCDa2D2t9E4rH2tA,"Midtown East, New York, NY",11/19/2021,4.0,"Popped by on a Friday night with a friend when everything was booked in town and glad I did! They had a seat for us immediately and there was relatively short wait to receive our food - maybe 10 minutes or so. We got the Pan Fried Pork Buns which had a nice crispy bottom and were slightly juicy on the inside. I thought the Spicy Pork Wontons were very much on the mild side but flavorful enough. Our favorite dish was the Sautéed String Beans as it came with a slightly sweet dark soy sauce mix and very tender. The only disappointment was the dan dan noodles as they lacked flavor. Overall, I loved what they did with the space for a casual and chill dinner - very modern, clean, and spacious especially for New York. The decor is a mix of neutral tones and some modern Chinese photography on the wall. The bathroom is clean, always a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/3-times-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

A little disappointed to see that the LES restaurant didn't have a lot of the entrees on their social media page. I I ordered the crispy croaker rolls instead, its basically fish wrapped in fried bean curd skin. It has a very crispy shell, the fish inside is steamed tender, it almost melts in the tongue. The only thing I dislike is so much oil is used to fry the roll, there was so much oil I could see it dripping. They give a sauce to soak up the oil; which I find in dismay is something like thousand islands sauce, quite thick and tangy, which doesn't help lessen the oily taste of the fried bean curd skin at all. Me recommendation would be to serve it with a sour or spicy sauce in the future?...the Tangyuan were fine, nothing special, I don't think it was handmade, but just be bought from supermarkets instead, but still a decent meal",https://www.yelp.com/biz/3-times-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Their signature dish Shi-bing-tong is like Chinese version of savory crepe with different fillings inside but skin is more crispy. It was very good. Their dumplings were also very good. Filling and skin proportion was good unlike some other place that  has very thick skin with little filling.  Noodles were quite impressive also. It's different from the usual lo-mien. It's not oily, simple with noodle and topping but it was very good. Staffs were very friendly and they have plenty of seats.

Joseph T.,/user_details?userid=Cns9kEt9-9wmuvUg3jNz7A,"Brooklyn, NY",7/18/2022,1.0,"I have eaten here on two different occasions with the most recent being 7/17/2022. My girlfriend and I decided to revisit this place after we had come two years ago for my birthday since we didn't get to try the pasta. We sat in their garden area towards the back right of the restaurant. I will say, the pasta did not disappoint. However, the reason for my 1-star review was the rats that were running around behind us. I didn't get through all my pasta when I noticed them and from that moment I couldn't eat anymore. Some other guests there also noticed the rats and one of them even went up to the area where they were to try to get a better look. When I called our waiter over and discreetly mentioned the issue, he nonchalantly told us ""Well, this is Brooklyn. There is nothing I can do about it"". He then asked if we wanted to move inside instead of apologizing about it first. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there so we requested the check. For them to give us a response like that knowing that is a clear health violation that can get the business shut down is unacceptable. It doesn't matter what borough you are in. A visual sign of rats is a clear indication of what is happening inside the restaurant and if it has a chance to affect my food?

Christina G.,/user_details?userid=r2mNNrfcq97V-qaK1taI1A,"Franklin Square, NY",9/13/2020,2.0,"So we did not have a reservation but fortunately we were still able to get a table. My first impression of the place is that they have beautiful greenery but once I interacted with the host he was very snippy and I guess he had his friends at a table because I saw him go over there to sneak a sip to drink a few times. Anyway we were seated on the side walk which was still fine but it took the waitress awhile just to bring water to us and also to even bring the mixed drinks we ordered over. The drinks we had were nothing to rave about. We ordered the croquettes to start and they were delicious but the fried calamari we ordered was dry and oily. For dinner I ordered the ravioli and it was actually pretty decent, we also got skirt steak and it was good but the quantity of the dish was lacking. There was a few slices of steak on a plate but not much to eat. Overall I'm giving this place a 2 star because the hospitality was lacking, waitress was lacking, and food was just ok. At this price point the standards should be higher. A little disappointed but maybe next time my experience will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The crab was seasoned and tasted so succulent the greens were so complimented on the dish that it was as perfectly paired as a pb+j sandwich. My boy Sebastian had the short rib burger, looking at the juices flow on that bad boy i said I'll risk it all, Covid? Bring it! I bit in to that bad boy and fell in to a delicious sea of tenderness and perfect seasoning, it was as awesome as encountering your first burger, Revolutionary. The salmon eggs Benedict were also so delicious, the smoked capers placed on top were so crunchy and the tomato complimented the salmon perfectly!

I was so excited to try this place because the decor was really cute but the food and service was terrible. Not once did our waiter come and ask if we were ok or if we needed anything else. We waited about 20-30 mins before we ordered because our waiter was not around. We got the calamari to share, it was alright nothing special. We all got pasta, I forgot the name of the dish but it was absolutely awful!!!! It was soooo salty we barely could eat it, of course our waiter did not bother to ask how the food was. We all left our plate of pasta full because it was just honestly not edible, I could make the dish better myself. I am so disappointed and will definitely not be returning.

Anup R.,/user_details?userid=ORUSfeLmO-l8M9kjmyqjng,"Chicago, IL",3/27/2017,5.0,Came here for Sunday brunch before going bowling. The outdoor enclosed garden area was great. Our party got seated quickly. Pomepelmo was a good take on a mojito. They give you bread while waiting for your entrees which was delicious. Soft inside and crunchy outside and were quick with refills. The entrees were tasty. I got the Parma eggs Benedict which the waiter said was the most popular dish and I can see why. Only thing is the side salad is useless. It's just a few greens with no dressing on the plate. Would rather have a couple more potatoes. Fiancé got the eggs florentine which was equally as good. Definitely recommend this place for a regular non boozy brunch in Williamsburg.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was still busy even at around close to 11 by the time we left but then again it's Saturday night in Brooklyn. The place is nice and they have a charming outdoor seating area. For appetizers we ordered the octopus which was great and fried zucchini blossoms stuffed with mozzarella cheese and anchovy which was amazing. Too bad it's only a special for the night because it was delicious. Sadly my squid ink pasta entree was terrible. It was so fishy tasting. It was overwhelmingly fishy. I forced myself to not breathe and eat a few bites because I didn't want to offend them if they saw that I didn't touch my food (I am way too polite at restaurants..Sometimes to my own detriment). I've had squid ink pasta so many times at so many different places so I have no idea why this one had such a fishy taste. Maybe it was the clams??

I had a home made saffron pasta with shrimp ragu. It had a distinct flavour of sea, in a good way, and the pasta was cooked al dente. A great pasta dish. My husband had spaghetti vongole- also good but it as memorable. The service was superb throughout. We got a wine recommended that was great with our food.

It's comfortable, natural lighting through large windows. The staff are down to earth, casually dressed, very comfortable vibe. There's optional outdoor seating in the summer...or a closed outdoor seating area in the winter. I think they make their own pasta in house. The flavors of their dishes are really well put together. For brunch I had a salmon dish. It came with avocado, cured salmon, goat cheese, poached egg on a whole wheat bread. Very good. Overall, they use simple but good ingredients to make outstanding dishes and I highly recommend. The prices are moderate. The bill was $95 for three dishes, one appetizer(heirloom squash it was sweet and salty), one drink(mimosa) and 2 lemonades. Lemonade was $4 each. Tasted fresh as if it was homemade. Overall, I would keep coming back to try everything on the menu (besides beef or pork).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The eggs Benedict with Parma and ricotta was rich and delicious, exactly what you want for brunch. The polenta with eggs, kale and mushrooms was perhaps my favorite. Say yes to the side order of bacon, which was sliced and cooked to perfection. More like a tasty crispy strip of pork belly. Such an excellent balance of flavors. I cleaned my plate.

We originally chose this spot because it has a really lovely outdoor garden area, but it ended up being booked out for a private party. The inside of Aurora is very simple with dark wood floors and tables, brick walls, and minimal decor. I got the paccheri pasta with eggplant and mozzarella- it was delicious and I love how all of their pastas are made in house daily. That is quite a rare thing at most Italian restaurants in New York. The only negative is that there weren't that many exciting options on the menu. It was the very usual eggs benedict, frittata, and burger options.

Nichole K.,/user_details?userid=aFHoc8JGImkeHC65pOrxew,"Brooklyn, NY",6/1/2017,5.0,"I struggled if I wanted to give four stars or five, but ultimately, the bottom line is the food was really good. The service was great. The ambience (we sat outside) was beautiful & so welcoming. The prosciutto was so tender & not slimy which prosciutto can sometimes be. The olive oil they put on the table, on a silky note, was one of my favorite parts. They make their own pasta. I love places that do this. You can tell it to. It really is so much better than dried pasta. The two things I didn't like were the amount they gave you. We had a table of about 15. I looked down the table at the end & everyone's plate was licked clean. Yes, that means they like it, but it also means there were some people probably still hungry. For the price, I believe the portion sizes could be a little bigger. The second thing is the Williamsburg 'your lucky to be eating here' that some of the younger generations foster. Let me explain. They don't want to give you bread with olive oil because it makes the tables too messy and the menus get ruined. The menus are printed on a thick resume type paper. Really. Just print more. We were starving b/c our party got there at 7 & didn't order until 8:30. I don't know whose fault it was. It could have easily been someone at our big table causing the lag, so I can't point fingers. But if one end of the table is telling you they are starving, please oblige. It's a restaurant. This goes back to, 'no, we can't give you a side of fresh fruit even though we serve it as a side on another dish.' Mentality, that makes me mad. One reason people go out to eat is because of choices. Enough of my rant. I would eat here again. Although not if I was really hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sam M.,/user_details?userid=DvkkNm6I3iNYVAKzEl2WgQ,"New York, NY",4/14/2018,5.0,"With an hour to spare before a movie at Nitehawk, my date and I were looking for a close spot to grab dinner. We walked by Aurora which was pretty empty (it was around 6pm on a Friday) and decided to go in. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and has a lovely outdoor seating area which I highly recommend if you can get it, we were not able to sit outside due to reservations and by 6:30 the entire restaurant was packed so in the future I would make a reservation. Our server was wonderful, very nice and quick which was perfect since we had less than an hour for dinner. I ordered a cocktail called the Darlington, essentially a very upscale vodka tonic which was good but very small for the price. I then chose the Arctic Char, it was on the specials so I don't know how often they have it, but if they do when you go it is a MUST. Perfectly cooked fish, smoothy creamy polenta and amazing charred artichoke hearts. Pure heaven. Date got the fazzoletti with lamb ragù which he said was delicious.

Lauren T.,/user_details?userid=Ds0Mjr2BubDjvknxwoDevw,"Los Angeles, CA",3/2/2014,5.0,"One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. Both brunch and dinner get five stars. The food is delicious. Service is always prompt and friendly, and the ambiance is great. I love the cozy inside and outdoor garden. It also never seems to get extremely crowded and it's actually a pretty good sized restaurant which I like. I hate sitting on top of people next to me.

Melissa B.,/user_details?userid=g5ey_hlO9xmViRv8omAX6A,"Manhattan, NY",10/12/2015,5.0,"2 weeks ago I had my Sunday afternoon wedding here.  I was looking for a rustic outdoor brooklyn wedding venue and found this on google.  The images I found from past weddings were so beautiful I had to check it out.  The food is all delicious and the portions are good.  The place itself is so pretty with the fresh ivy and exposed brick you don't need a lot of decorations.  I worked with Irene from their events team throughout the process and she was always there to answer any questions I had, plus she is super sweet.  My wedding was a perfect success and my friends and family couldn't stop talking about how lovely the place was and how amazing all the food was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Gee L.,/user_details?userid=LkwpTUySJ25ejSnTsfEUHA,"West Palm Beach, FL",3/27/2016,3.0,"Typical hipster place in Williamsburg. It's cute and rustic but like a typical hipster DB place, they wouldn't seat the entire party without everyone being present. It was Easter Sunday morning at 11AM and quiet. I told my party to go ahead and just start ordering and eating. They did. It was filling up by the time I got there but I ordered and the rest of the party ordered coffee/tea. I got a green fave bean salad which I finished rather quickly. It looked promising and fresh, but I'm not sure what ingredients they used. I started coughing a bit (I'm allergic to preservatives) so I'm convinced something in there - maybe their dressing - was NOT fresh. Waitstaff was pleasant but they wanted us out. This place is nothing special and with so many other places around, don't go out of your way to come here - especially from Queens - unless your friend who is leaving back to Japan selected the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
