Lena R.,/user_details?userid=Y5nJZYDlhTFyy8saL3UvzA,"New York, NY",3/26/2023,5.0,"Osteria Brooklyn is an Italian restaurant in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn New York. A warm and cozy setting that sets the mood for an authentic Italian eatery. It was founded by Executive Chef Raffaele Solinas. Chef Solinas came to New York City with a suitcase packed with 45 knives and a heart mission that was ready to cook. He started his culinary journey in Sardinia. He later moved to Manhattan where he worked his way towards success. Chef Solinas has a great knowledge of Italian cuisine and the trends of the New York City market. His establishment is well recognized and genuinely favorable. How was it?:  I had the ""Clinton Hill"" cocktail, made with tequila, pineapple, and lime. The lime itself was literally set on fire and left for me to blow out. I also had the ""House Specialty Fried Oysters"". A fried oyster and zucchini appetizer topped with bourbon tartare sauce. For the entree I had the ""Pappardelle and Ossobuco"", made with lamb shank, goat cheese, and pestata. So delicious! The lamb was cooked to perfection over pappardelle, a tomato-like sauce, and crumbles of goat cheese to finish",https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-brooklyn-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

As for the dessert which was advertised as a chocolate soufflé which I'm expecting to be light and airy, it turned out to be a dry chocolate cake.  Thank goodness there was gelato on top to give it more moisture.  Overall, I think the food was ok but wouldn't go out of my way to go back since there are so many better Italian restaurants in Brooklyn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-brooklyn-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Im obsessed with truffles, I wanted so badly to eat the fettuccini and experience the table side cheese wheel--but my server never did it. Its written on the menu, (table side)-- what a bust. I was so disappointed. You cant even say it wasnt done because it was busy--the other server did it for his table. The infamous pasta tasted like truffle oil-infused milk.

Of the appetizers, my absolute favorite was Fritto Misto which has Fried Calamari, Shrimp, Zucchini. This is SUPERB showcasing fresh and crispy seafood, but I also loved the addition of the fried zucchini. It comes with a nice spicy red sauce for dipping which is personally a must have for fried calamari for me! As for entrees: the red wine fettuccine pasta and zuppa di pesce stole the show. The pasta dish has a rich sauce on homemade pasta with shaved fresh truffle. The zuppa is a show with a spectacular dish hiding under this peel away bread.

Christopher N.,/user_details?userid=7cra5xzN-a72SAlEiET7iQ,"Brooklyn, NY",9/29/2021,4.0,"I've visited Osteria three times now and generally had fairly positive experiences, but unfortunately had to knock it down 1 star for my last visit. To start with the positive, I had been before for a Valentine's dinner this year when things were starting to open up and we were able to do indoor dining. Great! The food was excellent, service was good, and it was nice to feel normal and eat inside on a cold night. Visited another time and also had a similar experience. I was even saying to my partner that for our area, Osteria is definitely my go-to nice Italian restaurant for dinner. Unfortunately my last experience wasn't nearly as satisfying but I will give the benefit of the doubt because something was definitely off. Our server seemed out of her element, like maybe she was a hostess who was asked to wait tables due to someone calling out? We ordered a carafe of the Osteria cocktail which the server didn't seem to understand. Even after pointing to it on the menu she seemed somewhat confused. It wasn't until I believe the owner/chef came over and clarified with us that we got the drinks, which were tasty. We ordered two appetizers and ultimately ended up not receiving one of them.. it was forgotten and thankfully not included on the bill, but that was somewhat disappointing. Then we asked another server (who also seemed out of his element) for more bread which never came. The pasta dishes we ordered were very tasty! I have no complaints about the food as it is always delicious, but something was definitely off the last time I visited which [figuratively] left a bad taste in my mouth. I would like to return again in the future to give Osteria another chance as my first two visits were very positive, but if this had been my first visit I would likely not return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/osteria-brooklyn-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It had wine stains on the label and the label on the back was torn. It also wasn't the wine we ordered. The foil had already been cut before it came to the table. When we asked about the server said it was because the wine attendant was clumsy and had spilled wine all over. The table next to us was served a bottle of wine that was also clearly not sealed. When we asked our waiter he said he would ask and they only charged us for two glasses of house wine.

Me Random C.,/user_details?userid=3-ANzvYNK7pNhZ5OXNg3WQ,"Portland, OR",8/29/2022,5.0,"I made our reservation a week before traveling to NY from Portland, Oregon. To say that I was counting the minutes until this meal would not be an exaggeration! I first had a meal at Osteria Brooklyn in May 2022. That meal was the finest Italian food I have ever enjoyed (and I have had some amazing meals in Italy). Last May, I had two (repeat TWO) salads and lasagna. The caesar was a 10 out of 10 and the Pear/Spinach (INSALATINA DI SPINACI) salad was a 10 out of 10. Then the lasagna... Okay - their lasagna was truly NEXT LEVEL EPIC. Now, fast forward, I'm back. Just enjoyed another over the top meal last night (late Aug. 2022). (Note: It is honestly painful to write this since I already finished my leftover lasagna and THEIR lasagna remains my all-time favorite Italian meal.) This visit, I tried a new salad (a sign that I really trust their menu - I am the type that sticks with a proven thing for years before exploring the menu). Last night I tried the apple salad (OSTERIA SPECIAL APPLE SALAD) - okay - another winner! I also tried the beef meatball appetizer served atop polenta which had a euphoric combination of cheeses whipped into it. Amazing. I think anyone reading this will get the point - this place has won my heart. There are no restaurants that come close to delighting me in Portland, Oregon to the level that Osteria Brooklyn ranks. THANK you for another great meal! Next time I must try whatever you are creating in that huge round of cheese. I saw two table-side preparations with fire emanating from a cheese round - YES yelp reader, the pasta was being prepped in a cheese round! Thank you Osteria Brooklyn - I can't wait to come back even if it means I must move my son out of his college dorm just to dine with you! Sitting down to a meal at your restaurant was the prize for moving my son out and into his college dorm. My son goes to Pratt and I go to Osteria Brooklyn! I say that's a win win. Thanks for being so delicious. Your vibe is great and I find it's a major comfort to dine with you. Note: No photos. This meal was just something to internalize -- I had no interest in taking pictures!

Same male server came out to us tonight ( we were outside because we had our dog there), the male server psyched himself up behind my husband, in full view of my son and I, to talk to us, then saw our dog , proceeded to tell us he worked ""in the narcotics division"" and showed us a fake toy button pretending it was a police badge. All with a straight face. We let that go. We ordered. My husband ordered first. He then turned to my husband 2 seconds later and said ""and for you?""., er he's the only one that ordered. He took the order and walked away, without the menus , but tripping up as he went. He then came back a few mins later and said ""are you ready to order?"". We said we just did. He walked away. A few minutes later a young white girl came out, took my order ( again), walked back in then came out and said ""sorry can I take the full order he didn't get it"", we said yup, we knew it, he's so high. Eventually we get out meals, one of them not correct but at this stage we were amazed we actually got food. Another girl took over , my son and husband ordered second beers, I declined. When we got the bill, I wrote on the bill, no tip as the guy was so high, he didn't even know he'd talked to us, twice! In 15 mins!!! I also wrote the young girl saved him. We were the only people eating outside. With few people inside. As we got up to leave, another guy came out, obviously trying to smooth this farce over, I asked if he's the manager. Twice. He appeared just as high, but claimed he was the chef ( in the same  black tshirt as the servers?) I said the food was great but the male server is a joke, he was way too high to be front of house.

Nesie B.,/user_details?userid=RXyK_ut3E6N1UMgO0REY4g,"Brooklyn, NY",12/4/2021,1.0,"Service and attitude can really make or break the dining experience. Unfortunately, both are lacking at Osteria. After being extremely patient with our server and service, I had to call the restaurant and let the owner know we were still waiting for TWO entrees at our table after only one was brought out. It took so long for service that the one entree that had come out was completely eaten by the time we had been fed up and called (by phone) to say our food had not come out. The server was apologetic and blamed this huge oversight on a large party. By that time we had been at the table for TWO hours, and could not stay to wait for the food to be prepared after waiting long periods of time between each interaction with the server. I said we would pay for whatever food came out and call it a day. The owner came to the table and asked if everything was okay (but knew it wasn't because I had spoke to him on the phone). When I said no, he put the blame on the server and said ""he never put the order in"" and WALKED AWAY! He didn't apologize or show any respect towards patrons of his restaurant. I would never come to this restaurant again or suggest it to anyone. The terrible service and the disregard for patrons is appalling.
