While the cocktail list and cocktails themselves were fine, I'd grab your beer of choice or a classic cocktail and snag a seat at the bar. From there, I'd order the broccoli tacos (they pack a ton of flavor on their own but the add a few dashes of the sauce they'll bring out and it's a flavor explosion) and also a side of fries (as long as you like em McDonalds style). That's it - that's the order. If you absolutely must have a larger meal, I think the fried chicken sandwich was quite tasty. Tried the cheeseburger too but it was very minimalistic and frankly, very rare - didn't taste like much else than... meat. *shrugs*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/no-7-brooklyn-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

From the decor, the little story behind it, the servers were absolutely great (knowledgeable, friendly and funny!), and of course the food! All of the fish we had was super fresh, with some even being flown in that morning and prepared for the evening we were there. What I loved compared to other Omakase we've been to, is they use very little rice with the fish. They really highlight the taste of the fish as well as how they prepare it. Instead of feeling bloated and super full halfway through the tasting, by the end of the 21 courses, we felt very satisfied without feeling super full. Again, this was easily the freshest fish I've ever had at an Omakase or sushi in general. Don't want to give too much away, since the story behind Mr. Moto and the way this restaurant does everything, is a very cool experience.

There was about 3,000 servers working but no one was really working? We were in no rush and I'm not an impatient person but after waiting an hour for our first appetizer I was a little bit like y'all good back there? Food was okay. I ordered the fish which had a nice flavor but it was just a quarter sized slab of fish swimming in broth. I asked for some rice on the side to eat with it bc ur girl needs substance, but after 40 minutes of waiting I canceled it and ate my lil fish in ab three bites. Is this how the Williamsburg girls stay so fit? I also got the salad that had savory granola on top which was v weird and soggy. Anyway!

I first had this dish at Sunnin in west LA and found it appealing. Yara has one with cracked wheat which adds an interesting texture and with more fresh garnishes. It didn't have as much flavor as I remember but that's ok. Their babaganoush is a little more  sour than I'm used to also. We also tried a chicken and vegetable stew that i can't recall the name of. It's a little upscale restaurant but everything was well plated and fresh. Other aspects of the menu didn't stick out to me as much.

They gave us a complementary dessert for the birthday girl and I take a bite and there is a literally a piece of a wire brush. The owner Linda was so sweet about the situation but it's still unresolved. We waited almost 30 minutes to get our check.

Hussein S.,/user_details?userid=1_Gkz2e_17feDxF14LYxrw,"Queens, Queens, NY",8/1/2019,5.0,I been to a few places in the city where they serve Hala food and they are really few of them but hands down Yara is one of my favorite  very Elegant setting but what really made me fall in love is the food I can sincerely say is as good as the authentic home made Lebanese food that you get from your mother hands .. I was really hungry and didn't have nothing but breakfast so we went all in me and my brother we order basically the whole menu the hummus with the meat and the pine nuts was amazing as well the fattoush salad we also got the falafel they where crispy and delicious so was the sambosek but when I got the vegan Kibbe I thought is going to be some okay experiment on an traditional Lebanese food but I was surprised it was so good with a lot of flavor I was really impressed. it was the last  thing after that we start with the main dishes my brother had the kibbe labneh and I got the mixed grill I can say the kibbe labneh was very good since we shared everything but the mixed grill was full of flavor and the chicken was juicy not dry at all and the kafta was awesome at this point we can barley breath but we couldn't skip on the desert and as well we want to have the full experience of Yara so we jump in the desert menu we had the Boza which is the ice cream   for me the pistachio and kashta flavor I can't say any more than that highly recommend if u in the mood for an excellent experience and great taste and flavor enjoy ....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yara-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Servers were friendly but that's about it. Generally an establishment would bring you bread and butter before the appetizers -- not in this case. Cocktails and appetizers took too long to arrive. After the cocktails and appetizers were dropped to the table, the main dish took forever to arrive. They also sent our second appetizer after we were half way thru our main dish. Appetizers weren't tasteful but it was edible. The main dishes were nothing new except fancy names. I was expecting a BANG for my buck and the portions were not shareable. Decent prices (which was good because it didn't kill my bank). Overall a bad experience. The only thing that I've probably enjoyed more than the food was the cocktails.

Once you head upstairs for dinner you will find yourself in a beautiful well appointed dining room. Every dish served was made with the freshest ingredients. A good chef shines in the simplest dishes. All were prepared and seasoned beautifully. Warm fluffy pita was put on the table first with an olive oil dip containing zahtar and black olives which was served with pickled turnips on the side. Delish. The hummus, falafel made with beets, babaganoush, cauliflower, moussaka and exceptional grape leaves were all winners. They compromised a meal in itself.

The food in general was just average at best, NOT generous on portion size, no spiciness and light on salt. It was impossible to flag down a waiter also. We didn't get our check in time and had to wait on the boat while people were leaving in order to pay. Would skip eating here next time but the boat ride was nice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-barca-cantina-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You can make a reservation for sailing times which is great since this is on the pier and without reservations who knows if you would be able to get on. The recommendation is that you arrive 15-30 minutes before your sailing time so that you can wait to board and obtain a seat. There are 3 levels with the top level being the most desirable since it is outside. They do have it so that you are able to switch to other levels to continue drinking without having to get off if you're not ready to and to also allow everyone the experience to be on the top of the ship which I think is nice. The food and drinks left a lot to be desired - the tacos were all covered in like a bbq sauce which is just weird. If the meat was seasoned correctly, I don't think that sauce would be necessary.

The ceviche and shrimp cocktail are about 10 oz in size. Ceviche does not come with tostadas and they don't even sell tostadas there.

Shawn W.,/user_details?userid=iaJr1peNjXKihwv1zPRpYA,"Cedar Park, TX",6/24/2022,3.0,This place looks very inviting from the outside as you notice workers in the window cutting and preparing the seafood.  I was excited and debated between their special (half shell crab sandwich) and a lobster roll. I had to pick the lobster roll because the place does have lobster in the name.  I should have went with the special.  The lobster roll was WAY OVERPRICED!  Almost $36 for a normal sized portion that was very chewy and came with a paltry sized chopped lettuce as a side. My daughter got an octopus salad  that was $21 and was fairly small in size itself - but she definitely had the better deal. It seems every place these days is shrinking their portion sizes and increasing the costs for them. The one plus was the service - the serving waitress and another waitress were attentive and friendly but I cannot justify the cost for what I received in quality and quantity.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/greenpoint-fish-and-lobster-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

TQ P.,/user_details?userid=PBwiv1BnRH2MzejAIsb0vw,"Austin, TX",10/27/2017,5.0,Loved it!  I took myself out for dinner and just ran into this little restaurant. I live for seafood and this place looked legit. There is a long bar facing the kitchen and oyster shuckers and a couple of tables. Service was fantastic. Food was great. They were having happy hour so I had 1/2 dozen oysters each at 1.50$ and fish tacos. Delish.

The fish and chips were very crispy however it was under seasoned. The fish tasted like there was no salt at all. The fish pate I enjoyed very much. However i dont know if i would call it a pate because the texture was definitely a tuna salad texture. The corn chowder tasted great but was a little too thin for my taste.

Although they seem to have a large staff, they still seemed pretty occupied at full capacity. On to the food. Mussels, featuring a salty and delicious broth.

David B.,/user_details?userid=i87In5tP4yz3ecqNX216gA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/9/2016,4.0,"The store & selection is small, but the quality seems to be superior. I started off with the crudo, the chef's choice was king salmon, and I will say it is some of the leanest and cleanest (as in finish) king salmon I've had in awhile. Very sublime. It was drizzled in a mellow EVOO and some salt. A squeeze of lemon, by yours truly and we're good to go. I suggest to Greenpoint that they go with a grassier tasting EVOO; because the salmon has such a mellow taste, you kind of want a contrast, which the lemon and salt really don't provide, but are good compliments, nontheless. Next up were the oysters; all tasted as advertised. All cold, briny and fresh. Condiments are not needed; you can go bare-valve on these. My two faves being the ""creamy ones"" from the east coast, and the only west coast from Washington State. I forgot to take down the names. However, when a west coast oyster, eaten in the east coast, has such a clean, sharp grassy front, that it tastes like a well fed lawn just cut smells - as in nose bleed, you know the guy who purchases the oysters knows his $|-|it. If you get the house Clamato, ask them to hold the hot sauce & spice; it covers the taste of the raw bar. In fact, just go with their iced coffee, if you need something to wash down the bivalves.

We said ok were about to walk out and then the waitress said if we waited a few minutes she would check and see if they could serve us. We got drinks while we waited and were seated with 10 min. We sat at the counter and then were ignored for a good 10-15 minutes. It was becoming clear that the waitstaff was totally overwhelmed (the place was busy) and the chefs behind the counter we're visibly tired and pissed off. We were begrudgingly handed a menu and we tried to order ASAP. We ordered 3 lobster rolls and the chef said bitchily ""we are out, I mean u sat down after the kitchen closed.""

In Florida, pretty much every grocery store has big, beautiful displays of fresh and reasonably-priced seafood. And apparently I took that for granted. Because after my move, I definitely realized that I wasn't in ""Kansas"" anymore. I kind of cried a little bit when I realized that the three closest grocery stores to me, C-Town, Key Foods, and Associated Foods, all had ""seafood"" sections that were 2' x 4' worth of refrigerated shelf space with pre-packaged, previously-frozen, scary-looking seafood. C-Town, where I shop the most, frequently seems to run out of salmon. How do you run out of salmon? Anyway... I am so very happy that Greenpoint Fish and Lobster has opened! It fills a much needed void in the neighborhood. No longer do I need to walk a mile plus to Harvest Market in Williamsburg or The Food Cellar in Long Island City, or a mile and a half to Metropolitan Fish in Williamsburg for fish, because I now have my own fabulous fish market right in my own neighborhood!

But I am thinking, this is a highly rated place that serves very fresh seafood. The food in reality was pretty bad. Soup was OK but fish and chips... Ridiculous! This expensive dish includes just small amount of french fries and only two pieces of fish. When you start consuming the ""chips"", you realize that fish is only one third of it, the rest is a nasty oily over-fried breading! So I ended up eating only half of the plate. I must tell you this was a terrible experience for $50! I would be more satisfied by much cheaper fish fillet from nearby McDonalds (not that I consider it to be a decent healthy food).

It's sad to me how entitled, bitter and deluded some of these reviews are about a place that is doing a real service to the community where no one else has shown much interest. Unfortunately, its become that kind of neighborhood lately, where people would rather complain about any less than perfect experience than appreciate the effort.

My friend made a reservation for Saturday at 5:30 and we were able to be seated right away. All the staff was very nice, we really liked the ambiance and the decor, one thing that was funny was the little water cup, now they did keep our cups filled but it was just enough to take a swallow of water before someone had to come back around and fill it up again. Now this menu is very unique and besides some things like guacamole this menu looked nothing like I'd ever seen in a Mexican restaurant, now that's not really a bad thing because the food was really good and of great quality, we got the guacamole which instead of being served with tortilla chips was served with 3 tortillas that were of the same consistency of a chip, no complaints it was great and had a little spice to it, you can tell they didn't over do it with salt and instead used herbs and spices, that's important to me. We got the duck appetizer which was unique and good, we also got the Taco De Trompo which also was good but really $9 for a taco? Now it was unique I have to give them that but really overpriced in my opinion, we shared the Asado which is a 26 oz steak, it's served with some cheese with fig we think and tortillas also with a green sauce, now the quality of this steak is great, well flavored but not overly seasoned and can easily be shared by 3-4 people, you definitely pay a lot for it but it's good, what I didn't like is when we finished the tortillas and were offered more we expected that it would be complimentary considering the amount we paid for it but I was disappointed later to see that we were charged for it, now in comparison to the price of the total bill it was small change but it's the principle in my mind, this is a unique place that is very pricey but it's also unlike any Mexican place I've been to before, the drinks are pricey as well, it's a good place to check out but for my budget I couldn't come here too often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aldama-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

""I don't want to have a hundred different tequilas and mezcals on our wall,"" he says. Instead, the bar is focusing on 10 bottles of each, available for sipping from copitas with slices of oranges. A happy hour -- 5 to 7 p.m. daily -- advertises frozen margaritas and beer and mezcal shot combos for $10 or less."".....  There was no mezcal selection, only one cocktail list with 6 drinks ($14 each), one with mezcal....and it was frozen...I'd assume since the founder of the establishment is a bartender, the drinks would be more impressive...to each their own. Food menu was short as well and did not wow me either (and we ordered everything with the exception of the guacamole) There are only 2 meat options on the menu, both are small plates.  One is the cecina; thinly sliced, dried, crispy filet( think beef jerky meets chicharron) and the tacos- very good!  As explained by our server, the corn is imported de Mexico and milled in house!

The cocktails we ordered took a lifetime to arrive, were small, and the beer was flat. The food was the jewel in the awful crown; the burger was a cheap processed burger, in an even cheaper bun, rendering it completely tasteless. Fries were awful.

Lots of deliveries left the kitchen so clearly it's a popular take out place.  There is seating in a small room in the back and a tiny patio for outdoor seating when the weather permits.  I always appreciate a clean decent sized bathroom with a place to hang my coat and handbag.  We ordered the pork belly bun and crispy chicken bun and the pork cutlet noodle special which came with the clear broth on the side.  I like this as I like dry noodles and sipping the broth is refreshing.   Yelp check in treat was a large serving of edamame.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/proong-noodle-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I have yet to try the pitzas, that's next on my list, if I can manage to tear myself away from the falafel that is...If your choice is between Black Iris and Zaytoons around the corner, well I think you know where I stand.

The gentleman started cutting into a piece of chicken when the waitress rushed over with another plate. She told him that she had brought the wrong order and took away the initial plate. Not two minutes later, she brings out our food, with the chicken on a different plate. We asked her if the chicken was the dish that had just been left with the other table and that the other table had touched. She said ""no, that chicken was on a square plate, this one is on a circular plate.""  My boyfriend decided to try a piece, and it was cold. It was obviously the same food on a new plate. We asked to speak to a manager, and he said it was a different plate, then said that the waitress had told him that it hadn't been touched. They were obviously lying and gave us a bit of a hard time about the situation. Eventually they did remake his order (or maybe just reheated even?), and it was good.

There isn't a whole lot of seating, but the five of us got seated right away. Also, good to know that they're cash only right away, and have an ATM right by the front door -- very convenient! We came on a  night where they were particularly slammed, and the very kind waiter informed us of this fact right away. As a result, our food came in strange spurts, but always with a smile and an apology. We brought our own wine, which tided us over in the meantime. We got the zataar bread (to DIE for!), and the five-dip sampler (hummus, tabouleh, beet salad, baba ganoush and pinto beans). Absolutely incredible, and more than enough for the five of us to share. Sadly, they couldn't coordinate our pita bread to come out at the same time, so we used the crusts of our pitzas (also incredibly delicious, especially the Green pitza). However, our waiter kindly comped us an extra plate of baba and hummus when our pita bread did come. We also got kebabs and gyros, which were delicious and very easy to split. After all that, it only came out to 18 bucks a person. We were all completely satisfied, to the point of bursting!

I usually end up getting the five salads platter when I go. The chick peas with spinach is delicious and their baba is great. The pita is made to order and is amazing. I have also tried some other dishes here - the spinach pie is good and HUGE (it's like a full meal by itself and is only $4). When I have gotten entrees, the portions have always been more than I can finish. The first time I went and on one subsequent visit, I got the Pastilla (I don't think this is how it's spelled on the menu - it's a Moroccan dish that is chicken (or pigeon) with almonds in puff pastry topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar). I had only ever had this dish in Morocco. The one at Black Iris was good, though a little too sweet and much more than I could eat. To get the most out of your visit, I recommend going with a group and sharing a bunch of things.

As a fellow Malaysian, I always have low expectation of Malaysian places since they never really hit that spot and make my tummy satisfy with the taste. However, this place really changed my mind. I first got a set B which includes Nasi Lemak with 2 random Malaysian Kuih (Kuih is basically Malaysian cake/dessert, usually bite size). The Nasi Lemak was average, very similar to all other Malaysian places, but once I took a bite of the Kuih, yoooooooo, it blew my mind. I never expect to taste something so authentic in NYC. I've been going back whenever I'm in the area to try out the different kuih, not one have disappointed me yet.

Now it's a Cantonese restaurant. I like the over design of the restaurant . It's wide and airy with brick walls. The price in my opinion is on the pricy side as most of the items are 25+. A chicken broccoli will run you 20 dollars here but maybe it's a bigger portion . A small bowl of century egg congee is 7 dollars. You can get that half the price elsewhere but then again due to inflation and everything else , prices on everything went up . The wonton noodle soup I got was 8 dollars which is fair as you could probably get that for 5-6 else where but definitely not at a good restaurant like this and location like this .

I had the fried garlic chicken, salt and pepper fish, walnut shrimp, and vegetable mushroom yi mein. The garlic chicken was good but I had much better. There was a lot of garlic but the flavor was lacking in the meat. The salt and pepper fish was on the hard side and a tad too salty.

Vincent V.,/user_details?userid=yNpMMJBu3WnWNFYuxpYZaw,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",11/28/2022,4.0,"I was craving for a decent Cantonese meal last week so was looking thru yelp for a list of cantonese grub in Chinatown. Originally me, my brother and mom had decided to dine in on Thanksgiving day, however big mistake follow suit as we didn't prepare at all and we should've reserve a table if anything for any holiday dates. So here is my pleasant experience ordering take out from Uncle Lou. The following day, I stopped by again during their lunch hours and they are again almost having the entire restaurant fully occupied by customers. I was greeted by one of the waitress as I continue to look down at their recent updated menu, I noticed prices were up by roughly 25%, I understand it was the high inflation thus they adjust their prices. I ordered R35 which is the Garlic Crispy Fried Chicken w soy sauce, bokchoy on a bed of rice, and I also ordered Fried Salt and Pepper Jumbo Shrimp over rice. Both were spectacular and delicious! Felt like this is a proper establishment, they take their time and knowledge of cooking and frying these type of dishes. The chicken is crispy, lightly battered, tender and juicy. The shrimp is also lightly battered, fried to light brown colour and crispy. Overall I'm fully satisfied and would like to explore more of their main dishes given the fact that my brother' s birthday is coming up next week, we would definitely reserve a spot so we won't miss out again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/uncle-lou-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Called for 7:30pm reservations for 6 for a Wednesday at around 1:45pm. Lady on the phone said they were busy, call back at around 3:30-4pm. Called back at 4pm to ask for a table. Lady says no need for reservation, just come in. We roll up to the restaurant at 7:30pm just in time to see a guy pulling the gates down. Looked inside and the seats were stacked on tables, place was empty. I asked if they were closed, and the guy said ""sorry, the workers are having ""LNY dinner"". (LNY was back in February.) I'm all for supporting businesses, especially a Cantonese owned spot, but am super disappointed at how we were treated. If I end up actually eating, I'll update this review. But for now the entire exchange left a sour taste in my mouth.

Wei P.,/user_details?userid=DM8DQGjwtFsilS0XdLoFYA,"Queens, NY",10/30/2021,3.0,"Stopped by with some friends for an early bird dinner. The waiters and waitresses were very nice and attentive. And the waiting time was reasonable as there were not as many customers at that time. The amount of their fries and vegetable salad was big enough for 3-4 people to share. My dish was salmon with spinach. I cannot judge if it's authentic or not, cause I am not very familiar with Greek food. To me, it's just OK but not impressive at all. I have also noticed that their menu is not vegetarian-friendly, as there was only one veggie dish (eggplant) available in the entrees.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/medusa-the-greek-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

From the start our hostess was very friendly and accommodating. Let's us move our table outside since it was so nice out and was easier to get a proper seat for the baby joining us. Drinks were solid for a brunch spot everything you'd ordinarily expect and done well. The dip sampler is great for a group good with sharing. A lot larger portion than I had expected so plenty for everyone. Fresh crudite and pita to dip with, we ordered extra cause it was so good. Personal favorites was the spicy feta and was pleasantly surprised by the black truffle Tamara. I normally don't like truffle but this was subtle enough to not overpower the tastebuds. My only complaint is I wish they had just a regular hummus as not everyone is a fan of beets and the flavor can be a bit much. For a main I went with the brunch gyro and loved it. So much flavor, and was able to use some of the remaining spreads to create some delicious unique bites along the way. Sooooo much food though.

When the waitress told me it would take longer for it to cook I didn't expect to be waiting there for 40 minutes. I then ate the chocolate mousse which was okay.

What arrived was a takeout dish of lots of lukewarm potatoes, a small amount of  ground lamb and a few oversized slices of eggplant topped with an entirely loose unset béchamel slopping over the sides.  No spice, sauce or even salt, .   It was easily the worst moussaka I've ever had.  It seemed like they didn't actually have any moussaka when I ordered it and they just threw some ingredients in a tub and hoped for the best.  The Horta tasted a bit rancid as if it had been cooked in oil that was not fresh. I couldn't eat more than a bite of it. The meals redeeming feature was the Greek yogurt topped with cherries which was delicious as always. I don't know what happened to this restaurant, but this was severely disappointing. Desperately need a good Greek restaurant around here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/medusa-the-greek-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My former colleague used to do marketing for them they so even catered to my office back in 2016. I did some silly pics for their IG once. I went to Belgium and saw their pre-opening back in 2018. I attended the opening party of this location and I am only my sharing all of this because their food has been so incredibly CONSISTENT & BEAUTIFUL the entire time. I remember they started Le Pain long ago and an old friend of mine ces worked their too. And while that chain is good, it does not have the small, artistic and sweet vibe of Le Bot. It's a good spot in soho, walkable to whatever else you could dream of. I want to steal their cute plates with their prescription vegetable art on it but I won't.

I absolutely love it! The food is delicious. They are available on food delivery apps but after seeing pics of the place I wanted to go and pick up my lunch in person. Be prepared to wait on a line if you go during lunch hours.  I arrived around 12:20 PM and was on line for approximately 15 minutes before I could order. I absolutely loved the spicy chili sin carne. The bowl includes: brown rice, tri-colored beans, quinoa, chili sin carne, ersatz sour cream, turmeric onion, and fresh herbs. It wasn't necessarily spicy but the flavor profiles were amazing! The ersatz sour cream caught me by surprise with how good it tastes. The turmeric onions had a beautiful bright color and tasted great. I am definitely going to be trying out different things off the menu. The food is on display behind glass panels while the staff prepares your meal. You're able to get a good view of the different options. If you are sitting inside, I did hear that they asked people for confirmation of vaccination status. When you pay at the register you can sign up for their loyalty rewards.

The environment of the restaurant is great, however I did not enjoy the food. The beet balls were stale, the seaweed tartare didn't have a great taste, and the veggie sushi was decent at most.

It was incredibly flavorful, warm, hearty, and exactly what I needed on a cold day. The salad was healthy and delicious as well. There were generous chunks of potatoes and the woman asked me if I wanted fresh herbs on it which I did! I also enjoyed the vegetable noodles and quinoa in it. I'm not sure what the sauce was made out of but it was delicious. She put just enough that it was not overbearing. The absolute best part about it was the tofu because it had some spicy flavor to it that I can't pinpoint. All in all, the flavors went together in such a complimentary way.

Krupa G.,/user_details?userid=WPK3A9y1jk8O994UsntVKg,"New York, NY",12/31/2017,4.0,"Just opened up about 2 months ago in SoHo. Spacious place with ample seating and great decor at every corner. It's an all plant based menu with DIY options along with their recommendations to order form. Ended up going with the sushi, Tibetan mama, and the Moroccan stew. Wouldn't recommend the sushi - was dry and all the components did not seem to go together. The latter two were delicious and the perfect portions to share. They were offering glasses of certain wines on their menu on the house which was an added perk, not sure if they do this all the time.

Rachel S.,/user_details?userid=WlXaim-3kxDFP1cC4stq8w,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/5/2020,1.0,I'll start off by saying the food at la Botaniste is good. Now for the not so good: I came with my service dog and was immediately asked for her certification in which I replied that I'm not required to show it. When I sat down with my food the same woman came up to me and asked me what service my dog provided which is illegal to ask. My dog is trained to sit next to me in her bag but the woman working here told me she needed to be on the floor and that since shes a service dog should be trained to be on the floor. My service dog obviously had no issue sitting on the floor but I was uncomfortable being berated with questions about my disability and my service dog.

They use lots of cheap starches (potatoes, pasta, rice) and tons of processed soy (tofu, TVP, Tofutti brand ""cream cheese."")

I asked for extra dressing on the side since it really enhanced the flavor! Note: They charge $1.09 for extra side of dressing..  but it's worth it.  What i really enjoy about this trendy Soho location is the filtered tap water they keep on all tables, for self-service. The decor is clean, stylish and relaxed. The menu is clear, bright and descriptive, and the light music is played low, complementing the vibe. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They all wear their hair under caps or a net, and they wear white lab coats, giving off a clean, sterile vibe.

Rosh L.,/user_details?userid=vd6YKUkRIUCj1SweBxmi5A,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",7/23/2018,5.0,"Amazing that a pretty vegan, organic and gluten free charmer like this has come to Soho. I appreciate their concept but their portions are far too skimpy given the price point AND the food cost if the items served...I imagine that I'm actually paying more because of the cost of what their rent must be in this great location...sigh! But I will say, their Vegetable Tajine is a DREAM (enhanced tenfold by squeezing fresh lemon on top!, but I must ""plump up"" the small portion (filling only half of the deep bowl!) by adding a side of Quinoa at an additional cost of $1.95...so all-in, this dish ends up costing almost $18. And let's face it, it's not going to break the bank for them to add an extra scoop of either quinoa or brown rice to all of their bowls -- so I hope they will reconsider because no one wants to anticipate enjoying something BIG and then discovering that what's actually presented is quite SMALL! Women, can you relate? Haha! Anyway, this place is great but the servers are asked to dole out skimpy portions and customers will think twice about returning and it will cost them more to lose on repeat business.

As we are about to pay, a woman comes over (unsure if it was his manager or just a coworker) and asks him what he was doing telling him IN FRONT of us that she is not allowed to serve us what we wanted and this is not how the restaurant works. Not only did it make us uncomfortable to be bystanders of this awkward encounter but we felt terribly for the server who was just trying to be good to his customers. She told us he needed to charge us more for a side of Brussels sprouts due to the fact that they aren't allowed to provide customers with something as simple as this (they were also cold and we were charged $19 for Brussels sprouts and a glass of wine).

Lianna T.,/user_details?userid=NtO49z_Rthb4uOdNrZTSew,"Austin, TX",1/12/2023,4.0,"Soaring over the NY skyline, the breathtaking views are well worth a visit. A reservation, as many have noted, also allows you access to The Edge, so we made sure to come early so we could enjoy the view before sunset. Admission to the Edge is $38 per ticket, so a dinner reservation seems well worth it. The entire restaurant and experience has a sophisticated vibe, with the elevator ride up showing a video of the New York skyline from above. Cocktails are tasty and the dessert, The Egg that everyone seems to order is fun. We split a pasta dish that was fine, but the reason to come to The Peak is for the experience and views (not the food).

Isabel T.,/user_details?userid=tpISEMqKLAM29d5CUl-YPA,"Irvine, CA",10/4/2022,5.0,Heard about this spot and didn't get my act together in time to get a dinner reservation but was able to snag a lunch reservation at the bar and it turned out to be one of the best dining experiences of my life. 101 stories into the sky. Although the male bartender was a bit ornery at first my girlfriend and i won him over and he ended up being great as well as the female bartender who also doubled as our server. With a view over Manhattan we had the lunch 3 course meal paired with wines. The food was excellent. I didn't die over the dessert and definitely overindulged so if i were to do it again i would have done the 2 course menu instead. The view on the edge afterwards was breathtaking. Heard it costs $40 to get up there and it was free for those dining in the restaurant. What a bargain. Loved it.

However, everything else about the restaurant was so disappointing. We were a party of 6 and waited almost 40 minutes before we were even served water. We finally ordered cocktails, which also took another 30 minutes to arrive. We ordered our food and continued to wait a very long time. We decided to order only an entree because of the long wait. The server seemed to give off a sense that he was unhappy we were not spending as much as he'd liked. I've never felt so judged while dining at any establishment.

First, I thought it was strange that both tables to my left and right were Chinese, versus the rest of the restaurant. I looked around to observe, and I found that they sat all the Chinese on this side. It was further confirmed when the 4th table, with 3rd including myself, was seated next to the table to my right. The service was fine and attentive. I did not appreciate being racially segregated to one side of the restaurant; it's simply unnecessary and extremely obvious. The view was nonexistent as I happen to come on a day it rained. The food was just okay. Being that my office was only 30 floors down, the view was the same, and this is nothing to write home about. The Edge access was given to those who dine there, and since it was foggy, there was nothing more to see.

This is not another tourist trap location. The food is really delicious although a bit pricey however if you go for lunch prices are a bit cheaper. We started out with that ever popular milk bread which is a in-house made brioche served with a honey butter that is delicious. We also got the steak tartare which is seasoned perfectly and a nice touch to have with the bread. For our entrées we got the lamb pasta and the steelhead trout both were delicious. Really nice rich sauce on the pasta and the trout was so soft and moist it practically melted in our mouth! There was also a delicious roe sauce that was poured on top of the trout when it reached the table and topped it off wonderfully. Service is truly everything here from the servers and their outfits to the people at the front desk downstairs and the elevator service when you ushered up to the hundredth and one floor.

Grace  W.,/user_details?userid=5zTAf4me2yE_i_gXgtFlgQ,"Berkeley, CA",5/15/2022,5.0,It was the best experience. I loved the Seared Tuna (my partner ordered the strip steak but it was a bit overcooked) it was absolutely delicious (chef's kiss) . The dressing was a delicate balance of sour and savory. The views were amazing. The service was also good. I didn't like the wine I ordered after I tasted it and they immediately poured me a wine that was way drier like I requested.

Elle L.,/user_details?userid=tZ-yHtlAiWv26KrfTL3b5A,"Brooklyn, NY",8/19/2022,5.0,"Decided to try Peak during lunch on a random Thursday afternoon. Upon being greeted by the hostess at  level 5, she promptly called upstairs to see if they would be able to accommodate me which they were able to at the bar. Downstairs there is a gorgeous cocktail bar that is dimly lit with cozy chairs. I was then brought to a door that led to an elevator that swiftly whisked me up 102 flights in about 15 seconds (the walls in the elevator change around you as you go up which was a nice touch especially for those who need a distraction from the rise to the upper level). As the elevator doors open, your eyes are treated with a beautiful view in front of you and the restaurant is to the left. Once I made my way in, I was seated at the bar and was positively mesmerized by the view around me. The freedom tower can be seen directly ahead of the bar and the Empire State Building could be clearly seen to my left. Still or sparkling water is free of charge. I ordered a Henriot champagne along with the double wagyu burger that came with their housemade pickles, ketchup and hash in log form (sans fries- honestly these were really good!) I couldn't finish the burger and wound up taking a patty out because it was too much for me.  Capped off my meal with a double espresso. If you spend $40 or more (I know this goes for lunch) you gain access to the edge which is totally worth going to see! Stunning and I mean STUNNING views of the city. This is the perfect place for a romantic dinner or to impress out of towners.

At first we expected the food to be ok at best-- as most touristy restaurants are, we thought we were paying more for the ambiance over the food. But-- to our most perfectly splendid surprise, the food was phenomenal and the service even better! (Pro tip-- ask for a table with a view when you make your reservation!) The squid ink and scallops were absolutely delectable-- cooked to perfection. The milk bread was crunchy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside.

Even though we got a gray cloudy day, the view was still breathtaking. We started with the butternut squash soup, then i got the green circle chicken and my friend got the New York strip steak. I'll start off by saying our entrees took FOREVER, almost an hour- the manager came to apologize and sent us oolong tea drinks since he noticed we weren't drinking alcohol. I'd wait 2 hours if i had to, the food was phenomenal. I have never had chicken so juicy and tender and bursting with flavor- if only the portion was bigger I'd be in food heaven. My friends steak was an even smaller portion, about 4 pieces and the ""brussels sprouts"" was really one brussels sprouts cut in half lol. The steak was tender, juicy and well seasoned. They really leave you wanting to come back for more with portions and flavors like that. We ended with the chocolate tart which was perfectly balanced with a small scoop of ice cream. As a pleasant surprised we were able to check out the Edge, i'm assuming it's included if you dine at Peak.

My wife gave me a treat to this fantastic restaurant which is situated at the 101st floor of ""30 Hudson Yards"", just a floor above ""the Edge"". As we were on our way to the restaurant, we were led to a designated private elevator going to the top (which was cool). We were met at the front desk of the restaurant and was led to a nice table, my wife preferred a table near the glass window and the staff were courteous enough to give my wife's wishes. From the very start, service was already excellent. Table setting was phenomenal, restaurant was very clean, all wait staff were wearing mask. My wife ordered rose tea and I started with Capt. Lawrence beer. We had a monkey bread which tasted amazing (don't ever, ever miss this). My wife and I ordered the same entree, American Wagyu burger, hers was cooked medium well and mine was medium rare, it comes with lettuce and potato terrine. The Wagyu burger ( which was delicious) matched very well with the dijonnaise, tumbleweed cheddar and the smoked bacon. We had a breathtaking view of New York City and the NY skyscrapers during our lunch, plus add to it, they gave us a complimentary pass to ""The Edge"" after eating in this spectacular restaurant. Freddy, the wait staff was terrific, I had my second beer ( Brooklyn lager) in no time. But before I forget, I have to compliment, I had a super-great company (my wife).

When planning my trip, I had originally decided to skip this one and didn't get reservations. As the trip got closer, I started to regret it after checking every single day, multiple times on the days leading up to my trip, I was able to snag a last minute lunch reservation. The ambiance is very classy, yet still casual and comfortable. REQUEST A WINDOW TABLE! Although you can see out the windows from all tables, it is not the same as having a front row seat. Luckily the weather cleared up for a bit while we were there and had stunning views of the city. Our server was very nice and helped us pick a bottle of champagne and suggested some menu items. Hey the starter bread, I'm still dreaming of it! Everything was good though! Eating at the restaurant gets you free access to the viewing deck, which when you factor in the price of admission for that, it makes the food prices very reasonable. I would much rather pay a little extra and have an amazing meal with a view than to just have the view! One of my favorite parts of our trip!

I definitely think all the ratings are catered to the views because this is the type of restaurant that you are paying for the view. The perk of dining here is the view as well as not having to pay to experience the Edge. Other than that, the menu items were very limited (with only around like 6 main entree dishes) which you would assume would be amazing since there aren't that many entrees; however, I would only recommend the appetizers (the only decent food items for the price and the taste). I ordered the lobster which was extremely small and SUPER salty, my friend ordered the chicken which was PINK and she had a terrible stomachache after dining here for the remainder of the night and the day after. The food also took quite a bit of time which was not as expected for such a high class restaurant.

We were immediately greeted with a champagne cart. We opted for cocktails instead but it was a nice touch. The on staff sommeliers were very knowledgeable on pairings. The food was incredible from the bread at the beginning to the cocktails and entrees ( I had the squash blossoms and I'd definitely recommend) . You also get admission to the edge with your dinner. For exclusive time at the edge without the tourists a late night dinner can grant you access after they leave. The views from the tables are spectacular.

Robby D.,/user_details?userid=dKidUW7blmtK7hc0VWFsvA,"New York, NY",4/11/2021,5.0,"I came here last night for my friends birthday and had such an amazing night! First, our server Alfonso was phenomenal. By far one the the best hospitality members I've gotten the pleasure to meet. We started out with a round of drinks where I got the Old Sport. We then moved to apps, where we ordered the milk bread (monkey bread with honey butter), the fois gras, scallops, and a lettuce salad with whipped avocado and pear in it. The crust part of the milk bread was so tasty. If only pizza crust tasted like that. The pin wheel for the fois gras was delish. The other two versions on the plate were also yummy. And then the pickled rhubarb or beet on the side was amaze! The scallop was also great, although next time I will likely replace this with another app due to portion size vs price. The app comes with 2 scallops with a sliver of cauliflower on top. The salad was so refreshing and honestly my favorite of these. For dinner I got the duo of pork while one friends ordered the duck and 2 others ordered the 30 day aged ribeye. All were tasty. My favorite was the duck so I will likely order this next time. The lobster and fluke may win me over when I come back though. The chimichurri sauce for the ribeye was so delish. I wanted to put it on everything! The pork came with a little bit of pork belly which I loved. I'm also a huge fan of black eyed peas so it was a pleasant surprise seeing these layered onto the plate. The Bordeaux we picked to go with dinner paired well with all dishes. For dessert, I got an espresso and the chocolate & caramel. I also got to try their black Forrest donut which wasn't on the menu. They surprised us with the donut for my friends birthday. I loved both and would totally order these again and again. Our waiter also sent us complimentary dessert wines that the chef picked out after our main took longer than expected. We did not bother the wait, nor did we say anything but they still went out of their way to recognize it which we highly appreciated. Lastly right before we left, the manager came out and offered us a private tour of the Indoor portion of the Edge as the outside portion had closed for the night. He brought us into the room and just told us to leave when ready. As the only people back there, we took in the views without any pressure of others being around or feeling pushed to leave. It was truly an incredible night that none of us will ever forget. Thank you Peak & Alfonso for such a memorable time.

Margaret M.,/user_details?userid=iobuTiuhqxGCdoD1C3W45w,"Ridgewood, NJ",6/4/2022,2.0,"So I would like to start out this review by saying that the hostess and our waiter were absolutely fantastic. After that it all goes down hill.  Our waiter suggested that we get the milk bread while we wait for our lunch since everything was made to order. We thought that was a great idea and ordered the milkfrad. We waited, and waited, and waited and finally our food came. Shortly there after the milk braid arrived! Please suggested that they take it back since we already had our lunch but they offered to comp the bread so we kept it. This is where the story gets interesting... My husband ordered a medium rare steak: it was neither. When he cut into it it was steak tartare. I had ordered a well-done burger and when I cut into it it was medium rare. It appears that the restaurant doesn't know how to cook its meat properly. I just same time I happened to look over to a table next to us and a gentleman had left most of his burger and eaten. The middle of the burger was totally raw, which Could suggest why it was not eaten. In any event my husband returned the state and asked for it to be properly cooked, however I ate the burger because I was relatively hungry. When my husband State came back it was now medium well. However he was too hungry to Send it back, and it by this time I had all ready eaten.  Overall I would judge our experience subpar. If you are charging $42 for steak and $35 for a burger you should get it right and cook it to the customers expectations. I would say I would not ever go back to this place, I would just go to the bar and then go to the observation deck",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peak-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I made a reservation for 9 pm weeks in advance, but we were not seated at our table for almost an hour after arriving on time. Because we waited so long, we decided to stick to drinks and dessert. After asking our server for dessert menus, the maitre d came over --seemingly concerned about our satisfaction--only to shame us for not ordering a full meal. He essentially implied that we were taking up a table for another potential party that would make the restaurant more money. This would have been a reasonable response if we did not order anything, but we purchased overpriced cocktails, mediocre appetizers, and underwhelming desserts, only to be treated as if we could not afford more. Any appetite I had disappeared after this blatant disrespect. The only positives to our experience was our server and the panoramic views of the city. Obviously we tipped our server generously as he was excellent and apologetic for the maitre d's behavior. I also should add that the maitre d was initially very attentive, but once he found out we would be spending less money than he would have preferred, he was extremely rude and never returned to our table the remainder of the evening.

Secondly, they helped me hold a flower delivery and kept it a secret till the end of desert menu time.

Lastly, they even helped me make a video to record this most important moment in my life. Through all the process, everyone was trying their best to help me achieve this objective.

It came sliced up, at room temp so not hot or cold, salty, and very fatty. We barely had any steak as most of it was fat. I was very disappointed with the cut of meat we received and for the price, really underwhelmed. Everything else as far as sides, dessert, bread etc was good but to me if the entree does not wow me than the meal is not a success.

Warren T.,/user_details?userid=kyXJPwwgjgeAb5tA9VPo1g,"San Francisco, CA",3/14/2020,5.0,"A recent trip (and our first) to the Peak at Hudson Yards has me writing early.  The trip up to the restaurant/bar space was attended to by four people whose collective demeanor created just the mood we were looking for. The first steps into the space were breathtaking, plain and simple. Seated at the bar I don't remember a ""first-look"" session that created more excitement about the potential future for this deep and brilliantly chosen selection. I could go on for a while on this alone but to be brief, the bar is not going for flash, it is clearly going for depth, nuance and story-telling. Moving into the dining room the motor-driven blinds that were partially closed until sunset slowly opened creating another breath-taking moment. Nothing like it. Period. The dinner was superb from appetizers to dessert and we were collectively wondering if this level of experience was sustainable. The peak was the dessert. A work of art in chocolate mousse with salted caramel sauce, gold foil, raspberry sorbet, dark chocolate crunch, raspberry fruit/purée artwork. We were asked if we would like to move into the space on the other side of the floor (views facing northward) for apéretif/digestif. A single malt Rye and Armagnac capped the evening at a wonderfully slow pace, the view, unparalleled. Unforgettable evening for their second night open. Kudos.

Yes, I know the holy grail of XLB is typically to get the thinnest skin possible, but I don't really care, and these are not too thick. Also, I'm not going to flushing or the Bao on St Marks every time I want a soup dumpling.  The crab and pork are delicious, get them. I wasn't a huge fan of the ""sandwich"" baos (including the duck others seem to like, it was glazed with too much soy/hoisin for me) or the non-soup dumplings. The best chicken dish is the sichuan (but it's not actually, it's American style kung pao/ sesame chicken with a different sauce, which is not very spicy and more sweet).  I'll try some of the other dishes, but it's called Mr Bao, so, like, I guess start with the baos right?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mr-bao-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Whenever I come here I usually get some appetizers and a couple cocktails. I've never tried the mains and probably never will but they look decent enough on paper. The real reason to come here is of course the unique and tasty cocktails. I like that a lot of the cocktails here are inspired off classics, just done in such a unique way that it feels fresh. Sometimes fancy cocktail places put too much emphasis on just picking the most random ingredients they can and doing something wild, whereas a lot of the drinks at Endswell are clearly meant to feel familiar. It certainly makes it easier to pick from the menu. My group tried probably 8 different drinks in total and everything was great!

We got the cold skin noodle (凉皮), meat sauce noodle (炸酱面), and crispy Rougamo (肉夹馍). The Rougamo was my favorite and arguably one of the best I've had in NYC. The pork filling was a perfect blend of lean meat and fat (80% lean, 20% fat). Super flavorful and juicy and not overly oily at all. The pancake was the crispy, flaky kind. I was a bit disappointed that they no longer have hand-ripped noodle (the wide, flat one) but it was still nice and chewy.

We really enjoyed the ambience, and sitting so close to the two-top beside us was not as uncomfortable or distracting as you might think. The soft lighting and the light music vibe was really perfect and exactly what we were hoping for. All of the ingredients tasted very high quality, and the service was all very nice and polite. We enjoyed our experience here very much, and we would return, especially for dessert which we did not have time to order.

Shari H.,/user_details?userid=IUwwK-UuatQeXNNTUK6kyQ,"Brooklyn, NY",11/19/2021,3.0,"3.5 is my official score. I came to Bar Camillo on a Monday at 7 without a reservation but I was still able to get a table for 3 in the covered & heated backyard dining. Not all tables get the same heat (or any). The table in the back left had no heat. A little unpleasant at first. I tried the Ginger Spritz it was nice and refreshing but I'll stick with Aperol spritz. For our meal we had the meatballs (polpette di manzo) , the artichokes (Carciofi), baked cacio & pepe and the seasonal pinsa special - all'Uccelletto which had pork sausage, Tuscan kale, cannellini & sage puree, tomatoes and mozzarella. I didn't love the pinsa special. It was lacking flavor and the after taste was chalky - weird for pizza, I know. I think that was due to the cannellini beans. The cacio e pepe was good not as peppery as I like and I was shocked to see that they used gentile pasta and not spaghetti. I'm also not a fan of artichokes BUT this was actually very tasty. I would try them again but different items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-camillo-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Christopher N.,/user_details?userid=7cra5xzN-a72SAlEiET7iQ,"Brooklyn, NY",8/12/2021,4.0,"Went to Bar Camillo for the first time on a whim for dinner Wednesday night. Had never been before and it's a local spot I had walked by before so I wanted to give it a try. We arrived around 8:00 PM without a reservation and were seated within about 15-20 minutes. I thought it might be quiet on a Wednesday, but while we were waiting someone else asked for a table and we realized 3 other couples were waiting after us! We sat in the back which was cute and romantic. It rained heavily during the meal which actually added to the atmosphere since we were protected by the transparent roof! It was warmer in the backyard than the inside which also looked nice but not uncomfortable as they had fans throughout. My partner and I noticed that it seemed like maybe a server called out; there was one guy literally doing everything from hosting to grabbing drinks to serving food etc. He was a champ! Service was still reasonably paced and I just couldn't believe how good this guy was. Despite doing a million things at once I still felt like he provided personal attention and was easy to get a hold of, like when we wanted the check. Pizza was nice and thin and crispy and filling! Was it the best pizza I've ever had? No, not necessarily. But I liked it overall and enjoyed the service and atmosphere.

The interior is incredibly well done with a soft and upscale yet humble ambiance, fitting for date night, a work dinner, or a casual dinner and drinks with friends. The veal meatballs were amazing in a delicious romesco sauce and topped with parmigiano reggiano. For the main, we both had the Arctic Char- I've never had it cooked so perfectly before. It was melt-in-your-mouth smooth and buttery, while the perfectly seared skin added a light crunch to the flaky char. Served over a bed of greens and beans, we both noted that it felt like we had a farmers market on our plate. For dessert, the creme fraiche ice cream was phenomenal. All in all a superb dining experience and a great addition to our neighborhood. Would recommend to anyone and will definitely be back soon!

In conclusion, minorities receiving poor service  in fine dining is nothing out of the ordinary.  I'm making this post because I cannot stomach going to one more dinner where the minorities in our group are made to feel less then.  When we left Sereneco, that is how we felt.  It was a subject that consumed the rest of the evening and when I heard today that the owner asked our friend to remove his post I just about lost it.  Billy, you get one star and no, I will not be removing this review nor will I be returning.  This is the impression we left with and I will not be silenced on the matter.  For the sake of the chef who prepared such an appetizing meal, do better.  As opposed to offering some defense it's my hope that you can see that customers of yours who came in on a holiday left feeling terrible.  It was not our fault, it was a result of your restaurant's service practice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sereneco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Brad B.,/user_details?userid=MWlWUQBHv7jbxhnay6UCQQ,"Manhattan, NY",2/16/2023,5.0,The space is beautiful upstairs and downstairs with upstairs being a little noisier than downstairs. Our hostess Cayla was amazing and started our evening on the perfect foot forward giving us a beautiful banquette which I recommend to anyone trying to get a table there . The sommelier Kelly was amazing and a lot of fun. Shirley our waitress was also fantastic. The fluke appetizer was delicious but better once we added a little salt and lime . The halibut was tender and a pretty good size portion. I felt the quail was overwhelmed by a sweet and sour sauce. It was tasty but quail is too delicate and should've had a crispy simple application as opposed to being drowned in a sauce. The Cabernet  Tres Leoni by the glass was delicious and fairly reasonable compared to the other wines by the glass. Overall a fantastic evening.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/53-nyc-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
