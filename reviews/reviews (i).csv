Satori Y.,/user_details?userid=JmAggMTqe1LTRNS2CFpPkg,"Eugene, OR",3/10/2023,3.0,"Ambiance was a 10/10. The music and decor was perfect for a girls night out or a date night. Service was a 6/10. Very attentive servers, but come off as trying to rush you and would clean your plate before you were done. Honestly slightly bizarre interactions with severs. Food was a 6.75/10, sushi itself was good and fresh but nothing ground breaking. The serving sizes were small. The wine serving size was outrageous. We ordered 5 glasses of wine instead of the bottle in order to receive more wine per person. Instead we received a bottle to split between 5 people and still charged the individual glass price. Overall a fine experience but nothing phenomenal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momoya-soho-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

On top of that the two ladies in our party of 4 got the lychee cocktail which is a sleeper of a drink if one ever did exist because it tasted like straight juice. Then I got the Suntory beer.

We got a sushi entree, which was a little bit disappointing because the rice fell apart. We also got the sukiyaki gozen, which was ok and the beef was a little bit too fatty. For dessert, we cannot miss their tiktok-famous seasonal parfait. The parfait looked huge and tasted very nice.

Christina M.,/user_details?userid=awvUoM_YS0SRiCctFiefeA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/30/2022,5.0,"Had a great experience for lunch at Momoya SoHo. I made a reservation in advance on resy for a Thursday lunch, during the holidays. The host was very welcoming and my friend and I were seated right away. The restaurant itself is very refined and the decor is great (especially the small touches of holiday decor). For appetizers we ordered the wagyu beef tataki which was very tender and the ponzu sauce was a nice touch. For lunch my friend and I ordered the sushi and sashimi combo which comes with one roll choice ( I got yellowtail and she got spicy salmon) four pieces of sushi and four types of sashimi with two pieces for each type. We also had a choice of soup or salad. The sushi and sashimi was very fresh and of good quality. It's a fine lunch option and for the quality you get I would say it's worth it although there are cheaper sushi lunch options (but you get what you pay for, and for soho this is a good deal). For drinks we got a lychee cocktail and it was sweet and refreshing (could only taste a hint of alcohol which I actually preferred). For dessert we split the seasonal dessert which was the ""Tsuru No Ongaeshi"" -White Wine Gelée, Ginger White Chocolate Ice Cream, Clementine Sorbet, Lemon Verbena Espuma, Apricot Shiratama, Rare Cheesecake, Genmai Crumble, Kinmoku-sei. It was very intricate and there were several layers of flavors to it. At $28 it is definitely on the pricier side but it is an experience and worth while if you are splitting it with at least one other person. I'm curious to try the other seasonal desserts available as the winter parfait was delicious and light. Overall I would definitely come back for lunch!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momoya-soho-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

After ordering several of their most popular dishes, including the seasonal parfait (currently autumn themed), Momoya box, and crispy rice, I feel like everything looks better than it tastes (which is not to say that anything tastes bad, but I do feel like presentation takes precedence here). Visually, everything is stunning, particularly the parfait and the Momoya box. Like, literally made for Instagram. Regarding the parfait, I'm not sure how well the flavors and various components really meshed together. Figuring out how to eat it was a challenge and I'm like 80% sure I did it wrong. Momoya Box had a nice variety of fish; wasn't the best sashimi I've had but it was good. Crispy rice was tasty, just nothing special.

He asked what was they food allergies and what was the mood they was going for because it seem like we all wasn't sure on what to order ""it was many great options"" I did love that for them so i was upset my service was so dry.

Sophia T.,/user_details?userid=4D07BDh2Hb-RzVlJV7v7gA,"Bronx, NY",4/14/2022,5.0,"It was pretty busy on a weeknight at 8:30pm but that didn't stop us from having amazing service from our waitress Kritta (sorry, I have bad memory but her name was longer). She was so sweet and attentive to us and made sure to top our sparkling rose wine and sparkling seltzer as we ate. Once our plates were finished they were cleared out immediately and we didn't have to wait long for our food. The Crispy Rice definitely gets the hype it receives, it was delicious! The Wagyu Tataki was chewy, and fatty. It's something worth trying out, if you like it cold. I was very very happy with the Crispy Duck, it was juicy and tender and bursting with flavor, besides the typical gamey flavor you get from eating duck. I wasn't impressed with the Toro Scallion but it's okay because my date enjoyed it, as with the Chef's Choice sushi! The most anticipated menu item was the infamous Sakura Strawberry Parfait. Kritta was sweet to explain our menu items once she served us and what was on the platter. For dessert she showed us pictures of the dessert menu (of course we got the parfait!). If you like super sweet and fruity flavors, it's so good! The homemade strawberry sauce was amazing and the parfait itself had all kinds of treasure chest pieces like Sakura dango and macaroon and raspberry chocolate shards! We loved our time here, we would definitely come back, especially if Kritta was serving us! She also fixed our wobbly table, lol.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momoya-soho-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Everything is more on the pricier side which is why the food could be better. Fish tastes fresh, portions are very small. However, the service was horrible! We had a middle aged Hispanic lady with pink hair serving the patio Saturday night and she took our order and that was the only time we really saw her. Then there was another middle aged Hispanic man serving other tables on the patio the same night who was killing it and checking on all his tables. He kept walking by and we wish he was our server! When we got our check we waited like 30-45 and the lady never went to get it. The man did instead and we wished we gave him our tip. At the end, she tried to tell us that our Visa gift card couldn't be accepted because there wasn't enough on there for her tip even though we said we would tip in cash! So when she made us pay another way instead, we paid in cash and she awkwardly stood there waiting for us to give her more cash for her tip. We told her to just take the payment for the bill first and we would leave a tip on the table. Weirdest service encounter any of us ever had! We had to ask for a dessert menu and she literally never checked on us.

Eugenia Y.,/user_details?userid=MLbHeXL6S2M1daO3R15SJg,"New York, NY",2/4/2022,4.0,"I was starving, and for some reason, really craving a burger. We looked on Yelp and saw that Kings of Kobe had some really great reviews, and a pretty interesting burger menu. We walked in pretty early for dinner, so we were seated immediately. I didn't really know what to get because everything sounded so good, so we decided we would split our two burgers. We ordered the Duke of Lux and the Louis XIII, both half pound. I liked that we were also asked about how we wanted the burgers cooked. One thing I didn't like is that sides don't come with the burgers, so we ended up ordering sweet potato tots a bit after the burgers came. I thought the tots were okay, but the burgers were so, so good. Juicy, and everything you could really ever want from a burger. Between the Duke of Lux and the Louis XIII, I preferred the Louis XIII (but that's not to say the Duke of Lux wasn't good!). All the ingredients that came together in were amazing--the mushrooms, the truffle oil, everything together was a perfect combination.

Hayden K.,/user_details?userid=3ZGG2SBpbK8gF9rbI_jmgA,"San Pedro, CA",3/29/2022,1.0,"Disaster. I'm usually not someone to complain about the price of a meal. But this place REALLY nickel and dimes you for every little thing. $1.50 for less than an ounce of salad dressing and even more for thousand island. What kind of places charges for the sauce?!!! Everywhere else hands you the bottle!! I was shocked to see that this place had a 4.5 star rating. Their burgers are made with Wagyu beef but let me tell you something, there is good wagyu and bad wagyu... this place clearly had the bad kind. The food did not agree with me at all and the burger did not taste good. It wasn't that it tasted bad, it was that is was TASTELESS, which is actually very hard to accomplish when you have bacon and cheese on the burger. Perhaps they were stingy with their sauces (wouldn't surprise me). The fries came out room temperature and stiff and had no flavor in them. Crazy to think a place with such low quality and quantity ingredients could squeeze out every little penny. There are way better options in NYC if you want a burger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kings-of-kobe-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Our server Rocco was super nice and really made it a great experience. We had a lot of fun, as it was my fiancé's birthday. We had a Tito's and soda, and then tried the ""Summer loving had me"" cocktail and it was delicious. Vodka, muddled strawberries, pear liquor, Campari and cranberry juice. I highly recommend trying the waffle dog for a starter. It's basically a corn dog, but instead of cornmeal, it's waffle batter. It comes with a spicy maple flavored mayo dipping sauce that is such a good complement to the waffle and the hotdog. I ordered the chili project dog (wagyu beef chili, diced red onions, and shredded cheese). It's fantastic, but I also tried the frydom fighter dog as well, (bacon wrapped and fried hot dog, crispy onions, royal fry sauce), and it was sooooo good!  The red onion rings were perfectly cooked and delicious.

The fun atmosphere inside although the music was a little loud. Despite the name, the burgers are made with American Wagyu beef.  I ordered the Kings Standard burger (marinated roasted tomatoes, white cheddar, pickles, cherry pepper mayo). My wife ordered the Go Fish sandwich (Alaskan salmon burger, lettuce, red onions, avocado, tomatoes, pickled ginger, citrus mayo) and we shared an order of battered fries with dipping sauce.  The burger was excellent- perfectly juicy and delicious, although the toppings sometimes overwhelmed the flavor of the Wagyu beef (I'd probably go with the build-your-own option next time with fewer toppings).  My wife enjoyed her fish sandwich as well, although the pickled ginger was aggressive.   The fries were very good as well.  The bar offered a small selection of draft beers but a more extensive menu of cocktails.  The service was friendly and attentive.  I would definitely recommend and return here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kings-of-kobe-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

(All happy because the Giants finally won their first home game).  The food was mediocre at best as my order of a burger was done well instead of medium rare. The ""Not Good"" review is based on the service which was sub-par at most. Part way through, I decided, I wanted pickles with my dry burger. I've ask the bus boy since the waitress was working 5 tables and he said he would put it in the system and inform the waitress. As I waited a few minutes and yet to receive anything, I asked the waitress and she said that she wasn't aware and started to berate me in front of my friends stating that ""she is a server and put the order through her and not ask the bus boy. I am your waitress and that why it was never put in. and I should have known to ask her and not the bus boy."" The rudeness was uncalled and felt unjust.

Ginger R.,/user_details?userid=80HAsfN8WN-fovApr5esJQ,"St Cloud, FL",6/18/2021,1.0,"If I could give this place a 0 star review I would. First of all let's start out with the fact that this location was completely empty and 5pm and on a Thursday that should be an indication of the quality of food here. Second of all the prices are absolutely inflated for the quality of food that you get here. Don't be fooled by the reviews as I'm told by my neighbors that they have on good authority that the majority are actually fake, purchased reviews. Lastly and most importantly was the ""manager"" Etsi's attitude which you can clearly see reflected in his other responses to reviews, he feels that you are ""lucky"" to be able to eat at ""his"" establishment. I was with a party of seven people and as a result of some of the reviews that I saw decided to finally try this location after going on the circle line. One of our party was an eight-year-old boy, this young man does not like to eat cheeseburgers as crazy as it sounds. As a result we went across the street and purchased him a slice of pizza. Well at this point the rest of the party was in the process of placing an order when the manager comes out and says ""you can't eat that pizza here"" in a very condescending tone. My wife explained that my son doesn't care for hamburgers and respectfully asked if we could stay. At that point he says ""I don't care you can't eat that here."" I try to appeal to the manager Etai stating  that the two elderly people that we were with were hungry and we'd rather not go to another location and if he would make an exception. He did not. He stated ""no please leave go sit in the park and eat the pizza then come back"" I don't think that any one wants to be subjected to that type of behavior from a manager, he basically lost out on an approximately $300 check because he didn't want a child to eat a slice of pizza. Hopefully there Is someone with authority at this restaurant that will speak with this manager and help him to understand that sometimes you have to be flexible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kings-of-kobe-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I came here with my family after a long day at the museum and boy did the burger not disappoint! I ordered the Duke of Lux burger medium. First, I was surprised at the size of the burger. Second, when I cut the burger in half to eat (since it is huge) it was prepared just right. It was mouthwatering and it melted it your mouth. I didn't order fries with it and I'm glad I didn't because it would have went to waste due to the burger being so filling! I am definitely coming back here. Our waiter was also very friendly. Parties were social distanced as well. The also have a few apparitions within tables. We are deciding on a day next month now to go back!

The servers are over attentive, making us feel a little rushed. The food was all pretty good, not great.  We tried the mac and cheese balls which were a little bland. We also tried the pastrami sliders. They were good but the pastrami was a little thin. We also had the chili project hotdog. It had too much chili making it difficult to taste anything other than the chili, which wasn't the best chili in the world. And at $11 or $12 it was certainly overpriced. We also got one of the burgers, I forget the name. Maybe king of luxe or something.  It had bacon, gouda, caramelized onions and chipotle mayo. Pretty good burger--cooked as we specified. They would not let us swap the gouda for cheddar which is a little outrageous for a $20+ dollar burger (without fries).  The caramelized onion taste was too strong and overpowered the rest of the ingredients. Milkshakes were top notch.

However, if you are in the mood, you can certainly get the hot dog (and I suppose since the location is Hell's Kitchen, the prices would be higher due to rent as well).

I ordered the sweet potato tots and King's Standard with bacon and honestly can't say I enjoyed any of it except the pickles on the burger. The tots were fine but not great, and while the pickles were awesome, that's not really saying much about a burger joint. Of all the places to grab food from in Hell's Kitchen, I would not recommend making a trip out here, unfortunately. The bun was toasted in an awkward way so that the corners got hard while the center was still squishy, and the sheer flavor of the burger meat so off that after a few bites I had to come to terms with the fact that this meal wasn't going to get any better. Perhaps the hotdogs are better, but I don't think I'll be giving Kings of Kobe another try to make that judgement call.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kings-of-kobe-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The fries are the only issue which is why I would say a 4.5 - the burger was so good but the fries were lacking. Very crispy but not salted at all.

Vit F.,/user_details?userid=StCepcRzPr-lk36dkA9Ohg,"New York, NY",12/9/2018,3.0,"Burgers are good and french fries are good. However, it really pissed me off that they ask you to tip with the boxes options (20-25-30%) even before you get the service, and when I have to go to the register to order. Those tip boxes options are a rip off and really pissed me off. Also, they offer drinks and sauces in plastic containers, plastic straw and all that crap. Common really? haven't you guys catch up on the news? We are screwing up this world with the plastic residues !

That is totally childish, unless ur burgers are pre-made with the sauce already on them. Either way, TOTALLY LAME. She tells me this one sounds really good except for the bbq sauce. what other sauces do they have? I reassured her, i'm sure they can take off the sauce. Extra charge for different sauce? I chuckled at first, i said come on just switch the sauce lol come on thats ridiculous. they said NO with no remorse. If i want the different sauce they can give me a tiny cup of sauce for extra money!

Tony M.,/user_details?userid=ar2VcQd35dh4-hUSUrQv2A,"Mendham, NJ",12/9/2022,3.0,"So disappointed. My go to menu item was the burger. They changed and ruined it. Rather than coming with bacon and egg, it's all a la carte. The problem is when you order the bacon, they literally bring you a side of bacon instead of adding thin strips of bacon to the burger. On top of that, the bacon was all fat and the fries did not come with the truffle aioli. Since it's all a la carte, what used to be $28 cost me over $40. The menu stated the price of the bacon was $5, but when the bill came, we got charged $12!!! If the burger had been good or better than the original,  I wouldn't have minded the price increase given inflation. My mom's risotto came out cold. If we hadn't purchased another scotch bottle tonight, we probably wouldn't return. To top it all off, we found out that the great and lovely manager Dasha left the place. It is no wonder this was such a different experience from the past. At this point, it is clear they are catering to clueless tourists rather than regulars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

For cocktails we went with an old fashioned made with an Elijah Craig Bourbon and the Oaxacan from the menu. The presentation on the Oaxacan was creative and helped keep it at the proper temperature. No spoiler - you'll have to go to see it! We split the cocktail shrimp - always a good test - and passed easily. The scallops were excellent although the corn spoon bread could have been warmer. Chicken with mashed and Brussell sprouts had a delicious crust. Coffee gelato was a nice finish and paired well with another old fashioned. Service was attentive, too! We'd have felt good about the value in NYC - but the live music totally put this place over the top. On Sunday night it was an excellent trio playing 1920s traditional jazz that evoked Coney Island.

However, the taste of almost every dish we had was extremely underwhelming. The trout was cooked beautifully. The skin was crispy, but it needed salt badly. Portions were small, too. Did not enjoy the food overall. It could just be because it was restaurant week, but you figure restaurant week is when restaurants would put forward their best to attract new customers.

Farah G.,/user_details?userid=7KmDkQr1-HN6Ua-olZKWwA,"Centereach, NY",8/25/2021,5.0,"As someone who doesn't always take the time out to leave reviews when I have a good experience, I had to leave a rave review for this restaurant because my experience last night was UNBELIEVABLE. My waitress' name  was Young and if I could leave a review for her alone, I would give her 10 stars! From start to finish, this restaurant exceeded my expectations. I went for a special birthday dinner and the ambiance was incredible. The live music was excellent (not too loud and we were sitting right in front of the stage), and the food/drinks were absolutely divine. We started with the combo meat/cheese/paté board and octopus, then had the NY strip and the Chilean sea bass as entrees (the Chilean sea bass with cauliflower purée was OUTSTANDING, I swear I dreamt about it in my sleep), and because it was my boyfriend's birthday, they sent over a very cute complimentary chocolate cupcake with a candle, and we ordered the Sphere for dessert which was gorgeous and worth every penny. Their whiskey selection is out of this world (so many to choose from, almost overwhelmingly so) so we chose to do a whiskey flight. Young was so informative and really took the time out to explain each and every whiskey to us. She even gave him a little whiskey on the house while we were waiting for dinner just as a birthday gesture. I ordered two cocktails beforehand which were both also great. We never felt unattended because they checked on us frequently, and I can't stress enough, this was probably the best dining experience I've ever had BAR NONE. If you're thinking about going to this restaurant and bringing someone special, RUN don't walk. I'll certainly be back in the future!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The place had a Great Gatsby feel to it. Throughout the Interior  we noticed that there were alcohol displayed all around & were labeled under names for regulars & their drink of choice. Might sound corny but I thought it was interesting ;) too bad I can't upload my video of the jazz band that was playing! The guitar player was amazing to watch and listen to, especially the solo he had!!! Only thing that was a little disappointing was that the salmon lacked flavor. I asked for the skin to be crispy & unfortunately my plate did not come really hot (right off the pan) however we all still enjoyed our time & experience!

Food portions are incredible along with the taste so definitely worth every penny you spend. I hosted my fiancé's birthday party here but the reservation alone required a pre-order of food and a deposit which can be very frustrating to deal with if guests don't show up so you lose money. However, the service is just so exceptional and the management/chef are there to give you the best time you can have. Even going back and forth via email with the manager/director was prompt and easy. They do need to accommodate guests of larger than 6/7 parties with the ability to pay individually for what they order, that would've saved me a lot of trouble and money. The 28-layer cake was custom made for my fiancé and was hands down the best cake I've ever had. I truly want to thank the chef for such an art piece. Every guest who tried the cake literally wanted to take a slice home with them. My only problem with the place is the ridiculously loud music that makes it impossible to have a normal conversation.

Well firstly a steak that is not drenched in sauce. The description of the Tamahauk steak states it comes with a chimichurri sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't doing the meat justice. The steak came drenched in some sort of sauce that overpowered the flavour of the meat. The said chimichurri sauce came on the side together with blue cheese sauce. When I ordered the same steak in other steak houses it was always seasoned and dry to showcase the meat. Also, a small order of asparagus that costs $14 seems odd since it wasn't anyhting special. Everything else was top notch. The scallops, the octopus, and crab cocktail. Will I be back? Yes, but not for the steak. I think most steak enthusiasts will agree that proper steak is served to showcase the meat, and if the meat is good then only salt and pepper are needed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The atmosphere with the live music on a Saturday night in the middle of Covid was amazing... made you forget there is a pandemic going on. It was on the louder side so having a conversation with all 4 of us was difficult but it was nice to have live music. The reason I only give this place 3 stars is because the food was not very good. I went with 4 people and all of us were disappointed in our dishes. The steak I got had good seasoning but it was very tough. When I spend $40 plus on a steak I don't want to have to chew each bite 15 times or have to saw through it with the knife. My girlfriend has an allergy and we asked for the carrots to be served on a separate plate they put them on the same plate as the steak.

Patrice C.,/user_details?userid=CgOWFQYnmLkIDPqji0w0Xw,"Manhattan, NY",5/5/2018,3.0,I took a friend here for her birthday. I'd been before with a large group and quite liked the drinks. The live music is great and the songstress belted our some heartfelt tunes. My back was to the stage but my friend enjoyed it. We opted not to drink and just had dinner. I got the bolognese and she tried the fish (I think it was bass?). She liked it but didn't love it. I didn't try it as it was sitting on a bed of veggies which included bloody onions. My dish was fine. The pasta was a good consistency but the sauce left a lot to be desired. I actually put hot sauce in it to give it some flavour and that is blasphemy. Sigh. I really wanted to like it. We then had the creme brûlée which was the winner of the night. There were flecks of vanilla bean which leant it some complexity and bits of fruit on top. All in all I'd rate the dessert a 6/10 and the food 3.5/10 so average-ish. One nice touch is I mentioned to the waiter when I ordered the creme brûlée that it was my friends birthday and he brought out extra desert offerings with a candle. We really appreciated it (too bad the taste wasn't there). The two dishes and one dessert came out to 100 after tip. So meh.

Ali V.,/user_details?userid=FoeaygeTK_TLc_YT9oWcaQ,"New York, NY",2/15/2018,4.0,"This place was very full at 7:30pm on a Saturday. There would have been no room if we wanted a table for dinner without a reservation. We got seats at the bar, which gave us a nice view of the stage. There were two different jazz bands that came on that evening. Besides my friend and me, there was an older couple who seemed like regulars sitting at the bar, a young man having a drink alone, and a group of friends standing around and chatting. The tables seemed to be mostly filled with couples. The music was nice, and was quiet enough that people could still have conversations. They had a great selection of whiskeys, and the bartender had a lot of information about each of them. It looked like someone would climb up on a ladder when people ordered less-common drinks that weren't kept in the main bar area. I was served my 1792 Sweet Wheat Bourbon from the flask, and given a glass with water, a glass with ice, and an eyedropper to add water more carefully.

My group wasn't feeling very adventurous with the drinks, so we didn't end up trying any of the cocktails, and mainly ordered separate dishes for ourselves. It does take a SUPER long time for the food to come out, so I'd recommend getting cocktails to help pass the time, or come with the expectation that you'll be waiting at least 30-45 minutes for your food to come out.

We weren't there long enough for the 2nd band's intermission; otherwise, we would've had to move at least 3-4 more times factoring in the intermission and the end of the 2nd set.  To add insult to injury, two of us were pushed back into the alcove such that we could not see the stage or performers at all.  Putting a table, chairs and diners right in front of the steps while the stage is in use is clearly a NYC Fire Code violation and ruined what was supposed to be a nice night with friends who hadn't seen each other in a few years.  For the amount of money we spent, we could've had a much more enjoyable, uninterrupted time at any of the other upscale restaurants in the city.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fine-and-rare-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The cocktails here are quite good. They don't come cheap but cocktails are made very well. We had the Ginger Brenner House, Highlander, a flight of Scotch Explorer, and the Smokey Old Fashioned. As for food, I would skip it. The pork chop we ordered was on the tough side but acceptable. However the sides, truffle fries and French lentils were subpar. We told the staff about the non truffle tasting truffle fries and they took it back to the kitchen. When they brought it back, I thought there would be some hint of truffle taste. There was NONE. So we didn't eat any fries. Onto the French lentils. One word. BLAND. We asked for the manager and brought this up with her. She apologized and made things right.  I would prob stick with cocktails and music but nevertheless service was great and they did what they had to in order to smooth things over. I would def come back for the music and the cocktails. The two different groups playing were quite good. The first group was better but the second wasn't bad either. The cocktails were done right. Our Scotch flight was presented well. They brought six glasses and then a caddy with all the Scotch to be poured. The guy pouring was pretty knowledgeable and we had a good flight!

When the band took breaks, the ambience music was a little too loud and a completely different genre which threw off the vibe. The food was excellent, scallops and salmon. The service was very attentive, but felt overly rushed. The main dish was served right when the appetizer plates were picked up. We wanted to enjoy the music but felt very rushed by all the staff.

Since the moment we walked in we were warmly greeted by the host Letty. The manager Masha personally walked us to our table and made sure we were comfortable and had a clear view of the stage. She constantly came over to make sure we had our food and drinks and that we were happy with our service she is a lovely person and very funny and sweet. She really cares about her job and most importantly the customers. Our server Greg came over to take our orders and when we couldn't decide on drinks or our meal he was very helpful and knowledgeable such a great guy and very funny aswell!

Marisa T.,/user_details?userid=VYzH_BUqf0RLZ1gUzeeBmg,"New York, NY",1/27/2018,2.0,"2.5 stars. Food was sub par. For appetizers my boyfriend had the tomato salad which had waaay too much balsamic vinegar and I had the arugula salad which was ok. For our main course he had the paella which he said was ok, not great, and I had the Greek grain bowl which was 80% quinoa and had hardly any beans. They also ran out of tofu when I was there. So basically we paid $20 for a huge bowl of quinoa. The ambience is very weird. When the jazz band wasn't playing, they had songs that sounded like techno/electronic music blasting. Totally confusing.

I also got the kir royal french cocktail to drink. I really enjoyed everything but I actually wasn't too crazy about the duck crostini. The duck crostini was more of an aged duck on top of the bread with a good dallop of honey. The baked camembert with mushroom and truffle oil was soo good. Melty cheese with a good amount of mushroom and the delectable taste of truffle. The steak was also really good and the mashed potatoes that came along with it were soft and yummy!

We assumed he was just joking. After a few seconds he yelled repeatedly, ""we don't like masks here!"" After being in shock at the moment, my wife asked ""you like Trump?""

However last time I went there with my friend - 2 weeks ago..I had the worst experience with the bartender. My friend and I enjoyed our first round of drinks and asked for a second, the bartender (I forget his name now, but he had dreadlocks) makes my friend their drink. 10 min later I ask for my drink, he gets angry and throws out my friends drink because I couldn't tell he was busy. I shouldn't have to wait an additional 10 minutes after my friends drink was made to have my drink and by no way should a bartender take your drink and throw it out. Even if they are having a bad day this is unacceptable.

Lena could just as easily be nestled amidst similar cobblestoned Parisian streets and you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference.

Glasses of 2015 Bordeaux came and went, as did the warm glazed rosemary roasted Brie and a light-as-air creme brûlée.

The wine has been good both times, as was the food. The first time my boyfriend and I got a ""choose four"" charcuterie board- we chose brie, a sheep's milk cheese, chorizo and duck. The board was also served with nuts, honey and fruit. The second time we did grilled brie (I think) which came served over toasted bread.

There seemed to only be two people working the whole restaurant doubling as host and waiters, and it just was too much. I had a reservation and they almost didn't seat us, saying they were full, but they finally gave us a table. We then put in an appetizer and drinks, which was fine. When we ordered our main courses, we sat waiting for almost 2 hours. We tried to flag down a waiter to ask to check on our food, but it took them far too long to check on us. When they did, they told us they forgot to put our food in. They gave us one free round of drinks, but I really think we should've gotten a discount or anything because we were there for so long and hungry. They also had bread baskets but didn't bring it to us until they brought our food. The food was really good though, but just make sure they have more than two people working the restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/l%C4%93na-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We got the 4 item cheese/charcuterie board,( with French Brie, truffle tremor, Serrano ham and chorizo), the Savoyard flambée, escargot appetizer, and chocolate cake for dessert. The board was a huge portion size, with generous amount of meats and cheese. The Brie paired with the honey was a match made in heaven! The Savoyard flambée was also delicious. The cheese melted in your mouth but the flat bread maintained its crispy crunch. The escargot came out piping hot and delicious. Surprisingly, it had a more parsley/lemony taste that was amazingly fresh and savory. Lastly, the chocolate cake was rich and decadent (but not too sweet) and was the perfect end to our meal. Also did I mention the happy hour?? From 4-7pm they offer $8 Malbecs. Overall amazing vibe,  food and drinks and service!!

The food was quite good. I had the meatballs with a side of Brussels sprouts, my friend had the duck confit, my husband had the pork, and all of it was tasty. My husband also ordered escargot as an appetizer and had trouble getting one of the snails out of the shell - so they brought him another whole round on top of what he ate.

I love the ambience and location is great, however I don't think I've ever waited so long for a meal in my lifeIt's a new restaurant so I am sure they're working out some kinks but the service was wildly slow. There was about 3,000 servers working but no one was really working? We were in no rush and I'm not an impatient person but after waiting an hour for our first appetizer I was a little bit like y'all good back there? Food was okay. I ordered the fish which had a nice flavor but it was just a quarter sized slab of fish swimming in broth. I asked for some rice on the side to eat with it bc ur girl needs substance, but after 40 minutes of waiting I canceled it and ate my lil fish in ab three bites. Is this how the Williamsburg girls stay so fit? I also got the salad that had savory granola on top which was v weird and soggy. Anyway! I have no idea what I'm talking ab and I never write reviews but thought I'd share. I would come again bc I love the interior designers & drinks are good but I wouldn't come hungry lol‍",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cool-world-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The inside is small so definitely make a reservation if you can. I got the purple sweet potato latte, the whipped mascarpone banana bread, and the seasonal scramble. I would probably skip the latte, it was lukewarm and tasted pretty artificial. The ribboned eggs on the seasonal scramble were done well, but the toast itself may have been toasted too long...it was nearly burnt! The star of the show was the banana bread! The coffee flavored mascarpone paired deliciously with the sweetness of the banana bread.

We ordered a couple dishes for the table and I liked them all except for the char siu baby back ribs. I LOVE cha siu baos, and have at least a couple stored in my freezer at all times, so I was really excited about the ribs. I felt like they just got the sauce flavoring wrong. To me the ribs were sickly sweet and tasted heavily of hoisin sauce. I wouldn't get those again, but very much enjoyed everything else. The dumplings (shrimp) were tasty, the bok choy was awesome and i loved the flavor. The bacon and shrimp fried rice was my favorite dish of the night. It was kind of unique and just really delicious.

We were all confused as my friends still wanted that dish. I'm vegetarian/vegan and had the fried spinach dumplings. They were ok but would have preferred them without cheese. I did like the shishito peppers because they were vegan (I think) and the portion was generous. I ordered the hoisin noodles as it was pretty much the only entree available. It's called hoisin Hakka. To the restaurant, hoisin means seafood in Chinese so perhaps an update to the name would make it more clear. The noodles were disappointing. Very hard and I didn't finish them. Despite giving us a two hour dining limit our server was hard to pin down the rest of the evening. It took almost 30 mins to get our dessert and another 20 mins to process our cards. We asked for individual cards if possible and the server said it would take a longer ""minute"". Had we know it would take 20 we would have done one card.

Nina C.,/user_details?userid=HedBvb844sLMyJP7H_B57Q,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2/5/2022,1.0,"Came in here on a Friday night with some friends for drinks. While we were in the lounge, my friend asked me for my e-cigarette and took one small hit. Fifteen minutes later, the bouncer came up to me and told me that I was vaping when I said I hadn't after that one time and ensured him we didn't or wouldn't after that. He proceeded to grab my arms and shove me out of there, yelling at to me GET OUT. All my friends were in complete shock as I told him multiple times to get his hands of me and refused to listen, just continually yelling. He continued to shove me until we were all out and looked like a psychopath. I understand I was in the wrong but for him to not even listen to a word I was saying and rudely grab onto me to get me out is just sickening. Would not recommend this place for a night out, you're better off going anywhere else.

Now dont know what happened! The menu shrunk to one page lost so many good food options and the Bar Manager refuses to make certain drinks at the fully stocked bar. Why? Because we just dont! I havent had a drink in 3 weeks and was talking Macao up to a friend and was looking forward to having a well crafted cocktail here but apparently they ""just dont"" make what I want. No explanation, no reason they just wont. The place was completely empty and its just me and a friend and they refuse to make me one Long Island. They also refuse to make Lychee Martinis. Didnt know since the name is Macao they adopted communist rules as well and decide what you can and cannot drink. Youd think during a pandemic thats forcing all the restaurants in NYC to close up permanently and the fact I was sober and just wanted one drink theyd want to make some money and make me a happy customer. But nope! Bad Management! I have been coming here for 6 years and will no longer return or recommend anyone ever again! Sad!

I met up with a few friends for cocktails and was instantly impressed. A sweet tea vodka fan for life, I always judge a bar if they have that offering. Interesting they did not offer sweat tea vodka but rather had Green Tea Vodka. Always willing to give something new a try, I ordered one of the specials and it was delicious. Our stomachs were driving our ordering decisions. We tried several small plates and of note, the fried rice is what I best remember. Oh, and the doughnuts at the end were a very good choice. The food and the drinks were the highlights. The downside is the music was quite loud and it made it difficult to hear my  friends at time.

The drinks are really delicious and special. My favorite is the drunken dragon milk - green tea vodka with puréed young coconut and lime - amazing flavor. Although it's a heavier, sweeter drink than I normally go for - I may already be developing an obsession with this cocktail. The mushroom truffle croquettes are incredible with just the right balance of flavors. The scallop and chive dumplings also achieve a great flavor. The burrata and sautéed kale were good picks too. The interior is very soothing and dark, it has a nice way about it. The staff is attentive and helpful.

Such a chill vibe - you really feel like you've stepped into an old Macao outpost from last century. The food is both unique and delicious, a great fusion of Asian influences with a hint of global Portuguese. I grazed off of the appetizers and put together a meal out of the small plates - the chicken and pork belly dumplings, mushroom & truffle croquettes, char sui bbq ribs, etc. They have a fun selection of drinks, too, with a section on the menu devoted to ""fancy cocktails.""

The server found us outside after we had already left the restaurant to inform us of the mistake. She could have kept the extra cash for herself but chose to be honest and that really went a long way with our party as they ended up tipping her even more. So many great many items here!

Went there in a Monday night and it happened to be live music night which was a pleasant surprise. Tasteful soft jazz welcomed us to the beautiful decor and cozy setting. I was there with 2 other guests and we all enjoyed our cocktails (sorry I can't remember the names). We had steamed shrimp dumplings to start which left us yearning for more. Definitely the highlight of our meal. Second highlight was the crispy fish. Flavorful and juicy just like it should be. The server kindly  offered to fillet us it for us, but I happened to be there with a chef thus we kindly declined. The fried rice was unfortunately pretty salty.

I'd come downtown just for that dish. I'd eat it every day if I could. It had an entire tail of lobster sitting on top that was grilled and seemingly, the rest of the lobster was in the noodles. Lots of chunks of perfectly cooked lobster through out. The sauce was super spicy and creamy. Cannot say enough about those noodles!

I had 2 Negronis and I was very disappointed. Even when I gave the bartender direction to use less ice and actually measure out the alcohol (they don't measure, and maybe that's where the problem is) he rolled his eyes and made me the same drink thinking I wasn't watching. Super disappointing service.

The ambiance is awesome, it's straight out of a movie, awesome old school Asian/Portuguese influence; the food is delicious, service is really good, and the drinks are to die for. There's an upstairs bar which is almost always packed and a small restaurant area. If you go on a Thursday-Saturday evening, they will also have the downstairs open. I love the downstairs, it's dark, lit with a bunch of candles, there are a few small tables and small bar and the bartenders are awesome. My favorite food items: mushroom & truffle croquettes, BBQ pork ribs and shrimp mozambique. All I amazing. I ADORE their Drunken Dragon's Milk drink, and their bashful maiden was really good too  If you tell the bartenders what type of liquor you like and the flavor you are looking for, they will throw something together and it will likely be AMAZING. My only minor complaint is, as one would expect, it's not cheap, but a super cool place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Very nice ambiance(Typically dark lighting). The bacon and Shrimp fried rice is sooo damn good you just want to slap someone( but don't!)! The Macanese Noodle dish is soooo upsettingly good it makes you want to do back flips!!( upsetting because you'll eat it too fast and then it's gone). The first 2 times I was there I had the dish was made with lobster( as described on the menu here). However I was just there yesterday and they had it with jumbo prawns and I actually preferred it with the prawns. Either it's made its totally worth the price. It is a bit spicy but I spice doesn't bother me.  Either way, the service is great, the food is awesome.

Christina G.,/user_details?userid=sNn49OwMPUBhMfozyGz2zw,"New York, NY",1/13/2016,4.0,"I visited Macao for the first time last week and have to say it was one of the best meals I have had recently. The interior of the space is dimly lit and stunning. Apparently it is fashioned to look like the brothels and opium dens of 1930's Macao. That definitely comes through, especially when you take a look at the artwork and scandalous figurines that pepper the stairwell to the downstairs speakeasy. Around 7pm on a Friday night there were plenty of seats available, but after 8pm the place really seemed to pick up. The drink list is great and we really enjoyed our cocktails. The favorite at our table was the Bashful Maiden.  Both the food and drink selection seems to be Asian inspired with an exotic twist. We split a number of appetizers and sides including the charred octopus, which was the best I have ever had. It had great texture and wasn't rubbery the way I have had it at some places. Our favorite thing by far were the mushroom and truffle croquettes. It was very difficult not to order more, they are a must!  Service was attentive and we were happy that they accommodated our walk in, despite there being a lot of reservations coming in. I will definitely visit again and would love to come back to the speakeasy for a sexy date night.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Even though most tables were full the hostess graciously gave us a booth at our request. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a smoky dark old world bar in Hong Kong back in the 50s,60s. It is romantic and funky with interesting drinks. I had the Mata Hari a cognac based drink and my Husband had the Bashful Maiden a gin drink. We started with the chicken and pork belly dumplings and the spareribs. Both were delicious and flavorful. We ordered our 2nd round of drinks when Franny our wonderful server informed us that we would have to wait since a health inspector made a surprise visit. They have an A rating which they still have after inspection. They are not allowed to mix cocktails or cook until inspection was completed. We were happy to wait since we were in no rush and it was Valentines Day. After inspection was completed our African Chicken and Veggie Fried rice came out. We split both and the chicken was moist and juicy and I could've eaten the fried rice all day. We ordered the banana split which Franny informed us was on the house cause of the inconvenience!

Before I went, i did my research and looked at the menu online. It wasn't too attractive since I'm chinese and everything on there was just regular chinese food (bokchoy, shrimp, fish etc). Once I got there, it all changed. The setting had an old fashion chinese restaurant feel to it. The food was great also. Loved the sirloin and the Drunken Dragon Milk was great. Since I'm not much of a liquor fan, this drink was satisfying. I totally recommend people to try this restaurant. I might or might not go there again though.

We were seated at the bar in the basement- The room at first seemed more like a private room/lounge. But as the crowd picked up, it had alot of potential to hang out and meet others. Most of the patrons were mid 20-30s professionals and seemed a somewhat fashionable. The menu was interesting and I don't necessarily mean that in a skeptic manner. Basically, you can choose a dish and have it either Asian or Portuguese style. The dishes were good but not amazing. Based on my tastes, some of them seemed over-seasoned. I'm supposing this is due to their well made cocktails and the intention to drink more and snack lightly. Thus, I'd recommend this place more for drinks and crowd (if you are looking to start off your Friday in style).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/macao-trading-company-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The ambiance was dim and moody, pretty nice. Servers were very nice overall. I'm knocking off a star for the slow pace and lack of attention in service. It bothers me when a restaurant is only a quarter full but there are five servers clustered in a corner talking with each other and studiously avoiding eye contact with the customers.

As you walk in past the metal doors and observe the dim lighting, dark brick walls, wooden ladders, and the balcony littered with random objects, you will feel like you're dining in a warehouse from the 1940s as opposed to a modern restaurant in Tribeca. The food and decor is supposed to be inspired from the era where Portugal had a colony in China. If the food recipe is accurate, one would conclude that soy sauce was used heavily in that colony. I ordered the Peking Style Pork Ribs with a side of fried rice and nibbled on other dishes of people sitting next to me. The dishes were served with decent portions, tasty, and definitely  unique but I just couldn't ignore the heavy use of soy sauce. For dessert, I had the Coconut Panna Cotta and the Portuguese doughnuts with rum sauce. Both great but everyone in our table attacked the Portuguese doughnuts. Since the place is not very large, they were able to provide attentive service to all the tables. I was informed that they also have a lounge in the basement but I did not get a chance to check it out.

I can't spell our servers name but she was a very nice asian yound woman (I want to say Jin but.....) she described the food and the wine and was really nice and helpful. we both liked her a lot.

It felt like they were trying to get my family to hurry up so they can use the table when multiple waiters wanted to take away plates even though we weren't finished eating. We sat at the worst table even though several tables around were empty. A stack of napkins fell near my 4 year old because they were stacked next to where she was seated along with a bottle of cleaning product that was nearby. The staff was friendly but will say they my experience was not great at all. I'm not sure if this is because we had two young kids that we got worse table in the house but will no recommend or be going back. The pasta we got was actually pretty good and cocktails were delicious.

Wailana W.,/user_details?userid=gEnzvwRpeGam6UBV66Wp1g,"New York, NY",3/9/2018,4.0,"So good and simple.  Started with grilled octopus, perfect size for two.  The beet and goat cheese ravioli hit the spot.  I don't usually order pasta or cheese  but this was not too heavy or cheesey. It made me want more but I felt satisfied.  My bf's hanger steak was okay.  It had a side salad so for Paleoans it was a healthy portion and combination.  We shared a classic molten chocolate cake with berries and cream and after it was finished, everything in the world seemed fine.  Gersi has a following now so on Friday nights, expect a wait for a table or be seated at the bar.  It seems to be the hot new spot in CG/CH.  Kudos to them for serving unpretentious food that can be regular fare for families and folks in the area.  Prices are reasonable because it's cash only.  Don't know why they don't take credit cards but if they did, it probably would be even harder to get in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gersi-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Both were nicely presented and delicious. My side salad was fresh and not over dressed.  I did check out the back yard for possible meals but as someone mentioned it's not really set up well as the top tent, which would be mostly fine on its own, has side coverings which ends up making the space more enclosed then it should be in this COVID sensitive times. Also as a matter of safety the above large fan is actually forcing air downward which is pushing the warm exhaled air of the diners back down, again not the type of air flow you want.  Nevertheless while I wont be using the back yard I would definitely return to eat at one of the sidewalk tables.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gersi-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We visited on a Friday night, when other plans were cancelled, made last minute reservations and were accommodated right away. The place was packed when we first walked in, as to be expected, but to my pleasant surprise we were escorted to the back where they had a beautiful seating area in an outside tent. I wanted to try everything on the menu as they had an array of options but we went with the brussel sprouts and bruschetta (both were equally delicious and refreshing) for our appetizers and for our entrees we had the spaghetti limone and the skirt steak (cooked and flavored to perfection). The server was very attentive and even offered up a wine suggestion to my partner for her spaghetti, which she loved. After we discussed dessert, as we usually don't eat dessert at the same place we eat dinner, but the server offered us a tempting dessert menu. After looking it over we decided to go with the chocolate lava cake and the vanilla panna cotta. My partner loved her lava cake, the panna cotta could have used a little more flavor/sweetness but was smooth and creamy. Needless to say overall it was a great experience.

The complimentary bread and bean dip was fantastic, and we also had the watermelon basil as an appetizer which was delicious. My dad got the pork chop and raved about every single bite - said it's the best pork chop he's ever had. He even raved over the steamed broccoli on the side! I had the most interesting dish and didn't know what to expect - grilled polenta with prosciutto and parmesan- and it was so incredibly delicious!!! We must have told the owner 10x how much we were loving our food. We had to try the dessert too and had the most perfectly cooked molten lava cake with insanely delicious whipped cream. I sound like a broken record but the food here is really worth writing home (or to Yelp) about!!  The decor and ambiance is also great - loved the open kitchen and the backyard garden, and the bathroom is beautiful!!  I predict in a couple months they'll have a line out the door.  It only got better when we got the bill - prices are so reasonable and portions are large.

C W.,/user_details?userid=23SvF_J9t2DmUZMd5CwzZg,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",11/11/2018,2.0,"I called Gersi several times before we went there and they do not answer their phone nor did they have a recorded message for information. We did not make a reservation and were not sure if it was open so when we arrived we were informed that the only seating available was for people who made a reservation. Wish the communication from them was better. Since we were hungry and didn't have time to find another restaurant we sat at the bar to eat. We ordered an asparagus appetizer to share, a grilled skirt steak, the Pappardelle with lamb ragu and Homemade Tagliatelle Bolognese. The appetizer was a bit pricey for the amount you get - 7 stalks for $13.95.  The skirt steak was good. It was marinated well and cooked exactly as ordered. It is served on a thick slice of bread which soaks up all of the juice. Next time I would order it without the bread or have it on the side. The pasta dishes were way overcooked and both sauces were overly salted. We were not impressed with either dish and would not order pasta again if we decide to return. Overall the atmosphere is good and the servers were attentive enough. We did not complain about the food while we were there because it was edible but definitely nothing outstanding. A pet peeve of mine is over salted food.

The food is delicious and nicely presented without being pretentious; the servings are generous without being sloppy. It accepts reservations and offers daily specials. I was there on New Year's Eve, and it was packed, but the whole meal went down without any mistakes or complications. They didn't rush to get our group out, even though there was clearly a crowd waiting to get in. I know this all seems very basic, but it seems more often than not restaurants fail to meet some of these basic rules of hospitality--and I want to properly thank the Gersi staff for making my NYE special.

Upon arriving on time for our reservation, we were told that they were running behind - this was said in a very rudimentary, unapologetic manner with little elaboration. We were not in a rush, so waited patiently outside, but it became more and more apparent that the hostess had no idea how to handle the situation - instead of keeping us up to date on the status of our table, she continuously mumbled vague apologies and seemed uncomfortable, but offered no solutions or hospitality. Finally, after waiting 25 minutes past our reservation time, we asked if any tables were wrapping up and she said they were just finishing up their food - unclear as to whether they were going to get dessert, more drinks, etc. There was no forthrightness and the restaurant was clearly being poorly managed on a holiday.

Sometimes I feel like if youve been to one Italian restaurant youve been to them all, but this was actually different. I am Italian and have been to enough to know this place is on the money. Fresh ingredients that dont try to hard and end up coming together to be great. We shared the Siclian salad with ricotta salata (delish but a bit too cold for me) and the roasted garlic bruschetta with palmigiano cheese (excellent). For our entre my husband got the Rigatoni mezzi with meatballs and sausage. I gotthe spaghetti al limone which if you like lemon is excellent. A few simple, fresh ingredients and viola...fantastic. I must also add that being a meatball snob means its really hard to try someone elses meatballs let alone like them and they were really surprisingly good. Tiramisu and capuccino for dessert, also good. I felt compelled to approach a man that I thought was the manager to tell him it was great.

The decor is beautifully charming, the staff is extremely attentive and warm, and the food was stellar! Gersi is brand new, and is already one of my girlfriend and mine's favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. We ate out back on their patio which is beautifully designed, covered in plants and herb gardens, and continues the same charm as the rest of their restaurant. We ordered the Bresaola to start (which is AMAZING), and two beautifully made pasta dishes, spaghetti limon and the bolognese Ragu. Both were exceptional; simple and sensationally seasoned. Everything is extremely fresh and made on the premises, including the perfectly cooked homemade pasta. Gersi the owner, whom the place is named after, greeted us  when we sat down and pointed us to a delicious Barbera to start. He is Albanian and we quickly I bonded over the fact that I have been to Albania before and that the Italian food was incredible there. He assured me that he I would like the meal then, and he was absolutely right. Gersi completely lived up to the real deal! We spoke with him throughout the night and found him to be extremely sweet, soft spoken and accommodating.

The staff is very nice, the space is very clean and well set up, it was the food where they lost me. I got their namesake bowl for lunch. The sauce was quite tasty, but the problem was that almost all it was was tortilla chips drowned in the sauce. There was very little of the meat protein I had chosen, barely a couple of small bites in the entire bowl. I would equate it to a serving the size of a single slice of bacon, and maybe not even that.  I came away still hungry for some protein.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-chilaquer%C3%ADa-new-york-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Joyce K.,/user_details?userid=XHET80aOWBvNXlMhSCM7bg,"New Brunswick, NJ",8/20/2022,3.0,"My friend and I were able to get a table outside in the covered seating at Mom's Kitchen and Bar at about 8 pm on a Saturday evening. She ordered the Mac & cheese pancake due to the intriguing nature of the dish and I stuck with the classics and got the chicken and bacon waffle. The pancake was very interesting in that the mac and cheese was incorporated into the pancake batter and was not served separately with the pancakes as one may have anticipated. They clearly added the macaroni and the cheese separately into the batter as the macaroni was largely tasteless. However, they definitely get points for inventiveness. My chicken and bacon waffle was pretty good, nothing special, but I wish there were smaller chunks of chicken for easier consumption and a crispier waffle. We shared the cookie stand milkshake at the conclusion of our meal, and our first impression was that the shake should have been bigger for the price we paid. However, they were very accommodating once we told them that we were sharing as they gave us two straws and two spoons in a mug. The paper straws sadly made it difficult to drink the slurp up the milkshake since I guess the mixture would get stuck on the paper. Overall, the restaurant had interesting decor and dishes but at times we felt neglected by the service and if eating outside, the fans are quite aggressive when turned on.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/moms-kitchen-and-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kristen S.,/user_details?userid=qiYB7TorQIlYLSNQCORK6A,"St Petersburg, FL",7/24/2022,5.0,I saw this place on Yelp and when I was just walking around hell's kitchen the night before I came across it. The menu looked very very interesting and it looks like a cute little place to pop in for breakfast or brunch. I was very intrigued by the menu creations such as the macaroni and cheese pancakes. I came here on my last day in New York for breakfast and the waiter recommended to me the burrito pancake as one of the customer favorites. I figured I've never tried a pancake burrito in my life so why not try 1 now. 1st of all even though I pretty much ate all of it this is definitely something you could split with someone else. Whoever came up with the genius idea of a pancake burrito needs an award lol. It was so delicious and the pancake was fluffy and flavorful. The addition of the fillings were great. I will say Hell's kitchen had some of best selection of restaurants in Manhattan that I saw while there. We need a location in Tampa Bay hint hint lol.

We had like a 10 min wait, which wasn't bad for a Sunday morning. Staff was friendly and we didn't wait long for our food and the place was packed. Menu had lots of good sounding options, but the sweet tooth kid in me opted for the Bedrock Pancakes. I was in all my glory as this was everything I hoped for and more. I mean fruity pebbles in big fluffy pancakes topped with blueberries and strawberries. Seemed like everyone around us was getting the same thing. I'll say it's probably a staple here. My wife got the woodland omelet and loved it. It was a ton of food and she couldn't finish it. We had to split the How the Grinch Stole Christmas seasonal shake.

Andy S.,/user_details?userid=BGdBwrcKG7tL5TxVo_eFmQ,"North Canton, OH",5/3/2022,2.0,Had the breakfast sandwich with home fries. Well that ain't bacon and those aren't home fries. The bacon was tough and stringy like beef jerky. I actually had to chew it for a long time. Tasted like it was days old bacon that wasn't cooked right when it was fresh. A few pieces were so hard I had to remove them from the sandwich. Diced sweet potatoes and red potatoes just aren't home fries without peppers and onions. Those are diced sweet potatoes and red potatoes. Waitress was very nice and food was served fast. This was a Tuesday morning at 930 am.

Pete G.,/user_details?userid=IpZjrg0zDcKE0QLo1BMofg,"New York, NY",7/10/2022,2.0,"IMHO totally overrated. My breakfast sandwich and ""home fries"" were completely bland. What they call home fries is basically potato and sweet potato chunks, but both equally flavorless. Thick cut bacon on the sandwich is a poor choice, as the eggs are soft and crumbly, leading to a messy tug of war as you try to bite both. $5 bodega egg sandwiches are better and easier to eat.

Julio R.,/user_details?userid=wTPvOuCsr2NkePlnvZL2HQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/12/2022,5.0,"My review of Mom's restaurant and bar located on the northwest corner of 48th Street and 9th avenue in Hell's kitchen. Today is Sunday June 12th 2022 when I walked into Mom's restaurant and bar I found myself back in time on June 12th 1976. Cartoons on the big screen TV, those old 10 lunch boxes we had when we were kids holding the condiments on the table. Photos of memorabilia of TV shows from 1970s and before. The music was disco from the 1970s as well playing at a volume that was high enough to enjoy yet low enough to have a conversation with your fellow peers. I had the chicken bacon waffle for breakfast. Which had great reviews on Yelp and wish they highly recommend as well and with good reason, it's their best seller. As I was walking out I passed from some patrons and told them the food he was so good and they told me they already knew that and they look very happy to be there. The chicken bacon waffle consists of a Belgian waffle topped with a sweet honey syrup and about three pieces of thick bacon. Then on top of that they add two pieces of fried chicken breast very crispy and they cover that in cheese I forget which kind and the cheese has bacon bits in it. I recommend you let the bacon melt a bit when it's served for more enjoyable eating experience. I'm going to say what lots of food critics say and that is if you go anywhere for breakfast and Hell's kitchen go to Mom's restaurant and bar for breakfast you can't go wrong. This day's got to be the single most enjoyable eating experience I've had in a while. In closing I want to add that I first visited mom's back when they first opened and I had their breakfast sandwich and it was great wonderful service quick and courteous the food was excellent. That may have been as far back as 2017 I'm glad you're still around. Thank you Mom I will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/moms-kitchen-and-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I can't say that both times that we went the food was great, the ambience was great and the staff is just GREAT! The first time we went the kids and I sat inside. My son ordered the Buffalo Mac N Cheese balls, my daughter had the avocado toast and I had the Bedrock Pancakes. We all really enjoyed the food...although I think we all liked my pancakes the best since my son finished what I couldn't. The second time we went we sat outside to enjoy the great weather that morning and it was just as wonderful. I ordered the pancakes again and this time so did my son and daughter and then my husband ordered the shrimp and grits. This day my husband received his coffee in a mug that had lipstick stains on it but the staff was on it and quickly exchanged it out. Then we all got our food and my husband again had his breakfast order mixed up and given the wrong thing....but once again the staff was on it and quickly made it right.

Good stuff, yes;good for you, no. Nonetheless, we couldn't finish the portions and glad we decided not to order any sides. The dishes were brought out quickly and were still hot when we finished. I do think, though, the pancake, should have been a bit thinner, because I really had a hard time coming close to finishing it and ate about a half as it was super filling.

We were very excited to try this place based on the reviews. Sadly we were very disappointed in the food we received. We started with a appetizer of wings and there wasn't any flavor very bland. Then we ordered the shrimp and grits and steak and eggs with fries. The shrimp and grits was not worth the cost we had a big plate of grits with 5 shrimp. And the steak was very bland no flavor and I thought I was getting fries but I just got big chopped up potatoes and sweet potatoes with a lot of salt. Also I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese but I got scrambled eggs with a slice of cheese on top.

Khanh N.,/user_details?userid=kjjivUvfP3lKJ4aeyFFJjA,"Piscataway Township, NJ",11/14/2020,4.0,Mom's is like that dope vibe restaurant that serves brunch all day. COVID has been hard but they really do make the best of it here by providing sanitizer everywhere and distancing each table. Menus are on the QR code and I would definitely recommend getting the breakfast items here. Be aware that there's a cheese overload on the dishes. I had opted for the shrimp and cheese grits and my bf had gotten the chicken and waffles. I had thoroughly enjoyed both and had filled me up quick. I've only afr half of my frits and I was good to go lol. This is my first time eating grits and it was everything I had imagined. The chicken and waffles were good but I would suggest to get the cheese on the side even though it looks picture worthy if they put it on for you. I would def come back here whenever i'm in the area craving for brunch. We had stopped by on a saturday night and parking was a bit yikes though.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/moms-kitchen-and-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The decor gave us that nostalgic feel and the music from the 80's and 90's was so appreciated. The menu was just a who's who of delicious food and took us a bit to pin point what to get because everything looked good. The steak was delicious with the overeasy eggs and potatoes and my wife's chicken and gravy was awesome. The portion was a lot so one got their money's worth. But wait, there's more. On came desert and it was literally the icing on the date night. My pumpkin pie float with a slice of pie on it was the greatest thing I have ever seen and tasted. I felt like a happy kid in an ice cream shop. I wanted another one but had to leave something for the other customers (lol). Also excellent was the service - all of the staff is friendly and attentive but special shout-out to Raquel, our waitress who helped guide us, had some good conversation with her, recommended her favorites and added to the great night out. We are definitely going back to try the other things and recommend any one else looking for a fun, delicious, cool night out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/moms-kitchen-and-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

And there's not even a close second... And I love food. The shrimp and grits were sublime. Unfortunately I was kind of full by the time I got to them.  The breakfast sandwich do not seem on the same level as everything else. But the salad was excellent with the grape vinaigrette dressing.

Cheeseburger was super dry, the tomato soup was missing an oil or cream element to make it comforting. It was very acidic and immediately dissolved on your tongue into flavorless nothingness, also came with a dry breadstick that was supposed to be cheesy. The Mac and cheese balls were missing the crunch and were similar to mush balls, also served on lettuce like it's 2010. I thought the general consensus was we don't do hot lettuce anymore? The pickle slaw had awesome flavor but a bit too many onions. Probably should have just got the sweet stuff like the pebbles pancake but I'm not going back to find out.

Rachele T.,/user_details?userid=5HbyzzlaVcl4TMCx9ubO_A,"Las Vegas, NV",7/27/2021,5.0,Postponed review but me and my boyfriend came here on our last day of our NY trip since it was very close and had great reviews. I was a little intimidated about the food since the plates looked large and very heavy (for breakfast.) Our server was okay nothing special but not rude or any of that. We were waiting for about 20 minutes after we received our drinks and we were saying to each other maybe they forgot about us (jokingly). But I said maybe this is the typical wait time (having no idea). A different waiter approached us and asked if we are still waiting and we said yes to which our server came to apologize about the wait and we said it was fine. The manager came out shortly after to offer apologies AND offered us a free milkshake for the inconvenience! I was honestly shocked because we weren't angry or anything but she still went above and beyond on a customer service level! We did end up getting the Nutella milkshake (just to try it ofc). The chicken and waffle was amazing! I've never tried that combo because I was afraid of the sweet maple syrup but it was for sure the best combination of flavors and a very generous portion. My boyfriend had the shrimps and grits which was equally good! The milkshake was a little too chocolatey for me but the Rice Krispies in it made it amazing. 10/10 we were very happy with this spot! Amazing customer service from the manager and amazing food for sure one of our fav breakfast spots we tried on our trip!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/moms-kitchen-and-bar-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My mom is not an adventurous eater and has high food standards so for her to ask to go back to Mom's for a second meal means the restaurant was a hit! I loved Mom's not just for the food but because of the 90's and early 2000's nostalgia. If you're a millennial, then it feels like you've been transported back to middle school just with alcoholic drinks! The drinks were just ok but they featured candy and even inflatable toys so that was more of the draw. The menu is on notebook paper replicas and the decor includes old school lunchboxes. The food was comfort food and actually really good. Most restaurants that have a cool niche or are Instagram worthy typically have subpar food, but not Mom's! The food was the highlight here. I recommend the shrimp and grits, French toast, and pancake burrito.

The bedrock pancakes are huge, very sweet and comes with a mix of berries on top.

As soon as we were seated I immediately wanted to leave because the look and feel of the place seemed dark and a bit dirty.

I decided to look at the food pictures posted on yelp and the shakes looked good so I decided to order one from the picture I saw.

We sat at the counter since there were only two of us and we didn't want to wait for a table. Mom's has the ambiance & vibe figured out - ""diner""-esque, but still modern and photo-worthy. The egg white scramble was fine, nothing crazy good but not bad either. Home fries are basically just a combo of potato & sweet potato chunks but I really liked them!

He made me feel right at home and was full of knowledge and hospitality. I also ordered a yummy MOM-osa....these things are HUGE! Service: 10/10. Food: 10/10. Worth it? YES.
