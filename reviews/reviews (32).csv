Also don't let them seat you at the raw bar, it's way too close to the kitchen and people are whizzing by with plates constantly, making it way too tight and uncomfortable to enjoy your meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/saraghina-caff%C3%A8-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Laila P.,/user_details?userid=X81HHthtJLBJA3viHK5gWg,"New York, NY",4/22/2022,1.0,"I'm going to be honest here and tell you that I'm not really going to talk about the food. It was alright. I'm not a food critic and I'm not going to pretend to be. Was it worth the over $300 it cost? Not really, in my opinion. The steak was overwhelmingly salty, the portions were small and highly priced, the meringue was mostly whipped cream and I actually have no idea what part of it was meringue but I digress. I've had meals I enjoyed more for considerably less, but then again, my taste is not yours, and I am not going to impress it upon you. What I am going to talk about is the fact that Saraghina is one of the most egregious examples of  gentrification I have seen yet. The air is infected with a sort of wealthy self importance that I have never found even in small amounts to be pleasant, and especially not in this case, where it permeates the very tile. I was even rushed out after my exceptionally overpriced meal and told to leave because ""there are people waiting for your spot."" I am every bit sympathetic to accommodating other people, but the complete lack of tact with which it was brought up was palpable, like a cloying, sickly sweet perfume worn by someone with a demeanor that expresses cleanly and plainly that they think you are not worth their time. There are many beautiful and unique restaurants across New York City that display the vast array of cultures and people that live here. This embarrassingly over-gilded ""upper crust"" establishment is as far as anything can be from what makes NYC special, and I urge you to support smaller local businesses across the city that both need and actually deserve your patronage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/saraghina-caff%C3%A8-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

That's all I have for the positives. The food offered was lackluster. Octopus and mashed potatoes dish and the jamon croquet was decent. The main reason for my review is the fideo paella ($25) which is a supposed to be a Valencian style noodle (short stick noodles) with seafood. Instead, I'm pretty sure I was served boxed kraft macaroni. And a very stingy portion of seafood (2 shrimp, 2 mussels). Flavor wise, it need salt and pepper. I wouldn't suggest to have a full meal here, possible a filler in between schedule.

In the back they serve tapas and pinxos, which you can take out or eat in a lovely white-tiled side room. If you're eating in and want wine, just go next door to their wine shop and they'll provide the glasses.

Everything I have tried is pretty amazing. The jamon is extremely pricey but worth it. Service is polite if a bit quiet because of the language barrier (they all speak spanish). The new sommelier wine consultant is a wizard. She picked out an amazing bottle of red based on our preferences. Full body, not too tannic, fruit but dry. She gave us the background on the wine...It came from grape vines that were over 200 years old and untouched by phylloxera so they were gnarly and beautiful. It was amazing. And, I love sitting in the back surrounded by cool marble. A quiet little oasis amidst the bustle. The wines are $10+.

David H.,/user_details?userid=SMInAhku2BYErCj0ObH3kg,"Los Angeles, CA",1/1/2017,1.0,"I trekked 35 minutes there because of the rave reviews. Disappointing! The bread in the chorizo was dry with flaky skin, a sure sign of stale bread re-heated. The jambon and cheese were high sodium, which were to be expected for Spanish ham and cheese. But the ham had absolutely not the distinct flavor or aroma like the Serrano or other ham I had in Spain and D.C. The cheese cake, small by US standard, was OK and the blueberries were fresh enough. (Then a baker has to be really inept to screw up a cheesecake right?) The vino tinto (Mibal) at $12 was the best part, smooth and aromatic. The whole bill came to $28.41 not including tip, expensive when one considers the food taste and quantity, and that it is a walk-up-to-order eatery attached to their store.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/despa%C3%B1a-fine-foods-and-tapas-cafe-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was quite different from the Puerto Rican or Colombian dishes that I was use to. As I walked through the door my mouth started to water. The smell was enticing. My vision was filled with fancy bottles of jams, cheeses, and oils. I want it all !! Quickly I began to search for the tables and a menu. I finally found the tables all the way in the back, along with the menu. First thought was, so many choices to choose from. What do i choose? Tortilla & idiazabal and chorizo in apple cider was the first things that I ordered. It was sort of a potato cheese with cured ham mini sandwich. It was quite a treat especially the chorizo . This made me quickly go back to the counter to order more things. Next up was Quijote. If there's anything to try this is it. Dry cured pork loin (lomo) with Manchego cheese and quince spread. Wow!! The flavor of the pork, cheese and quince blended so well together. It was such a delight that I had to take small bites so that I could savior the taste.

A hispanic woman comes over and starts complaining in spanish that if we are thinking of eating that sandwich in the store we cannot and on and on for 5 minutes until my wife interrupted the constant back and forth since she understands Spanish and said we had already said we are not eating the sandwich in the store I think I am allowed to buy the meats separately to make a sandwich right?! then she was like playing dumb and said ""Oh I don't know I don't  know I don't speak english"" and left.  then the guy started complaining that he could not find his carving knife and made a big stink of complaining of having to slice the meat for us.  After having bought the bread and all the stuffings which again was really not much more in terms of portion size for 40 dollars we asked if he could use the knife to slice the bread in half and he said he could not do that.  We asked if we could use a knife he said no, we asked if his kitchen staff could cut it in half he said they are too busy.  There was another couple standing next to us and one couple already eating and he is saying the kitchen staff is too busy to slice a piece of bread in half so we could eat it in the park.  The items or overpriced the quality of the products has gone down and the service is horrible.  If more people in spain have that kind of attitude toward service then it is no wonder Spain's economy is in the state it is.  You are not doing anyone favors and you are not the only place for people to get products from Spain.  Your attitude and service is pathetic and an insult to what Spanish hospitality should be.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/despa%C3%B1a-fine-foods-and-tapas-cafe-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The burger is good (a little dry) but there are better burgers for less money all over the neighborhood. Every other dish relies on the primacy of one flavor (garlic, salt, cheese) and is no better than a meal one could cook for themselves for a fraction of the cost.

I've been a patron of this place since I moved to the south side 17 years ago. Tonight may the last night I ever eat here. Having been many times before, I know how amazing the quality of the steak is, but tonight I'm afraid something was way off. I received a cold, chewy 8oz piece of meat, that seemed to attract the staff as if they were wondering if I'd be daring enough to take a bite. Not being one to complain or send it back, I tried riding it out for a few bites until I had no choice but to become my mother and issue a complaint. Well, typically at this point the kitchen admits they've overcooked it or that it sat on the counter ten minutes too long. Nope, tonight they doubled down and simply ""heated it up"" for me, which took ten minutes and did nothing. I barely touched it, which was obvious to the staff. they offered me a drink, but hardly an apology or a discount on the $45 that went off into the wind tonight. But worse than that, I feel betrayed. It's as if an old friend told me they don't care about me anymore. Except I had to pay to hear it. Farewell, Diner.

The salad of ""lettuces"" happened to be a plate of ridicchio, and I was delivered empty containers of condiments for my burger. The night just went from bad to worse. Then, to top it off, my friend's short ribs were all fat. Not one member of our party of five felt positively about the food.

You really have to pay attention to the server or you might not be really eating. They do have a small menu listing about 4 dishes. But there's plenty off menu. I'm assuming they change it up? Although the experience was different I didn't find too much excitement in the food.

J.

Three of us put in our names and were called back about 30-45 minutes later. We were in the back room which is a little claustrophobic but generally ok. The waitress sat next to us and wrote out that day's menu on the paper table top. It changes all the time except for the burger. We tried a mussels dish which was more of a salad. My only gripe would be that there were only a few mussels. We had a mixed salad which was fine. I had the attic char which was very nice. The buttermilk sauce was not too thick or heavy. I tried the chicken which was good though it came with polenta which I generally disk like. My friend had the beef cheek which was good though a tad dry. Is definitely come back to try new dishes. Very reasonably priced.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/diner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Bill Y.,/user_details?userid=1cnJPUKBegULm4W1JhoE3g,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",7/6/2017,5.0,"As a father of five, I have to say that I love Diner! They offer a rotating menu of dishes that have never left me disappointed. In lieu of a standard paper menu, the waiters and waitresses write the day's offerings directly on the paper tablecloth. This delighted my children! They were so impressed that they've been inspired to taking markers to my wife's great grandmother's linen table clothes at home to list and comment on the dishes that I cook at home. My middle son has used this newly discovered artistic venue to scribble long and convoluted criticisms of his father's preparation of Hamburger Helper, sometimes extending past the limits of the tablecloth and onto the carpet and up the walls. Now I know that once you have a taste of the delicious pork chops prepared by the wonderful chefs at Diner your father's Hamburger Helper recipes might be a bit disappointing, however my son's extensive manifestos extend far beyond the realms of food criticism and devolve into attacks of a deeply personal nature. Not that I blame any of this on Diner; in fact, our meal there provided teachable moments regarding not only the differences between disposable paper tablecloths and priceless family heirlooms, but also about the boundaries between freedom of speech and libel.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/diner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'm not a fan of having the waiter scribble the menu on the paper table covering, which I didn't know about beforehand, but has been Diner's thing since forever. Our waiter used cursive, the items had to be read sideways, and if you're a first timer they aren't easy to remember because Diner's brunch is atypical - very hip, and food combinations / descriptions can seem puzzling and somewhat random. Would you like preserved swordfish for brunch? Or are you more in the mood for a meal of peach cake?

The reason you ask, for a review before even eating the food? Here's your answer: I ordered the pork chop. Our waitress, who is fantastic, came back to the table a few minutes later to inform me that they were out (I had other amazing options, don't fret, like my go to, the burger). So no biggie. I ordered something else and took a swig of my beer. Ten minutes later the manager came over, had heard that I really wanted a chop (I did, I've never actually ordered one in a restaurant, weird right?), he had ran down the street to their butcher shop, got me a freakin chop, and ran back. Now it's being cooked. If that ain't service I don't know what is.

Delphine P.,/user_details?userid=uTQLDYTNXxmYeoQNT0L0kg,"Highland Park, Los Angeles, CA",4/23/2016,2.0,"We sat at the bar one weekend night and ordered drinks and dessert. Diner is open late, which is great. The two desserts we had were meh - rice pudding and a brioche with lemon curd. The rice pudding's texture was mealy and grainy, though the flavor was okay. The brioche was dry and nearly inedible. I would skip both. The barkeep, a woman with glasses, was nice but hovered around us a lot and it was not a terribly pleasant experience. She kept standing there watching us and asked us too many times if we wanted more drinks or the check or anything else or if we were okay or if the deserts were good or how we were doing. She had good intentions, I'm sure, but her near constant presence was a bit oppressive and disruptive - we always had the sensation of being watched. This interrupted our flow of conversation and made us uncomfortable, but we tipped her 20% anyway because we thought she probably thought that she was being attentive rather than oppressive. But if management sees this, perhaps you can advise the barkeep to give the customers a little breathing room.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/diner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Fred M.,/user_details?userid=XR8Qep44SeXosPWhVaQdsQ,"Manhattan, NY",5/13/2018,2.0,"I don't mean to sound naive. You go to diner for their grass fed burger which at $25 is not a cheap burger but it's very well executed. Last night I didn't feel like a burger and wanted to try something else. It was a big blunder. The dandelion and fava bean puree appetizer was as close to inedible as you can get for $20: mushy puree topped with burned bitter greens topped with charred bread. If you were lost in the wild and all you had left was a couple matches, some stale bread and local primitive grasses you'd come up with a better, tastier dish. $30 lamb meatballs followed. Three meatballs at $10 a meatball accompanied by your traditional yogurt sauce and arugula. The most striking aspect of this dish has to be the $100/lb ground lamb. One cannot ignore the rest of the menu which is handwritten and presented very cleverly on cashier's paper; perhaps to confuse the eye (does that really say $30?) or perhaps because some prices are too outrageous for print. A lamb entree for $80 which the waiter is quick to point out consists of 4 lamb chops. And there you have it; just when you thought you've experienced shameless - a $20 lamb chop.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/diner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Both were delicous but my boyfriend was wishing that his portion was a little bigger. For dessert we had a Maple syrup custard with ginger cookies... yummmm. It was suprisingly light and refreshing.

The place was super crowded but the staff was very helpful in trying to get us seated. We only waited about 5 minutes which was impressive.  The seating is very right which means I was able to follow the hipsters conversations on either side of us. Nonetheless the experience was great. Our waitress wrote the specials on the white paper table cloth.  Nice touch.  And from what I understand the menu changes daily with what is locally fresh.   We started with a sardine app which had Beats mandarin slices with a homemade cream.    Ridic!  My lovely gf had the lobster omelette. Perfectly done. Lobster was plentiful in a nice sauce wrapped by a moist omelette .  Sided with cubed potatoes with made from scratch ketchup.  I had the duck hearts with collard greens over a light egg salad.  the duck hearts were cooked perfectly and the flavor was brain meltingly good.  Highly highly recommended for anyone who appreciates the culinary arts.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/diner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Green sauce was pretty bland too and the tortillas were completely soggy. Should have known better to save the Mexican food for a real Mexican restaurant.

It also cost $38, which is a few dollar away from steak house pricing. i have no problem paying for good food but this was just a joke. We also had the burger which also was only served medium. This was served rare and the red soggy bun on bottom was clear evidence they have no clue how to cook even the most basic form of beef. Lets not forget this is the one recurring item on the menu. it was so salty it was barely edible. My girlfriend choked down half, i had one bite and left the rest on the plate. I cant remember the last time i didn't finish a meal and declined to bring home left overs.

I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  We wanted to try the donut holes but they were out.  The biscuits were really dense but really delicious.  The gravy wasn't traditional sausage gravy (it could have been thicker and creamier) but was equally as delicious.  And a nice little surprise were two poached eggs on top of the whole set up.  All for about 12 bucks.  So I give Diner a good solid 4 stars.  Not 5 because it didn't blow my mind but hey where else can you go eat brunch while Interpol's Antics is bumping through the speakers?

The arugula salad I had was exactly what  I wanted and the dressing took just enough of the bite away for the it to be satisfying. The burger was OK, but not anything super special. I've had better burgers at Brooklyn Public House (just thinking about that place makes my mouth water). The staff is pretty attentive but I confess that we went late on an off night and there were only two tables to serve. They woman taking the order came out and quickly pulled an extensive list of daily specials from her brain and wrote them down in her version of shorthand on the paper table cloth - this was interesting and pretty cool but well, unreadable lol.

Allison H.,/user_details?userid=qlZ2dmgTN-pqyrPqlGL29g,"Jersey City, NJ",10/8/2009,3.0,"The place was cozy. Incredibly so. Table on top of banquette table on top of plaid shirted waitress on top of ironic glasses wearing customers on top of let me write the entire menu down with the exception of our Anthony Bourdain approved cheeseburger in illegible semi-script on your paper table ""cloth"" (sans prices I might add) because we're too cool to use actual menus - how rare for a restaurant, an old restaurant to be able to retain it's unabashed ""hipster relevance"" still after all these years. So sure, Diner is iconic of a certain post-collegiate, Daily Show worshipping clientele whose biggest concerns of the day are probably not forgetting to TiVo Mad Men, measuring out their Carbon Footprint, and fretting over how to perfectly coif their facial hair, but does that make the food any good? As a big lover of these folks' newer ventures (see: Marlowe & Sons), for my hard earned buck, I'd rather be eating over there. It's not that the food wasn't good at Diner per say, it's just that it was incredibly ok. For a spot that received such glowing reviews in the past and is experiencing something of a second coming given the success of Marlowe, I have to say I was expecting more than an inedibly frozen slice of Spice Cake for desert, a corn bread ""salad"" appetizer that  felt oddly unsatisfying  - it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything I would crave at 3 AM on a Friday evening after a night of too many drinks.  The main courses faired slightly better: my pork chop was salty and moist and vaguely smokey and definitely made me feel like less of a Jew for enjoying it so much. However, in truth, I only ordered the pork chop because it was supposed to come with an ""eggplant mascarpone,"" and if I'm a lover of anything it's eggplant and mascarpones. When my plate arrived, I search for the eggplant marscapone but it was nowhere to be found!? Where did you go eggplant marscapone? And then there was the ""award winning"" burger. Why does it seem like every restaurant I set foot in has an ""award winning burger""? From the Corner Bistro to The Spotted Pig- it doesn't matter if you're lost in Williamsburg Brooklyn or standing in the middle of Park Avenue, I would wager you are probably no more the three block from some place whose burger is ""award winning.""  So yes, the burger at Diner is delicious - the meat moist and juicy and the addition of pickled onions certainly a nice touch - I admired it's simplicity, but really was it memorable, deserving of awards? I think not. It was a ""solid"" cheeseburger, but perhaps I would've liked it more if there were some other options on the ""menu"" that were healthier and I wasn't feeling obliged/coerced/manipulated to order this burger. C'mon Diner, NO FISH on the entire menu!?!? Not cool. As the meal wound to a close I found that I adored my company and the completely obliging service and the general ambience of being around folks discussing when Sufjan Stevens' new record was coming out - however no matter how much I would've liked to, I just didn't adore the food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/diner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The food was delicious. We had parmesan soup, arugula salad with hazelnuts and grilled pear, and ribeye for two, and enjoyed everything immensely. I actually didn't really care for hearing the menu (and seeing the summary of it on the paper) from the waitress. Thought it took way too long. I can understand it for restaurants that have a very short menu, but their menu's not exactly small. The only dish I didn't like was the side watercress salad that was served with the ribeye. It was rather one-dimensional, and I'm not a huge fan of watercress on top of that. Other than that, totally happy with the experience here.

lorenza t.,/user_details?userid=K1CzPBT3rMhlFimibSUq-w,"Greenpoint, NY",8/17/2008,4.0,"I've been coming to diner with my honey and two friends for the past 6 years, nearly every friday night. I remember it as a greasy spoon palace, when the ribeye was soaking in grease and so were the fries, the air was heavy with smoke, and the waitrons were hot as nails. I lost my affection for the place when they stopped serving red meat a few years back (allegedly because the chef refused to work with such low-quality beef). Thankfully they brought back the steaks, though family style like ol' peter luger down the street -- and the family-style steaks are at peter luger prices. I would avoid the individual steaks, especially the flatiron (your cheap-o option in the grocery store) because the family-style is almost always heavenly. We always order the family-style steaks if they're available, and we still love the fresh menu and the waitstaff. The owners, mark and andrew, are sweethearts with business acumen, especially mark, who's always quick with the quips. In all, I've had a very long-term relationship with diner, and I still adore it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/diner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Joe V.,/user_details?userid=WDfETOsPNnPZRRW0DMHQPQ,"Brooklyn, NY",11/12/2008,2.0,"I hope this review will help Diner improve because the place has potential to be a good spot. The atmosphere is what you come to Wiliamsburg for, eclectic, electric, creative. But that's where it stops. The menu is limited, if not just plain weird. The food is not good, and it's not hard to make a good burger or even a chicken sandwich.

I heard from a friend that they have really great burgers so a few of us went in to try.  It was the day after St. Patrick's day we were nurshing hangovers and only drinking water.  When we ordered burgers the waiter looked annoyed and then completely ignored us for the remainder of the evening.  We had to go up to the bar and grab another bottle of water after waiting 20 minutes for a refill.  He didn't even stop by to see if we were enjoying the food.  Another server delivered the food and the hostess dropped the check.  It killed me to leave him a tip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/diner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
