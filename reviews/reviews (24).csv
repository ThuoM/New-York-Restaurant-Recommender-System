My husband ordered the pork chop and was not disappointed, as he is usually upset with portion sizes, this did not disappoint.

We watched as it was taken back, tasted by the chef, who was repulsed by it too. our drinks were good and the steak was okay, but after recommending what i thought was one the best restaurants in brooklyn to several friends, it really did feel like a let down. no fault to the staff or the chefs but i don't know. im just... saddened by the whole experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/arden-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Granted it was 6:15 but the place fills up early as the outdoor seating is wonderful for people watching during after work / early dinner hours. The service was excellent from the waitress to the busboys. Food was milanese italian style. A bit pricey but great for a neighborhood joint. Nice cocktail list. Pace of food was properly spaced. After being in the hamptons in the summer where the service is terrible and full of pretentious assholes it was nice to be back in brooklyn with some more diversity and nice people.

Laila P.,/user_details?userid=X81HHthtJLBJA3viHK5gWg,"New York, NY",4/22/2022,1.0,"I'm going to be honest here and tell you that I'm not really going to talk about the food. It was alright. I'm not a food critic and I'm not going to pretend to be. Was it worth the over $300 it cost? Not really, in my opinion. The steak was overwhelmingly salty, the portions were small and highly priced, the meringue was mostly whipped cream and I actually have no idea what part of it was meringue but I digress. I've had meals I enjoyed more for considerably less, but then again, my taste is not yours, and I am not going to impress it upon you. What I am going to talk about is the fact that Saraghina is one of the most egregious examples of  gentrification I have seen yet. The air is infected with a sort of wealthy self importance that I have never found even in small amounts to be pleasant, and especially not in this case, where it permeates the very tile. I was even rushed out after my exceptionally overpriced meal and told to leave because ""there are people waiting for your spot."" I am every bit sympathetic to accommodating other people, but the complete lack of tact with which it was brought up was palpable, like a cloying, sickly sweet perfume worn by someone with a demeanor that expresses cleanly and plainly that they think you are not worth their time. There are many beautiful and unique restaurants across New York City that display the vast array of cultures and people that live here. This embarrassingly over-gilded ""upper crust"" establishment is as far as anything can be from what makes NYC special, and I urge you to support smaller local businesses across the city that both need and actually deserve your patronage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/saraghina-caff%C3%A8-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Hannah J.,/user_details?userid=v7yaJzY6E8h-zRbWXvbXtg,"Brooklyn, NY",5/2/2022,5.0,Kiki's is a special spot in the city. Love this gem and the food. I didn't get any pictures of the food because we absolutely devoured it but it is sooo tasty. It can be hard to get in but it seems to be a favorite of large groups. They have both sides of the street and the restaurant is unmarked other than the copious amounts of people spilling out onto the sidewalk and their doors being wide open for a glimpse inside. The tzatziki is to die for and the pita is so soft. I had the chicken with potatoes and the sauce really made the meal. The chicken also wasn't too dry. Inside there is a lot of energy and rustic decor.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The vegetables and feta tasted incredibly fresh. The fava, which was similar to hummus in its consistency, was delicious and creamy. The zucchini chips were fried and crisped to perfection, making it a perfect side dish that was difficult to stop eating. The shelled Sautéed Shrimp was well seasoned in a tasty creamy sauce.

We also got the Greek salad (horiatiki) which was fresh & delicious. We also enjoyed the octopus. The patates me agave were delicious and the eggs were perfectly cooked (not too runny). The honey mustard sauce with the fries was fabulous. For dinner, we have ordered the moussaka (eggplant, potatoes, & meat) & the lamb (amazing).

Maggie Z.,/user_details?userid=2-uP_Db0SeV721CBYdoZ3g,"Chicago, IL",11/19/2022,2.0,"The food was pretty bland and unseasoned. The grilled octopus was good in that it was tender, but we couldn't taste any other seasoning, only the lemon juice from what we squeezed. The portion of the octopus was also smaller than what was seen in the pictures, so I guess that's inflation for ya. We also ordered the pastichio plate and branzino. I didn't expect the pastichio to be sweet, and it tasted more like it was an apple pie, considering the cinnamon and brown sugar taste. The branzino was the highlight of the meal, but was still on the bland side. This dish came with a side of potatoes or rice, and we opted for the rice. This rice seemed to only rely on the sauce for flavoring, because it straight up tasted like tomato sauce. Additionally the service was flat out bad. The server never came up to us to ask how the food was, never asked if we needed anything else, and never came to refill our water. We were able to wave him down at the end, and even then he only asked if we were done and if he could take the plates away.

Vickie W.,/user_details?userid=v1wOhhRrjsQw6ppkkvk_Bg,"New York, NY",12/12/2020,5.0,"COVID-19 outdoor dining review: during the beginning of the pandemic, a friend and I got takeout from Kiki's (Greek salad, eggplant dip, and a side of fries) and ate everything with delight on a nearby bench. When they opened for outdoor dining this summer, I eagerly came back, and can report that this restaurant still knocks it out of the park. Getting a table both times I came for dinner was shockingly easy, even at prime time, as they have quite a few outdoor tables set up on the street. The setup feels very spacious, and they've been able to maintain the same cool but low-key vibe that made it so easy to while away hours here drinking their house wine and eating simple, excellent food. I've had most of the menu at this point, but faves are definitely the saganaki, moussaka, Greek salad, octopus, shrimp in the mustard-cider vinaigrette, avgolemono soup (pre-pandemic, I loved coming alone during the week and eating the soup + the octopus or shrimp with a book at the bar), roasted lemon potatoes, and my beloved cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'm no Greek connoisseur but we brought my Greek friend who said it was ""solid."" Guess he wasn't blown away, but I sure was. Especially at such a reasonable price point. Carafes of wine (1L) are ~$24! I highly recommend the saganaki if you like savory and sweet. The octopus is also great and lemony and so so tender. Also, tzaziki is crazy good and they bring charred breads/pita for dipping. Nice ambiance, like a dimly lit cavern in Europe.

Peggy C.,/user_details?userid=eRCQMWE2tNuN7hXKUUfymA,"Los Angeles, CA",2/11/2018,5.0,"Honestly, I don't normally even go for Greek food as my first choice, but on a recent trip to New York, Kiki's was by far the best meal I had and I LOVED it. It was just the perfect combination of great service, really fun atmosphere that made us feel like we had found something special, and fantastic food. My friend and I came in for dinner on a Sunday and luckily we managed to get seated immediately. Didn't have trouble finding the location - just be prepared to not be searching for a sign that says ""Kiki's"" (I'd suggest looking at photos of the exterior here on Yelp to help you). I love the decor, which is super charming - also, note to restaurants, the idea to stick a small shelf next to the table for condiments, silverware and the candle is so SO smart...more people got to do this! We ordered a spanikopita, whole branzino, moussaka, and the ekmek kataifi for dessert along with wine. All of the portions were massive but so good and hearty. The spanikopita was so good, the branzino was charred perfectly on the outside and moist on the inside. I've never had moussaka before, and I feel like it was similar to a shepard's pie (and delicious). We were so full we had trouble finishing the ekmek, but try we did since it was such a fun mix of flavors and textures. Our server was so lovely, and when he heard we were in town for a while, he quickly wrote down a list of other restaurants he recommended in the LES area. Just a crazy good experience all around, and I would definitely come again next trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

In any case, I found it and when we arrived on a Friday night close to 6:30PM, the place was quite empty. It did fill up as the night went on though. In any case, we were told to sit anywhere we'd like, so we did. I ordered the moussaka, and the food took a while to come out which was a good sign (or so I thought). My food was lukewarm, but the top of my moussaka was crunchy. I thought the balance of meat to potato to eggplant was not very good as there was way too much meat and not enough eggplant and potato. The flavor was just of beef which I guess is expected, and in general I thought it was just okay. Ambiance was alright but I could see the place being really dark if it were dark outside; since it was still light outside, this wasn't a problem. Service was acceptable as our waters were refilled appropriately, dishes were cleared when we were done, we were offered dessert, and we were given the check in at timely manner.

Their menu includes a lot of traditional greek items which sounds delicious. I was very close to ordering their octopus and a dessert but that would be way too much for me to eat during lunch.

I honestly don't get that freaked out my roaches (if it was a rodent, I would've been a lot more upset), but my friends were disgusted and squatted on their chairs.

We were told repeatedly when we called in that they don't take reservations for small groups. Fine, so we went early and got seated at a 4 person table for 5 people in our party. However, when a larger table opened up (seats 6), we asked the waiter if we could switch as it was hot and we have yet to get any of our food. Yet, we were told that the table is reserved (I thought no reservations?) and later, when the party showed up, it was 4 people (which they definitely could have sat at our table designed for 4). I'm not sure if they were just unwilling to accomodate our switch as they have already sat us or something didn't add up.

Rosie J.,/user_details?userid=514cnV0afo118Rut0ETc5w,"New York, NY",12/23/2017,3.0,i loved all the food but they're all small and pricey. i went in on a thursday night around 8pm. no wait. i was seated at the bar while a table was available. i ordered house wine which was not my taste so i would not recommend that. i started ordering the octopus. finished it very quickly because it was quite yummy and the dish was way too small. got seated and ordered the snapper. the snapper has a lot of meat but it also has a lot of bones if you're not into that. the potatoes that came along with this dish were literally 4 strips of potato wedges. i wasn't full so i ordered the meat dish which contained of 3 small beef patties and french fries. i enjoyed this dish more.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I already love Mediterranean food, but they do everything right. If you don't know where to start...get the octopus salad. It will change your life. Flavorful, grilled to perfection, and not dry in the least. I also got moussaka which was an explosion of delicious flavor. This had eggplant, potato, ground beef, and a healthy dollop of love.

We came on a Sunday night four girls and had to wait around 25 minutes. there was a line out the door but they said they'd call us when our table was ready. The wait was way less than she had indicated (45 min). The ambiance was extremely cute, almost cave like with 3 different sections of the restaurant and tables right in windows over the street. Aside from the ambiance, there was a lot left to be desired. We started out with the tzakziki, which was ok- probably the best thing. We then ordered what they said was like hummus, I think the fava dip. This was possibly the most disgusting hummus I've ever had. It was chalky and terrible tasting, no flavor. We also got the moussaka. This was also disgusting. It was smothered in some sort of cheese. We then got the octopus which was nothing special- straight octopus all minced up which was strange. The spanakopita was the only edible thing we ordered besides the tzakziki. Last we got the zucchini chips, which were way too fried for my liking. The service was slow we had to ask for help multiple times and the woman would not answer our questions about the menu. The only good thing was the wine- which was fairly inexpensive for a carafe (around 25).

Natasha B.,/user_details?userid=N8IJBENaNNEU4KoB4HYnVQ,"San Francisco, CA",3/21/2017,3.0,"I think this place is solid, I would say 3.5. It's got good energy, a lot of hip people, on a cool little street, it's lettering is Chinese to match the area and fast efficient service. The food is okay, at least what we had. The greek salad has all the makings of a great salad but I believe is prepared and therefore doesn't have the coolness and crunch that makes this salad perfect. It also needs more red wine vinegar. The feta and olives were good quality. Also the veggies are not cut quiet enough to mix them effectively. The grilled octopus tastes very good but definitely not fresh off the grilled, very moderately warmed, sitting out for some time temperature. The zuchinni chips are plentiful but are smushed together for some and not fried very crispy, I've usually had better. The mousakka was excellent. Nothing was at all wrong with this dish. The cheesecake was also very good but I'd like some fresh strawberries over the preserves. The wine tasted like I was in Greece again, it sent my senses whirling. They did card me which I took as a great compliment ;) I would prefer they were less timely/efficient and make my food fresh.

G T.,/user_details?userid=zVtIfa-2dBNunYWA36xLgA,"Manhattan, NY",4/29/2018,2.0,"I had the misfortune of having dinner here on a recent Saturday night at 6:30 PM.  The noise level was so high that the following day my throat was hoarse and my voice cracked. All of this just to try and have a conversation with the person sitting 20 inches away from me.  We sat at a table that was 20 inches wide so that my knees locked with the inner thighs of the person sitting across from me. There was a ceiling support pole directly in front of my face coming up through the table. We sat on high stools with no back so it was uncomfortable. They overstuffed the room with seats so there was no (and I do mean NO) room for the waiter to pass so each time the waiter went to another table he would have to ask patrons to move out of the way. The climate control system consisted of opening the door and windows to let in some fresh air and then closing them while the temperature rose to 86 degrees and then repeating the same cycle all over again until walking pneumonia set in.  I might have been willing to forgive all of the above had the food compensated for the apparent greed of the restaurant owner to put profit over palate. Not the case. The moussaka had a hard (and sometimes crunchy) thin béchamel layer when it should have featured a 2"" tall soft silkiness. It had pieces of meat instead of being ground as the traditional dish calls for.  Missing was a rich multilayered flavor profile because the seasoning was woefully underdeveloped and revealed a chef who obviously had no formal training in cooking.  That was no more evident than in the disappointing spanakopita (spinach pie) which lacked the expected dill, lemon, and tangy feta cheese flavors that should have made it an easy crowd pleaser.  The lamb chops were unremarkable and lacked seasoning.  How much could a little fresh oregano, basil or mint cost?  The pureed fava beans were unidentifiable in taste and texture and more suited to an infant's diet. The grilled octopus lacked a smoky flavor component to its skin and was obviously not marinated and prepped with fresh herbs prior to being grilled. The tzatziki was a missed opportunity to exhibit a balanced blend of garlic and dill. Instead it was a contrast between the bland and the blander.  The saganaki (fried cheese) appetizer was an abomination. It is supposed to be served flambe with warmed brandy instead it was just broiled. The ""cheese"" must have been a cheap knockoff because it lacked the strong flavor that the dish should command. How could they destroy fried cheese you may ask?  By placing it on a puddle of sweet honey.  Not even Winnie-the-Pooh would have liked it. The honey is unprecedented, unjustifiable and inexcusable. Saganaki is not intended as a dessert. The signature greek dessert, baklava, was underwhelming and unsubstantial in taste and portion size which in a way was a blessing to have less to suffer through. The galaktoboureko (semolina custard dessert in filo) dessert would have been fine had it not displayed a strong sour citrus flavor which made me wonder if it had gone bad.  Thankfully it was fresh and only the baker was bad.  On a positive note the fried zucchini chips with grated cheese were good but not good enough to redeem the multiple assaults to my mouth, body, eyes, and ears.  Perhaps this place may satisfy the uninitiated who may never have eaten at an authentic greek restaurant before and understandably have nothing better to compare it to. The owner may think doing something different is in good taste. But it just tastes bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Stefanos P.,/user_details?userid=BKNysd4omftTNjrHZTPswA,"Elmhurst, NY",6/15/2015,5.0,"Ok...lets start with this first...I was born and raised in Greece and lived there for 28 years which means i pretty familiar with what the real Greek food is.  So after being almost three years in New York finally we found Kiki's place which has 100% Greek recipes and the the food its really tasteful which makes u travel to Greece for a moment. We had mousaka, grilled octopus, greek salad,tirokauteri, ntakos salad, bifteki, saganaki cheese and pasta with shrimps...all of them were just perfect. I have been to many Greek restaurants and by far i believe that the place is the best. Traditional Greek food with a very cute and cozy environment...the staff are so welcome and the noise level is low which is a big plus for a restaurant in NY especially for those who want to enjoy their food in a quiet environment. And the prices are just unbelievable compared with the quantity and the quality of the food. So if u want a really good traditional restaurant here is the one...i will definitely go back. Cozy, friendly, nice music, quiet environment, excellent food, good prices.

Only decent thing is the eggplant appetizer. The fact they have no menu online and the idiotic attempt to make the place unique by saying greek food or whatever in chinese characters also makes the place hard to even find. When you go in you are served soda in mason jars which is annoying because there is nothing greek about that. Right now its crowded and popular but the novelty will die down for sure. By the way I only make mention of the hipster atmosphere because going there in general for anyone else ............you will not feel comfortable eating your meal. There is nothing about that warm greek hospitality and pride in their food about this place.

The corn tortillas, meat, chopped cilantro, diced onions, sliced pineapple,and guacamole tasted extremely fresh. Everything is made fresh to order. My favorite item was the chicken quesadillas on flour tortilla. The flour tortilla was perfectly thin and layered with an equally thin coating of cheese.

Very small menu, the pork being my favorite over the carne. The Quesadilla seems to be a larger taco, open and easier to eat standing... I'd recommend that to start with, choose either flour or corn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Come for the tacos-if you're a purist then don't get the works (salsa & guacamole at no extra cost) but getting everything is pretty darn good. You get a choice of corn of flour tortilla: get the corn. And ask for lime: you'll get a little bag filled with lime, chilies, and radish at no extra cost.

Plus an actual food menu (but I was too distracted by sugar to even look at the food menu). So much to choose from. I pretty much bought all that could fit into 2 boxes, because this is what a vegan does when trying a new vegan establishment for the first time. it's 50% curiosity and 50% wanting to support a new vegan business. Well, my charitable ways paid off. Le Petit Monstre blows all other vegan croissants and cronuts away. I had the pistachio, hazelnut, and regular croissants. Pain au chocolat, raspberry cronut. Cruffin with lime custard (?), two types of fruit tarts, a vanilla mille-feuille, and a linzer tart. Everything deserves a million starts. But maybe only half a million stars for the vanilla mille-feuille. I'm too used to the vegan one at Laduree (sorry to mention another bakery, especially not an all-vegan one, but their vegan mille-feuille is excellent). I have already been raving about this bakery to so many vegan friends. Will be back many times! P.S. The actual space is beautiful. This isn't a hole in the wall.

Jacqueline P.,/user_details?userid=Gk39GuCR0JRVQt5v53Z9CQ,"New York, NY",3/26/2023,2.0,Very disappointed by my last visit here this past weekend. This used to be a go-to spot of mine but it's gone downhill. I came here for brunch and it was a very subpar experience. We waited over an hour for our food and the order was almost entirely incorrect. They forgot our appetizer on top of delivering entrees with missing ingredients. The chicken breast salad used to be great but it came out greasy with wilted lettuce. The waiter was very apologetic and even comp'd one of the entrees but the experience was already ruined at that point. Hopefully they can address the issues and improve accordingly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The coffee was pretty pricey but was unlimited so can't complain too much. We both ordered the broccoli scramble and a side of cheese grits. The scramble was delicious! So creamy and perfectly cooked. It also came with a biscuit. I have high standards for biscuits and have been on the search for a good one in NYC. This one was decent. I didn't like the jam they had very much. The biscuit had a good taste but wasn't very flaky. The cheese grits were awesome! I don't think I've ever had any like that before.

The apple compote for spreading on the bread was delicious, and the bread was in thick slices so I was satisfied. The soup was creamier than I thought, but it tasted good and I loved the parsnip. The flavors in each of the dishes were clearly well thought out, and I appreciate the expertise and art that went into planning and cooking these dishes.

It was a bit too loud - we sat in the outdoor section, partitioned off from others by sheets of plexi. Luckily I sat in the middle so I could hear everyone but people on the ends could only hear those beside them (and across - but not even that that well). We shared a couple of bottles of wine, cocktails (love their tequila cocktails), their foccacia bread with cheese dip (generous portions), seafood ceviche (great), radishes (great) burrata/toast, a fish entree (great), roast chicken (great), and 2 desserts (the rhubarb one was great as was the chocolate). I'd go back but hopefully with a different seating arrangement so it's not so loud and hard to hear others.

Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. The one tip I have is definitely make reservations unless you want to wait forever to  and if you do then you do you lol. It's easy to make reservations on Resy but make sure to do so at least a couple days in advance. I managed to get a reservation at noon for Sunday a couple days beforehand. This place is super cute and homely inside, loved that and the open kitchen as well. For drinks I ordered the Old Fashioned while my friend opted for the Bloody Mary. Both drinks were nice and strong. As we both have a sweet tooth, for entrees I got the ""Dutch Baby"" and my friend got the Almond Pancakes.  I can't speak for the pancakes (though they looked really good) but the ""Dutch Baby"" was very good. I kind of just wish it was more fluffy but I think it's just how it's cooked...I don't know anything about cooking.

My girlfriend made reso's a week before hand for a table of 5 and we were guaranteed a table yet we still had to wait 25 mins for our table. The waiting area was extremely busy and it was situated next to the bar. The restaurant itself looked super nice and I loved their design and aesthetic. The food on the other hand, pretty standard overpriced brunch place. Nothing amazing stood out. I ordered the Egg + Sausage Sandwich with their hash (mainly for their hash) which actually came out to be a burger. The hash I thought tasted similar to the ones you can get at any Eggsmart but just more wet. I wasn't impressed. My boyfriend ordered the Huevos Rancheros - which I had looked up on yelp to see that it was highly recommended. It was alright as well, tasted like tortilla chips with salsa and you decided to throw in an egg and called it 'brunch'. The rest of my friends ordered the Poached Eggs, Simple Oven Baked Eggs, and Falafel. A side of Hash for the entire table. I wasn't really blown away with anything and their were they. Their Caesars looked very dressed up though.

Danielle S.,/user_details?userid=IQrzYHuO2yxuwdrgDOXI1Q,"New York, NY",2/2/2020,3.0,Ate here Saturday night as a group of 4 and wish I could have given it 5 stars! We had a reservation for 7pm but they still had us wait almost 15 minutes. The portions are small and prices high. We had the deviled eggs and burrata to start. They were both very tasty but gone within a few bites. We asked the waitress to bring bread 3 times and we never got it! It also took a ridiculously long time for us to get our entrees which was annoying. I heard great things for brunch but was underwhelmed with their dinner experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We had no problem exchanging one of our cheese to a different one once we saw that it's blue cheese which none of us eat. The mussels were very fresh and done just right. Great tasting toast we were given. Asked for more bread, got the focaccia.  Yum.  I got the Bordetto for entree.  A little on the spicy side but that's just personal preference. The sirloin steak my cousin had looked good. Porkchop was very tender and flavorful too. The crispy potato was sooo crispy. Wow.  And that's from someone who doesn't normally eat potato. (I didn't eat any of the finger potatoes in the Bordetto. Again, I just don't really eat potatoes,  that's all me).  So you can imagine how good the crispy potatoes were.

We had the deviled eggs, buratta, chicken liver pate, Brussel sprouts, persimmon salad, roasted chicken and roasted sunchokes. Everything we had was pretty solid but the stand outs were the buratta, chicken liver pate and the roasted chicken. The service was good and friendly but got a little slow but the end of the night. All things considered we had a great time, it's a really fun environment with a great vibe. We will come back again for sure!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We went on a Saturday at around 2 and was told that there was 25-30 mins wait. We put down our numbers for a text when our table was ready and walked around the neighborhood.  The wait time wasn't too bad, though it was way past brunch time.  When we got the text and went into the restaurant, we got seated right away. Our server came and offered complimentary still/sparking water, gave us time for the menu, took our order, etc. Though the staff were all very nice, and our server was definitely attentive. They made sure to always topped off our coffee, brought us plates and knife for us to share the deviled eggs, then reset the entire table for our brunch food.  The space was very airy and nice, it had a very good atmosphere to it. The price was reasonably and we really liked our brunch food.

I've always told friends ""this is my favorite restaurant in NYC"" and last night Cookshop again proved why. On a busy Saturday night, they welcomed my husband and I with our stroller and 4 month old with open arms. It was our first night out as a family for dinner and the hostess was beyond accommodating, seating us at a spacious 4-top to make room for the stroller to be table side. After enjoying the Brussels, deviled eggs and pork croquettes we followed that with meat loaf and the cornmeal dusted skate. After those courses with wine and cocktails they staff lovingly sent over 2 glasses of champagne as congratulations for making our first night out with baby! I can't express how that simple gesture truly was the icing on top of an already incredible experience.

Nothing really struck our fancy in the area, but Cookshop came up as a well rated breakfast and brunch place so we decided to check it out. I think when we got there they had just opened, but even so it was still super busy. We got the last 4 seat table that was available, and sat down and ordered. Among the four of us, we got the baked eggs with toast, the Huevos Rancheros, the quiche/frittata, and the eggs and bacon basic breakfast with a couple of coffees. The decor of Cookshop is very grand, very all-American breakfast kind of place with flowers and wood paneling on the walls, and with pets/dogs allowed inside the store (we had a French at the table next to us!). The food was just alright, not the best brunch I've had but it was definitely quality food. For the price point in Chelsea, it was a fair amount of food. I was less than impressed by my Huevos Rancheros, but the baked eggs were pretty good (could've been spicier, given how it looked it wasn't spicy at all!). Overall, solid brunch place (not super conducive to conversation unfortunately because it's pretty loud), but the alcoholic brunch drinks looked good!

Everyone was pleased with their drink selections, but I liked the cider the best, which was good b/c that is the one I got. I had the broccoli and caramelized onion frittata which came with a biscuit and a side of greens. The biscuit was huge and was served with apple butter (nomnomnom.) The frittata was warm, cheesy, and well-portioned. After inhaling the entire thing, I was definitely full but not too full.

I got the crumbled cranberry and it was super sour. If you are a fan of sour drink then I would recommend you getting it. For my entree, I got the gingerbread pancake. It was ok. I prefer the French toast more. My friend got the jueveous rancheros, it has a lot of bean and a little spicy.

Lauren S.,/user_details?userid=9vukTWSQFaw__hRWe3UVNA,"Orange, CA",9/9/2019,5.0,"Cookshop is what I'd consider a Chelsea brunch monument... Excellent creative food that makes both young and old happy. Only downside is so many hotels have now shared this so much that it can often flood with tourists, which makes it hard for us locals to get a table (sounds like a good problem to me as they're doing many things right)! I brought a friend here from out of town and she loved it (I've been many times where I've sat at the bar, inside table, as well as dined outside). If you haven't been to Cookshop, I highly suggest it but recommend you get there early with your entire party to ensure you're able to snag a table (you can put your name in w/the hostess & enjoy their fabulous craft cocktails at the bar while you wait - it's worth it). The Margarita Refresher is fantastic (refreshing like its fitting name), the deviled eggs are so tasty for a light bite, and then that Dutch baby on the skillet is truly next level goodness!!

We loved it!  It was packed with a wait so we sat at the bar surrounded by locals all ordering different varieties of Bloody Mary's. We jumped right on the bandwagon and had one too. So great!  Our food was superb...a definite must go back! Great food! Great drinks! Great service!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Achiaa P.,/user_details?userid=6RhRgFFzzDOQPXdYqhOxPQ,"New York, NY",10/13/2016,4.0,"Came in for brunch on Sunday. To start off, we got a Dutch apple and mint pancake for the table. I love as extremely disappointed with it because it was much smaller than it looks in pictures; you can probably finish the entire thing in 6 bites. The pancake was not as thick as expected and it was almost soggy since it was soaking in the apple sauce. It came with syrup which wasn't really needed for the dish as the apple had its own syrup. Next I got the fried egg sandwich while my sister got the sautéed spinach and cheddar scramble. The fried egg sandwich came with a jalapeño cabbage slaw which I got on the side and was happy with my decision since it had a very strong acidic flavor. I loved the house made sausage, it was seasoned to perfection and went well with the egg. The hash brown was to die for, also seasoned very well . Overall I'd say this was. 9/10 meal. I had some of the sautéed spinach and cheddar scramble which I liked very much. The highlight of both meals was the buttermilk biscuit. It was a big portion and tasted delicious. Perfectly doughy but had the perfect crumble. The cheddar scramble was also delicious. So as a tip I would go with their baked options for an appetizer just based off the biscuit. We had a really great waiter who gave us complimentary beignets for dessert. The beignets weren't the best ever but they weren't bad either.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I cannot say this is a normal experience and maybe was because everyone was out watching manhattanhenge (which does not thrill me by the way). The food was great, but if I could do it again I would have made a real effort to split everything with my fellow diner. I got cabbage as an appetizer, which was too spicy for my mom but I thought was delightful. For an entree I got ricotta lasagna which was really good but a bit heavy. I only made it through half the skillet before I tapped out :(. I was however impressed by how much of the menu was vegetarian friendly.

The service is ok, not working up to full potential. We waited awhile for an iced tea and lemonade , actually came with the main meal. When they pour the water there is no ice, I am sure if I asked it would have come but I didn't realize the iced tea would take so long. I had huevos rancheros and once again truly enjoyed the selection. The flavors pull together the right amount of spice and the beans are cooked to an appropriate texture.  If you want to try trendy this is a good choice, but speak up is the type of service to prepare for when you dine.  Also the hostess is not much in welcoming you and other guests noted, not sure if pretentious is part of the allure for some patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My bestie and I decided we wanted to try multiple things so we got the Fried Egg Sandwich (we got it scrambled style) and the 'Dutch Baby' Skillet-Baked Pancake. What can I say! The brioche bun on that sandwich was so soft and pillow-like that I hated that I decided to share it. I mean you really can screwup an egg sandwich so it was pretty good. Now on to that Dutch Baby! I think it saw Jesus when I ate that bite cause it just melted in my house. It came in its little skillet nice and hot with that walnut compote was just magical.

Bob G.,/user_details?userid=xFxkiR6mHrE27RO9jd-GJQ,"JAMAICA, NY",7/1/2018,4.0,"Returned to Cookshop on a Saturday evening. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. This is a big, loud venue with a lot of ""electricity"" in the air. It's not a place for quiet conversation but it is a place to enjoy creative cuisine by an exceptional chef. Our server was attentive throughout the meal. Our appetizers were the Squash Blossom Picatta with anchovy, lemon, pecorino cheese, capers, and garlic and the Sungold tomatoes with tri-star strawberries and purple basil. The Squash Blosson Picatta didn't look anything like the description but was wonderful. The Sungold tomatoes was an attempt at creativity that missed. Somehow, Tomatoes and strawberries just didn't work. It was pleasant but in the past I had a cold Sungold Tomato soup that was far better and I wished it was on the menu the night I dined here. Our entrees were the Pan roasted hallibut with marinated cucumbers, tarragon vinaigrette, and herb salad and the Montauk Porgy with black olive tapanade, cumin, lemon, and fava bean salad,  Both were excellent. Dessert was the Rhubarb pie with almond cream, oat crumb and buttermilk ice cream and the Basil Sorbet. The Rhubarb pie was great.  For me, Chef JoJo forever will own the best Basil Sorbet, and this sorbet, while creamy, seemed too sweet. It was good however. I skipped coffee since on previous visits the coffee was mediocre. The one thing I have to say. We dined on a night when the outside temperature was over 90. Several of the staff were wearing strong cologne that was really unpleasant and overwhelming when they approached the tables. It would be appreciative if the staff could wear more subtle cologne while waiting the tables. Apart from this, another great dining experience at Cookshop. And it was nice to have the owner bid us ""farewell"" after our meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered the Grilled Carolina shrimp salad w/ fingerling potatoes, capers, olives and dijon vinaigrette. First of all shrimp and potatoes are just not a good match. I should have known and I guess the chef should have known. But the crime was the shrimps themselves. Having that unmistakable acetoney flavor that seafood take on when past its prime. The salad was overdressed and the greens severely melted. The dressing was too salty, add the capers and the olives - to the point of inedible. I had really high hopes this place was capable of making an outstanding salad. My mainstay. It's so easy guys. You just need fresh ingredients, minimal experience, then toss. My husband ordered the crispy fish sandwich which was superb. The wine was great as usual and the former governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson was dining on the next table over, which naturally led to reminiscing about those happy days. Lunch is very busy here and it seemed the staff was a bit overwhelmed. It was hard to get their attention. Don't you want to sell more wine?

This time, I went for a sweet choice and got the Cornmeal Pancakes with lemon and Pomegranate seeds, and enjoyed every bite. I also find that the prices are pretty reasonable for the portion of the meals and for the overall exceptional experience! If you come for brunch on the weekend, I recommend getting there right when it opens, so that you will get a table right away. When we left around 11:30 am, there was a long line waiting for a table.

Especially to start my day off after a night of drinking haha ... my friend ordered the Brooklyn Russian ($13) and that was more of what I should have ordered - an alcoholic coffee drink.  Anyways, I ordered the Friend Egg Sandwich ($13) and that was so good!  The potato hash was spicy - it had some spicy oil all over but it was delicious.  The sandwich itself was a bit oily, maybe from the fried egg topped over an Italian sausage patty, but it was great hangover food.  My friend ordered the Huevos Rancheros, and it looked really good, but all it really was was beans with three baked eggs on top for $17 - a little too expensive for what it was.  A good brunch spot to try, but I'm sure there are a bunch of others in the area that won't have you waiting forever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There were a few things I was looking at but decided on the baked eggs, my friend had the egg sandwich. Wishing I was there for the egg breakfast pizza! We sat outside, people watched, there was a wait (about 20 min) but its saturday brunch in ny... Orange juice and coffee... $10 total, so just be aware of ny pricing there. Manager/owner was walking around, chatting with us (nice touch). My eggs were perfect, so was the pancetta, and the raisin toast (great hangover cure). My friend wasnt feeling so hot so I dug into her siracha sweet potatoes as the side for her egg sandwich.. Very good and unique. $13 for my eggs, felt that was fair.

The chicken was noisy and not over cooked. Though it may have been a slight too salty for my taste, it was still delicious.

Our waitress Nikki was amazing at describing the various dishes, but also readily volunteered her favorites to guide our decisions. We asked for the fried okra and cauliflower fritters, and she suggested the peppers. All 3 were excellent!  For entrees we had the spit roasted chicken (2), sea scallops (2), mixed grill and pork chop.  Everything was delicious. The berries served with the pork chop and the marinated vegetables with the chicken made each of those entrees so special. The sea scallops were devoured so quickly that I can't share any details!  The desserts were great too.

We had to wait for about 30 minutes which is fine because you can actually get a drink in the bar and then wait outside for them which is kind of nice. My date and I we're taking it easy on a Sunday morning drinking mimosas, just enjoying the nice weather outside while we were already seated at the table. Then the waiter started getting weird and pushy about wanting us to order. After the second time he asked if we were ready to order and we told him that we were just taking it easy, he called the manager and the manager asked us if we could order because they were full capacity (!!!). So, food is ok, bar is ok, but they clearly don't give a damn about treating their customers appropriately.

The wait was almost an hour long and we were starving so we decided to park it at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and super patient so I enjoyed their company. What I wasn't a huge fan of was the food. It was okay. We started with the french toast which was very soggy on the bottom and I ordered the lobster roll as my main course. The only thing that was good about that dish was the chips.. Oh.. They were fantastic. The lobster tasted like eggs and the bartender said that it was maybe the bread and I picked up just a piece of the lobster on its own and I still tasted egg. I later ordered a chicken cesear salad which the kitchen graciously made for me because it wasn't on the brunch menu. The chicken was so tender and juicy and just LIFE! I love it!!

(It's always packed so expect a long wait without reservations.)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's hard to snag a weekend reservation: do it six weeks in advance if you want a prime time (anytime between 11-2). The Bloody Marys are superb (get one with ramps in the spring). The pastry board (with assorted scones, beignets, etc.)  could be a meal in itself. The coffee is smooth and rich (my guess is La Colombe). Cookshop's renditions of the classics (frittata, huevos rancheros, scramble, and French toast) are all done to perfection, with seasonal ingredients. The room is also really spacious with well-spaced tables. No need to scream to be heard. No risk of having to listen to your neighbors' annoying conversations.

While the items that we ordered sounded like they would be delicious (huevos rancheros, shakshuka, chicken liver mousse, sweet potato bread), they were mediocre in execution. The huevos rancheros and shakshuka were bland compared to renditions I've had elsewhere, and the crackers that came with the chicken liver mousse had seasoning that overpowered the rest of the dish. The pickles served with the mousse were also unappetizing. As for the sweet potato bread, I could've made better at home.

Alex M.,/user_details?userid=DSsdcb_V5QIOXwFNcQC2VA,"New York, NY",6/4/2017,5.0,"Super casual place with absolutely AMAZING FOOD. I went there to meet my friends that told me before how great this place is. We were a group of 6 and we ordered bunch of plates to share, so I had the chance to try out half if not more of the menu and OMG...  from the first bite to the last every single dish was just incredible, and let me tell you with the amount of food we had on the table that almost never happens. Just a few of my favorites to count: the chicken wings - soo tender and flavorful, the meat just falls apart from the bone just by a touch of your fork; caesar salad - they make it with Lacinato Kale and most delicious caesar dressing ever;  whole trout - I was extremely skeptical about it I've had quite a few fishy experiences with trout but this one was to die for; roasted chicken - so tender and juicy; fried skate - do not get fooled by the fried part because the fish would melt in you mouth like butter; pork chop - had a nice preparation with rhubarb and strawberries very tasty. And we finished with some donuts and orange ice cream .... Everything is so fresh and tasty,  farm to table, even the garnishes of each dish we terrific and you can tell the chef pours his love in to the food because you can feel it with each bite you take. The whole experience was magnified by their staff. The waitress was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu and Richard  the manager or/and the somm took such a good care of us with a brilliant wine recommendation and just most welcoming and friendly attitude. The atmosphere of this place is radiating good vibes and you walk out a happy clam planning on your next visit.

The staff said that our wait would be about 45 minutes but it ended up being an hour and a half. However, they gave us tasty cheddar cornbread and a muffin as an apology, which was nice. My friend and I split the huevos rancheros and the pancakes. The huevos rancheros was good for the first few bites, but then I discovered how watery it was at the bottom. Either they didn't drain the beans well or something, but it made everything really soggy. The raspberry pancakes with lemon curd was absolutely amazing on the other hand.

We also had the stracciatella cheese for $14, but what cheese on bread isn't? the balsamic was a bit overpowering. Nothing new here. The chicken liver mousse was fine. I had the cassoulet for dinner which included one kick ass sausage, which I promptly ate, but the beef belly and beans were too much, so I took it home, and honestly it was better the next day, heated up in the microwave than when served in the restaurant.

Cocktails were tasty, but nothing you couldn't find anywhere else in Chelsea. Dessert was the only saving grace. Loved the eggnog ice cream, and the zeppole alone get a star-def worth the calories.

I ordered the watermelon mojito as my cocktail and I must say not only was it delicious, it was also hella strong! For our entree, both my friend and I ordered the huevos rancheros with a side of bacon and a biscuit (sides were to split.) The huevos rancheros was DELICIOUS! Probably the best I've ever had. I was definitely part of the clean plate club with this dish. The biscuit was also top notch...the jelly? AH-MAZING! The bacon...was....not good at all. It was overcooked, burnt and extra, extra, extra CRISPY. I love me some bacon and I wasn't even able to eat it. No bueno. Aside from the bacon, the seating is crazy close. I get it, they want to fit as many people in this bad boy as possible. You kind of feel like you're on top of each other. The service was great!

Fresh,cooked to perfection and flavors that you need to experience the food blew us away and then they had the nerve to bring over these mini donuts that pushed us over the edge. There was an amazing green salad on the table, a fresh burrata that melted in your mouth, main course - chicken dish you haven't tasted a chicken like this  so moist and a flavor profile any chicken dish before this  doesn't count anymore, a lamb burger that was f@&ken outstanding and a Steak that was better please don't repeat this better than most Steak houses. We sat outside because the place was jam packed for good reason and we had a wonderful late dinner. We had fun enjoying everything! I even ordered an espresso at the end of the meal that can ruin everything at most restaurants but it was perfect and closed the deal that this is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC that I would recommend to everyone who loves food , good wine ,nice friendly service and the price was less then I expected but don't tell the owners that - Amazing dinner great waiter that gave perfect recommendations !!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The olives app was big enough to split between 10 people I think. The dinners were a bit disappointing. Some of the flavor combinations were strange in the steak dinner. The chicken was very hard to eat and although the swordfish was good it was the only thing that didn't come with a side, and it was then too late to order sides. The homemade ice cream was great!

I ordered the watermelon mojito, which was incredibly delicious and refreshing and the lasagnetti pasta with pesto, which was to die for. For dessert I ordered the nectarine shortcake, which was very fresh and just the right amount of sweet. The great thing about Cookshop is that the dishes are not overly complex because they get the best ingredients and they trust the ingredients enough to make them the star of the dish. You can really taste the freshness. i thought the price was fair for the quality I was getting. Also, the staff is incredibly nice and, even though the job didn't pan out for me, I have to say the management is awesome and super dedicated.

Krutika D.,/user_details?userid=VqMfGzsjbRICgzIZob4ZOQ,"San Francisco, CA",7/4/2014,5.0,"I went to brunch today and it was my cousin's first trip to NYC. So, with the weather pretty awful, the only way we could turn it around was order Bloody Mary's right when we walked in. We both got the Pickled Mary, which is their Bloody Mary house-blend with pickle juice and yummy garnishes. As a Bloody Mary virgin, I have to say I popped my cherry at the right spot. This mix hit the spot! Then we ordered hummus with seedless cucumber, sugar snap pease with chile oil and feta. The hummus came with flatter-than average pita bread that was so hot and steamy it paired well with the creamy and soft-toned hummus. The cucumber was fresh and crunchy as a topping. We also ordered the huevos rancheros, three eggs cooked with black beans, ranchero sauce, cheese, line crema fraiche, and pickled onions and jalapeños. It was out if this world! The chips paired with the creamy eggs and beans, sour from the onions and fresh sour cream made for the perfect brunch dish.

I noticed other table came in after us already got their drinks and been severed, but our table still empty. Fine finally our waitress showed up and she took the drinks and orders, when I told her that I might need few mins to go over the menu and choose my meal she looks very surprise, feel like she is sending me sore signal that I should be ready when she is talking the order. That's ok she left and after 10 mins someone just brought water to the table then after a while drinks arrived but not from our waitress instead someone else. I still haven't order yet and I was waiting when she come back but it's takes forever. I could have just wait on the table by myself. As I said, other table already finishing up we are just on the half way. Our waitress never come by to check on us but meanwhile she was very busy serving other tables.

Sam W.,/user_details?userid=OV5tDVT7N-0iogOaS9n5AA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/8/2017,4.0,"I was ready to tear this place up in a review as I initially had the most horrific experience, until  met the most gracious hostess, Sarah. I came in this morning for brunch and we were a party of 6 without reservations so I knew there'd be a wait. We waited at the bar until our party was called. Unfortunately, that wasn't for a quite a while and as I have two small children under the age of 3, we kept checking in with the host stand. Within 45 minutes we were still not seated and we had a manager sent over to us to talk to us about seating. It was the most bland and impersonal exchange I've ever experienced in an establishment. The manager spouted things that most managers would say and it all felt forced and impersonal. And then a few minutes into sitting at the bar, my 2 year old accidentally swung her arm over to the person sitting next to us and she gave us the dirtiest look and scoffed at our entire party. It's safe to say that the people that come here are entitled assholes that have no regard for anyone that has a complete family. This entire encounter made me feel so enraged and gripped with tears that I had to pardon myself outside (in the rain) where I shed a few tears for how horrific the people in this establishment were being toward our family. I then pulled myself together and came back inside to inquire about our wait time. The hostess told us it might be an additional 30 minutes considering our party size. I then broke back down in tears and told her of the horrific experience I had encountered at the bar and how defeated I had felt that day. No doubt this poor girl had a million people in the lobby trying to get in but she stepped away from her hostess podium, stepped down to the stroller level, held my hand and said: ""I understand how you feel and I'd really like you to stay, but it goes against every fiber of my being to ask you to stay anywhere you feel your family has been disrespected."" It was quite possibly the most genuine thing anyone has ever said and also quite possibly the most perfect thing a hostess could have said to me in that moment. From then, I would have agreed to wait another 5 hours. She then had a position set outside for us almost immediately and checked back in on us as she as leaving (turns out she's a resident physician, so her compassionate bedside manner comes as no surprise.) The food was good, the service was good, but the genuine kindness displayed in that moment of weakness by Sarah was priceless. It's quite rare to find someone as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside. I tried to find a manager before we left to tell us how welcome she made us feel but was bombarded by the crowd in the front. I'm always touched by these acts of genuine kindness and wanted to write my first Yelp review about it. Thank you for making my day. Cookshop, you have a gem of a hostess.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was hard to get a reservation - a lot of prime times are blocked off on the Open Table profile of this place - and finally I just called up the restaurant and got a reservation for two on a Friday night at 8:30pm. We arrived on a rainy evening with enough fog to make it difficult to see the stacked parking lot right across the street from the restaurant. The atrium area was PACKED with people waiting three-deep at the bar and pushing up against the door. So, we waited about an hour for our table (although we had a reservation) and as a way to make up for the inconvenience, our waiter gave us two free ""snacks"": fried spiced hominy and baby felafels with yogurt sauce. The spiced hominy was AMAZING and I completely stuffed myself on it as my friend that I was with doesn't eat fried foods (all the more for me!). We shared a great duck entree and the suckling pig.

laura d.,/user_details?userid=c9Pd6fK8IVk00SbMF9bI7w,"New York, NY",5/7/2007,4.0,Went here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Fairly difficult to get a good reservation time - we booked a week in advance and still couldn't get a table until 2:00. But that actually made me more excited because a restaurant on 10th avenue and 20th isn't busy because of the environment. We asked for a seat outside and the hostess was very kind to us. After we had a bloody mary at the bar she ushered us out to our seat - they were very accommodating to us. When our food took a little long to be delivered (although we didn't notice until the waitress mentioned it) we were given two complimentary bloody mary's. I ordered the scrambled egg on rye toast (not a fan of biscuits) and my boyfriend ordered the poached egg dish. The fact that he had no complaints about his food is huge.

Once you walk in you are greeted and seated immediately (if you have a reservation, luckily we did). They start you off with an assortment of bread with there special horse radish butter. To start off the meal I chose an appetizer which was there Little neck clams cooked in white wine with hand made pork chorizo with cilantro and lime. I'm a big fan of cilantro and that immediately caught my eye. It was refreshing... The dish was served in a cast-iron bowl. clams still in tact with the shell lay on the sliced chorizos that are bathing in the white wine sauce. Just squeeze the lime and provided and your ready to go. From the first bite I knew that the entire meal will be all good like this. For my main course I got the Hudson Valley duck breast Wehani. It came with a wild rice salad with red and black currant compote.... This dish had to be the best i've had so far in New York. All the elements came together and was not over powering. The duck was cooked with a little bit of red in pink in the center and it was very moist and juicy. The portions were very good. You can share with a friend and pass the plate around. I was very happy and pleased with my meal at The Cookshop. The price range is a little high, about $30-45 per person. I assure you that it is WORTH IT.

We were more than ready to order by that time, but he put the beers on the table and disappeared for the next 30 minutes.Then he showed up with a young lady and told us that she will be serving us. She took our orders - both vegetarian - which normally don't require long preparations. After almost 50 minutes we got the food. during this time we were wondering if the waitress gave our food to someone else by mistake, as she never showed up to give us an update, neither to ask us if we needed more water, beer, or anything at all so we could handle the long wait. The food was good, creative dishes, nice presentation. But quite frankly, 2 eggs on top of 4 pieces of tomato and burrata salad was not fulfilling, it shouldn't have been $18 and it definitely shouldn't have taken 50 minutes to make it. But certainly the lack of service topped it all. We left hungry, thirsty and disappointed for wasting almost 2 hours. And while many people say in their reviews the service is not there, I am puzzled how this place got high reviews and is still standing at all.

This place gets slammed with the brunch crowd, the business dinner crowd, the business lunch crowd, the neighborhood crowd, the scenesters, the B & T weekend shoppers/gallery types, everybody at one point so it's a wonder the kitchen hasn't burned down from trying to churn out the volume.  Yes, they try to serve locally sourced food. Yes, the people at the reservation desk are a bit jacked, and it's not unusual to wait 10 minutes in line to talk to someone about a table or a reservation you had. The food used to be better... some side dish/snack things like the spiced hominy were too salty, other things, a bit bland.  But the fish is always fresh and cooked very well all year round, the pork, sweet and smoky, and the pastas are done right. The wait staff is good. The menus are seasonal.  If you can get past the noise, and risk dining in close proximity to networking people, it's not bad, especially if you do the sidewalk seating and can gaze out at the people walking their well-groomed Chelsea dogs if the scene gets too annoying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

J C.,/user_details?userid=5DpLOTwGEHwGqZrtyqotFA,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",9/1/2009,3.0,"Until recently, I had visited Cookshop for lunch only and by and large enjoyed the food (dandelion salad, fish) and appreciated the efficient and pleasant service, all of which would deserve 4 stars. For a recent dinner, though, it was another story: the service was as good as ever, but the food was not. An appetizer of squid, bacon and beans was drained in grease, the squid somewhat flavorful (thanks to the bacon), but otherwise not a particularly appealing sight or taste. The main course of three parts of lamb was worse. The chop was both greasy (even for lamb) and overcooked. The shoulder was also overcooked but more palatable. The sausage was boring. All this, again, was swimming in what on the menu sounded like a good complement to the lamb. The reality was a messy mix of raita, chickpeas and way overcooked rapini. The nearly 40 minutes between appetizer and entree may explain the problem with the main course (had it been sitting under a heater?). The dessert (plum and almond tart) was fine, but not life-changing. To be fair, my dinner partner had the vegetable lasagna and enjoyed it, so perhaps my choices were poor, and it is worth another try for dinner, but at best it is hit and miss.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Each dish had a component that was fantastic and one that seemed out of place.  With the duck came some sauerkraut type side that didn't really fit and the lamb dish, while there were some wonderful components, had a little brown sausage that was on the dry side and a completely different flavor profile than the rest of the meat.  We're not sure if it was a bad day or that these entrees just missed the mark.  Given the nice surroundings and comfortable feel, it would've been a home run if the entrees lived up to the hype.  That being said, we're contemplating giving it another shot in hopes that the other entrees are executed better. @datenitenyc",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cookshop-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'm happy to report that all the lauded praise is well earned and deserved!!  You absolutely have to have a reservation to secure a table on the weekends as they get literally overwhelmed by all of like-minded patrons waiting to get access to the seafood barrage!!  I had a 7pm reservation, but we still waited about 20 minutes for our table.  You travel downstairs to the main dining area and once we were seated, we were given an explanation of the paper menu ordering system, and we proceeded to choose a good variety of everything they had to offer.  The 115 dollar lobster option, in my opinion, is the only way to go.  Everyone at the table has to get it if one person wants it, but it is totally worth it.  One thing to consider is that they bring out dishes extremely fast, so take that into account because our table was completely filled in less than 10 minutes!!  Also, the portions are humongous, so one person can get a dish to share with the table, not everyone having to get a particular item each.  Largely, all of the food was successful, with the lobster, of course, taking center stage!!  Whether the steamed option, the fried option, or cold claws,  they nailed the cookery every single time!!  The other items like the Dungeness and Snow crab were cooked well, but a touch on the dry side.  The other items like scallops, whole fish, flat iron steak, shrimps, and salmon we enjoyed as well.  The server we had was quite friendly, and she was engaging with us thoughtfully throughout our whole meal.  Service was pretty decent as the wait staff were quick to remove empty plates and the big steamer pots that started to dominate the space and took any additional orders as we needed them.  I recommend that you skip the starches and fried items or simply order them last.  They give you 2 hrs to go in on the buffet, so you can fill up on the premium items and get those options like noodles, rice, vegetables, or anything you missed to take home.  They price it out according to what's on the table, but they were extremely fair with the calculations, so we left with a good amount of food.  They also will sing happy birthday to the lucky patron, with your meal for free with four other full price meals!  They honor your birthday meal the day before, of and the next day, which is super generous!!  We felt rushed at the end, but when we were leaving, we saw why?  There were like 80 people   waiting to try and snag a table!!!  So in that respect we gave them a pass. This restaurant is so worth a trip here, as you will leave filled to the brim and you'll already be looking forward to planning your next visit !!  Cheers to all!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/crab-house-all-you-can-eat-seafood-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We got the $80 ayce seafood option (vs the $115 option that includes lobster). There was a good variety of seafood on the menu which I appreciated. The oysters were good, very big. I mainly came for the snow crab legs, and although good, it was too salty. I prefer cajun style seafood and the snow crabs legs tasted like they were just showered with salt here. All of the seafood has a slight Asian flavor to it which was ok. Service was also not the best, we were not given any crab crackers/tools to eat the crab with until asked, which I believe should be a given at a seafood restaurant like this.

As you walk downstairs you could smell all the good seafoods being served. At first the seafood came out really quick and was still hot. After that it was a little more difficult to get our servers attention but it also started to pick up. My favorite dishes were the scallops, oysters, calamari, and Dungeness crab. The scallops were nicely buttered and cooked on the skillet. The oysters were big and fresh. There was something about the coating of the calamari that was so good!

We ordered our drinks and then selected from the menu.  They were out of lychee so I went with a Hennessy sour.  It was strong!  Then the food started to come.  We over ordered from the first sheet.  They bring 2 more sheets for additional ordering.  The food is great!  Lobster was delicious!  Mussels were too.  Steak is minimal, so we ordered it twice.  Dump bucket on the table and we bordered with another booth, separated by some sort of banister.  They should add privacy glass there.  I felt bad to throw our scraps in the bucket with someone's face on the other side of the bucket.  They didn't care because everyone is chowing down.  We had the wait staff sing happy birthday, I think ours was the 8th time we'd heard it for the night.  In any event,  fun place.  Mussels are amazing,  good sized lobsters.  Seafood has been cleaned.  Need the lemon juice sooner in the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/crab-house-all-you-can-eat-seafood-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The literally give you a check list to choose the items you want, and if you're not careful, you'll have a table overflowing with food right out the gate. Everything was delicious. Though, for the shrimp, I enjoyed the spicy shrimp (skewers) more than the hand-breaded shrimp. I think the snow crabs make this buffet well worth the price.

And i didnt care for a lot of their sauce. If i were to ever go back I'd definitely bring my own sauce with me. Also i don't understand why everything has to come family style. Its such a waste of food. Especially if 1 thing is being ordered for 1 person. We were 2.5 people. I say half cause my daughter is 5 and eats the size of a peanut. When we ordered edamame it was a huge dim sum basket size. And it was full. I understand they want you to get full off the cheap items before you get to the seafood but if i don't wanna eat it you're just wasting it. What they should do is lower the portion sizes and just charge people less.

Service was decent, although they mixed up our dishes a few times.

Edmond C.,/user_details?userid=SBL1yLcXBvXAxGV7r0jYdw,"Anaheim, CA",3/12/2023,4.0,"Crab House will take care of your seafood, crustacean desires. I recommend going with the lobster upgrade and everyone in your party must do the same. Go with people who will pay for the upgrade, for the waiter will not have some in your party ordering without the lobster upgrade. They only take reservations for parties of four or more, so go with people who are on time. Your reservation lapses in fifteen minutes. These things must be understood up front. Now that practical considerations are out of the way, let's talk about the feast you will experience. The sizzling steak is not to be overlooked and don't miss the various ways they prepare shrimp. Seriously, the lobster is what this place is all about and please have at it. I did and so did my friends visiting from out of town. They want to come back and so do I! Yes,they have veggies and other things like very good lobster mac n cheese, but do not overload on carbs and beverages. I kept the waitress on standby for more orders of lobster. I preferred the regular steamed lobster over the fried salt and pepper lobster tails and I kept'em coming. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is nicely divided among multiple dining rooms, but your focus will be on the lobster.

The garlic noodles, salt and pepper Dungeness crab, any of the shrimp dishes, the steak, the broccoli and the scallops were EVERYTHING. Not to mention they bring everything out with the quickness. We only went two rounds before feeling like we needed to be rolled out but everything was well seasoned and well cooked. With some all you can eat spots fresh tasting food can be hit or miss but they definitely rose to the occasion here. I'm usually a great food photographer but I was so hungry my pictures are trash.

Honestly, the crab were just okay. It wasn't as sweet and decadent as quality crab, and you can taste the difference. The food was plentiful, and the service was top-notch, but at the end of the day, if I'm paying $90+ per person after tax and tip, I'd rather take that and get surf and turf or get premium crab, rather a bunch of mediocre old tasting crabs that just don't quite do it for me. I would not return, but this can be adequate for someone who is not quite as picky, and is looking to get stuffed.

Denica A.,/user_details?userid=T6rGRHkGyFV81X8rBxdagw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",8/13/2022,4.0,This is one of my favorite places to eat. The deal is the best in the city for all you can eat seafood and it's easy. The service is great and very fast. They keep the food COMING and it's nice and hot ! When they all you can eat they mean that. So come with your belly empty lol. If you want lobster it is an increase understandably. The variety of drinks are so good and super strong. My only qualm is Pattie's less than 4 there's no reservations but they do have a waitlist allocated for smaller parties. However that wait can take hours depending on the day so be warned and plan your day according.

This is wrong on so many levels, because you don't get to walk off the first serving. Then you get a cute server like Erica, with that nice smile, bringing more of those darn order sheets to your table. You finally have to say 'No'! The food was great, all seasoned to perfection. I can't list what we ate because the order sheet is very long and that should give you an idea of what we did eat. When in NYC, give them a try because we will go back.

I was interested to see what all the hype was about but unfortunately it was not what I expected.  The group I was with was anxious to try it , and being seafood lovers thought why not try for the experience ? Well this was NOT the type of restaurant to actually enjoy tasty seafood especially at the set price they charge !  Everything was very salty . Once the order was placed, it did arrive all at once in family style  but piled up on small table -- being we were a party of 6. It was overwhelming and not enjoyable. There was no proper room to actually eat. Yes, you get crab legs  but you cannot  even enjoy them in this way. The owners / management apparently want to serve a full house but with no care / regard about customer satisfaction or comfort. More of a factory feeling , and rushing your order on table without organization. I like eating in slower pace maybe. So this was not for me . I am glad I got to try but I won't return.

Around an hour later, we were seated and by that time (7:30) , for the people that just arrived- the wait time had increased to a few hours. Everything was socially distanced and felt safe as each party gets their own individual booth. You order everything off a paper menu. We got lobster tails for an additional price but I would just stick to the food on the menu next time. We tried mostly everything- shrimp garlic noodles (only came w/ a few shrimp/ good flavor), basically all of the different varieties of crab and shrimp (favorite were the crab legs), raw oysters, crab rangoon, calamari, sizzling steak (pretty good!), black bean clams( i think my favorite thing- so flavorful).

Woody C.,/user_details?userid=moWPoUOEWNHCK_QrVWBAnQ,"New York, NY",5/4/2022,5.0,"I think this might be the only AYCE lobster place in NYC. Yes it's a bit pricey, but I felt it was totally worth it. They exceeded my expectations. Everything is very fresh and cooked to order and cooked well. My favorites were the lobster, scallops and steak. Everything else I tried was still very good except for the clam chowder, which I felt could have had more clams and a creamier broth. Hope they can make this better, otherwise please take it off the menu as they already have so many other good options. Other than the hostess at the door who could have been more welcoming, service was friendly and very attentive constantly checking in and did not make you feel guilty for ordering too much. Really hope they keep it up. I see that prices have steadily been increasing, but hey they need to make a living. I don't mind as long as they keep their stellar quality.

There was no hostess, but we called and they told us to come downstairs. The staff was running around and seated us. We ordered by checking the things we wanted on a piece of paper, like a sushi restaurant. They brought it out really quickly. Everything that we wanted! Shrimp, blue crabs and crawfish in spicy sauce. Black and pepper dungenous crab claws, snow crab legs, chicken wings, fried calamari, garlic noodles and shrimp, raw clams and oysters, hot iron steak! And they give you as much as you want. No judgment zone, lol. Most recommended the shrimp in spicy sauce and shrimp in old bay. Snow crabs are dungenous. Blue crabs were a little small.

Then they both walked up to me and said ""the kitchen left"" i explained that the hostess said i can stay the waiter then replied ""im going to just walk away"" she went and called the cops because they did not want to serve me.  I feel like this was a case of discrimination how do you call the cops on a paying customer.

I joined the wait list around 6:15 (we only had 3 people so we couldn't make a reservation).  The waitlist was set for around 60 minutes, which was fine. Then I got a notification that things were moving quicker than expected and to check in by 7:09. We ended up checking in around 6:40. We were supposedly second in line for a table. We stood there for another 20 minutes. Then they called us back to be seated...except that was just to wait in another line for another half hour with not one person acknowledging us.

It makes sense since it's all you can eat for a pretty decent price being that it's NYC. This will not cut if you're particular bout your seafood. Now I can see this being some what okay to those who don't care much for higher quality. It's not the freshest fish either and very greasy in flavor. Extremely overwhelming oily taste. The oysters were so disgusting. My friend and I almost threw up tasting it. From the ocean straight to your plate. No lemon nor sauces served along side.

As we are walking around Manhattan, we start to get hungry so I pull up maps to find a seafood restaurant for us to eat at.

They explained to us how the menu works and we ordered some crab, shrimp, lobster, mussels, and crab rangoons. The crab rangoons were fantastic, they practically melted on our tongues. The crab legs were alright, nothing to brag about and the spicy shrimp as quite good. However, what they call their famous lobster was actually a disgusting piece of food. It was said to be fresh, but tasted like it was just in the freezer and was warmed up in a microwave that's 50 years old. It was tough and so gross to eat, that we threw away all the lobster we had.

Buffet may be the wrong descriptive word for this place, more-so, a seafood restaurant where you can order anything off the menu, as many times as you want. Our waitress was absolutely incredible (think her name was May). Everything ordered was delivered to table in less than 5-10 minutes.

However, I was shocked at how good the seafood was here. Now, it was quite pricey, even accounting for the NYC environs, but the quality more than made up for it. Skewers of jumbo shrimp tasted very fresh and tasty, not at all overdone. Unlimited jumbo sea scallops, properly seared, which meant they must have been the more costly dry and not the treated type, were delicious. Even the clam chowder, which was probably canned, but nevertheless was piping hot and tasty. We could not complain about the snow crab or Dungeness crab either.

When we were seated, we were explained how ordering goes and the process. You get a piece of paper and you check off what you want and then they'll just bring it. We ordered - snow crab legs, Dungeness crabs, raw blue point oysters, pan seared salmon, Cajun garlic butter shrimp, mussel with black bean sauce, crab cakes, pan seared scallops, crab Rangoon, old bay shrimp, iron steak, chicken wings, broccoli in brown sauce, Cajun fries and spring rolls. Everything was great. The only thing we didn't really like were the chicken wings but otherwise there were no issues. For drinks we ordered the a few lychee passions, Hawaiian sky's, Hennessy sour and scorpion bowl. The Hawaiian sky's weren't strong and tasted like juice. Our waiter ( I believe his name was Ky or Py? I feel bad for not remembering because he was great)  was amazing. He was on top of everything.

Good servers are hard to find in fast establishments. The food seemed pretty good but What made everything go downhill was, Me and my best friend saw a mouse/ rat pass our table. We were both in shock. I've eaten at many restaurants even in the Bronx and have never seen this! Looked over to a vacant area near us and we saw another !

Stephanie L.,/user_details?userid=got0PN6oQDlMfIoCwMOZ7g,"Honolulu, HI",12/21/2019,3.0,"Just ate here. The staff is super friendly.  The restaurant just opened yesterday,  which I should have looked at more carefully when reading reviews (5 stars could have been from family members/friends at the grand opening). They tell you to try everything and then order more of what you like. However,  a lot of the dishes the portions are really big. The best dishes in my and my friend's opinion are the ones that actually were small portions, but better quality. Those were the scallops and the teriyaki salmon. Those both had only 2 pieces, so one for each of us. The sea bass was good, but it's a whole fish (small/medium size),  a lot for a taster. The steak was also tasty (8 pieces on a sizzling platter). The Dungeness crab was dry and a little fishy. They don't have a really good dipping sauce for the crab. They have tarter sauce, soy sauce, ketchup,  and cocktail sauce that you can get from the bar at the front. Also fresh garlic & lemon, but there was no utensils for the lemons and garlic to dish it out (probably just an oversight because they just opened). The edamame was okay, but the server said they steam it with the crab to give it flavor, but it tasted like just plain steamed edamame. The dumplings are like the frozen ones from the supermarket- not recommended.  The fried shrimp and calamari were typical bar food and just okay. The small piece of corn on the cob with the snow crab is good as well as the snow crab, but I would like melted butter to dip the crab in. The garlic shrimp and other shell on shrimp are good, but they give you too many if you want to eat other dishes. It was nice that they gave you gloves to eat your crab, wet hand wipes, and bibs. The blue crab is a whole small crab and even though I'm from Hawaii that is something my more adventurous friends would eat, but not me or my friend. They recommend the $55 all you can eat, but in small print they also tack on a 17% service fee.  I had 2 perrier waters for $7.50 & my friend had a $2 ginger ale. We split the bill and ended up paying $74.81 a piece. In my opinion overpriced,  but if you have a huge appetite you may be able to get your money's worth. I felt bad wasting so much food, but I feel the way they tell you to try everything and then order more of what you like is misleading.  If you want to take the leftovers it is an additional $15. In my pics the dumplings are in the dish with the edamame. My friend also had the clam chowder and said she's had better. The clams and mussels were good. They start you off with a garlic panini pressed toast, which is tasty. I also want to apologize to our waiter if our bill did not include tip, but I think the owner cannot tack on a 17% service fee and expect the customer to tip 15-20% more on the meal we received. It was questionable whether it was worth $70+. It definitely was not worthy of $80+ per person!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/crab-house-all-you-can-eat-seafood-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

She tried to bully us into believing we ordered something we didn't, it would have been ok if it was good, but neither of us are into crawfish and it just really wasn't good. We did not want to be those a**holes who just order for one bite and waste like it's no big deal. We  food. And I  spice, gotta say nothing was hot enough.

We did noticed something our waitress was doing to everyone on her side. Your first round was fast and she was attentive but then would literally disappear. There was a point where she was gone for 20 minutes and no one knew where she was, and once she came back she even told us to not ask other waiter for service because this was her table. which clearly became impossible since she disappeared so many times. If you order crab legs just know they bring you 2 at a time which is hard when you're a family of 4. So make sure to ask for more or maybe sit close to the kitchen so you can ask for things faster.

We put in a 2nd paper and it took so long for that food to come out and we was STILL missing a lot of the food that we had checked off. Mind you, they don't bring out enough food in the first place .

I was told that they charge $40 to pack up food but he would only charge me $20.

Our issue was that the service was kinda slow, didn't seem staffed enough. And we had ordered steamed shrimp dumplings and received a ""lobster roll"" which was actually gross. When we asked about them they said ""oh we actually don't have the steamed shrimp dumplings anymore"" they never asked if replacing them with those were ok. And assumed it would be. They were gross and chewy. We also ordered the seafood fried rice which had bits of shells from the mussels in the rice. Everything seemed a lot more seafood/ crab house than a creole restaurant.

Since it's still pandemic times, there is no indoor seating but there also isn't a line to get in. There is a park nearby you can go to, to sit and enjoy this delicious Chinese cuisine. I highly recommend the spicy wontons- the chili pepper oil sauce that the restaurant adds to this dish is the bomb dot com! Probably the best item in the menu if you like spicy food. Also got the chive and pork pan fried dumplings, pork fried bun and the special noodles with meat and bean sauce (dry).

I ordered pancake with pork and the meat was very little and taste bland. Beware your order is not served in the order you placed, even if you ordered the same item, the people after you might get their order first if you don't keep track. When I asked them why people who ordered pancake like I did after me were getting their order filled first and my order still not filled? Instead of apologizing they were giving nonsense excuse that people had ordered before me. Wow don't they know 185 is after 176? And both were same pancake orders.  There are better dumplings and noodle place just down the block on 295 Grand St ( Shu Jiao Fu Zhou), their food taste great and cheaper than Vanessa too!

Valerie B.,/user_details?userid=214eN1kXtATV06wAfv24iQ,"New Hyde Park, NY",4/17/2021,5.0,I lived in China for 3 1/2 years and have struggled to find really good boiled dumplings upon my return to New York. I live on Long Island and fried dumplings or fried wontons are much more common by me so getting good boiled dumplings has been tricky unless I'm clearly just not looking in the right place but so when I happened upon Vanessa's dumpling House I was absolutely thrilled to see that they had like six options of boiled dumplings and from the pictures they looked amazing. And I was so excited and they were as good as I was hoping. I got the pork and scallions I think dumplings and they were phenomenal. I was absolutely thrilled and couldn't eat them fast enough because I was just so happy. I was generous and shared with my mom and she also thought they were very very good. So I 100% recommend the pork dumplings at Vanessa's dumpling House. Unfortunately I don't live near this location. If I did I will be here constantly to get my pork dumpling  fill. I also got a milk tea and it was delicious. I don't know if they normally have Boba but they didn't have any when I was there and that was totally fine didn't bother me. But if you are a Boba lover maybe they don't get their drinks because I don't know if they consistently have it,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jay H.,/user_details?userid=vomeBb0d4JuSCxxnef1lYg,"New York, NY",3/16/2021,1.0,"I know we are in a pandemic and restaurants are struggling but to raise the prices by 100% is ridiculous. The dumplings are now $5 per order which it use to be like $2.50 prior to pandemic! The price is just outrageous since I can buy a whole bag of dumplings from the supermarket for $5.99 for at least 30 dumplings. One order only had like a hand full of dumplings and the quality definitely went down. It was so salty that it wasn't edible and the skin of dumplings was way too thick. It was a waste of money. The quality definitely went down and they probably hired non-chefs  to do all the grunt work. The food used to be made by the owner years ago, and the food was so good and price was such a good deal. Now there's no reason for me to go back anymore. Very sad to see business become so successful that their quality goes down and their price continue to go up? They obviously don't care about the dumplings anymore,  just want to make money. The quality definitely not what it use to be. :(",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I also loved their chicken and basil dumplings, very fresh basil taste. I tried the chili oil wontons and I loved that it wasn't TOO spicy; however, I felt that they should've come in a plate because it was sort of hard to eat out of the soup container; they were all stuck together and it was hard to dip the top wontons in the chili oil which sat at the bottom.

Sherene M.,/user_details?userid=qO6JzOPfPvlh6hOGcbcdLw,"Queens, NY",5/13/2018,2.0,I love dumplings so naturally I was excited to check out this spot. I decided to keep it simple and get 8 pork and chive dumplings. It was really cheap at 3.27 and I was absolutely starving so it wouldn't take much to please me. Sadly the dumplings are disappointing. The dough is a tad too thick and usually a slight burst of juiciness explodes in my mouth when I take a bite but that did not happen here. There wasn't much flavor. A lot of doughiness and not much else. The soy and sriracha don't help much. The sandwiches look good so I may return again to try those but def skip the pork and chive dumpling.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However, I really dislike the staff at this place. They are always really rude. One time when I ordered my miso soup, they forgot about it. When I reminded them about it, they gave me something that reminded me of an oily water. I told to replace it and they totally ignored my request.

This place is small with limited seating. I came here on a Friday night and it was packed, we luckily got the two bar seats by the door. This is the perfect place for cheap and quick dumplings. We ordered, basil & chicken dumplings, boiled shrimp dumplings with spicy sauce, chive and egg pancake, sesame pancake, and two sesame pancakes with veggies. The sesame pancakes with veggies and the boiled shrimp dumplings with spicy sauce were my favorite items. The chive and egg pancake was loaded with chives, didn't have much egg and had a ""fishy"" taste.

I came here right after eating at Shu Jiao Fu Zhou next door and the dumplings there are much better than Vanessa's. They were more fresh, tastier and cheaper. Service was also much faster next door, Vanessa's took their time and somehow, the food still didn't taste like it was freshly made. The skin on Vanessa's dumplings were too thick and the meat portion was small. Same with the pork fried dumplings, which were also too oily. I also had the sesame pancake with Szechuan style beef sauce. It came out lukewarm and the meat was dry. The only saving grace was the pickled vegetables, which added balance to the dish. The one dish I liked was the wonton noodle soup. The wontons were fresh, the noodles had a good chew and the soup was well flavored. Overall, this place just had mediocre food. Would I come again? I guess but if you're coming for steamed dumplings, I'd definitely go next door.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Brandon F.,/user_details?userid=LVPz8eSgaDFIJnARAqSHVw,"Rogers Park, Chicago, IL",7/25/2017,5.0,There are two things you must get here. Dumplings and sesame pancakes. I opted for the spicy shrimp and pork dumplings with a duck sesame pancake. Service is fast and you get your food but beware that there is very limited seating. I luckily snagged a table and was able to enjoy my rather cheap meal. $8.50 for everything and that was a great deal. The dumplings are PIPING HOT so be careful at first bite. It's not burn the paint off your car spicy but it is a heat that'll get a sweat going. The sesame pancake was also delicious because they loaded it up with duck and some hoison sauce. There might be a line when you go but you aren't eating anywhere better at this price range.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There was nothing special about the fried pork bun it was just like any other Chinese pork dumpling. The sesame pork pancake, however, tasted noticeably different.

Was just stopping in for a small bite to eat while we waited for a table at a nearby restaurant. Only split 4 dumplings with my friend, but they were so good! It was less than $2. We got the pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings. The dough is crispy from the pan and just the right amount of chewiness. The meat inside is good too and clearly homemade. Want to go back and try their chili oil dumplings and pan fried pork buns. Minimal seating as expected, but really can't complain.

Used to be $1 for 4 fried pork dumplings a few years ago but even with $1.25 is still very affordable. When your tummy calls for food ordering fried dumpling is good and fast. Order and eat. Lol. The dumplings are still big and juicy. Still yummy but I felt the past it tasted better. The cashier are friendly. There's a few tables and chairs. Stools in the window area for people watching. Restroom for customer to use. But if you ordering out the wait can be at least 10 mins. If you are lucky you can get your order faster. Depends on the availability of the food in the wok and steamer.

It does have a few tables, but it is a very hectic restaurant which I would qualify as a fast-food parlor.

There were a ton of people in there and very few tables and chairs so we had to fight for a table...probably a better idea to take it to-go.  Service isn't super friendly but the ladies behind the counter seem to work really hard so I can definitely let that go.  Overall I think this is a solid place to stop if you want cheap dumplings and you just so happen to be right there next to the restaurant.  If not, there are better places in Chinatown you can go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Peggie Y.,/user_details?userid=-tU7fN7RjhukaahyS1zk0g,"New York, NY",4/9/2016,4.0,"Vanessa's Dumpling House is the go-to place in Chinatown, Manhattan for some cheap eats.  I would recommend trying their spicy wonton if you like spicy food and the pork and cabbage dumplings (I prefer cabbage over chives).  If you liked homemade soy bean milk, they do have that here, you can choose betwen hot and cold & sweetened or unsweetened.  Everything is priced under $6, so you could have a feast without going broke.  The restaurant is very small and offers very limited seats, so if you want a dine-in experience, you would have to stand behind some fellow diners like some hyenas waiting to devour the prey after the lions and tigers are done eating in the wild.  Usually people would get the hint and finish their meal and conversation in a timely manner and leave the table for the next customer.  With that said, this is not the place to bring your date to, even if you wanted to be a cheap date (order the food to go instead if you really had a limited budget for a date :D).   This place is CASH only, but they do have an ATM right outside the store.  When you walk into the restaurant, walk towards the end of the room where the cash register is and place your order by choosing from the menu in front of the cash register or right above the wall behind the cash register.  After that, you will be given a receipt with your order number.  People at the kitchen would then prepare your order and call out your order number.  The only issue is that the speed of people getting your order ready at this place is slow, so don't come here when you are super hungry, you will go bananas.  The bathroom at this place is an attraction because of the amount of graffiti on the wall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Arushi K.,/user_details?userid=AbexOYDYPj04inR6NY0-EQ,"NJ, NJ",9/18/2018,3.0,"Rating purely on food- the dumplings were doughey and not very well stuffed. Although the seasoning in the stuffing was great, it took time to chew through the dough to get to it. The 'dumplings with hot sauce' just came with the siracha.

The scallion pancake was very dough-y and the parts that don't have scallions were very plain.

The first lady we asked give us some attitude (""you want to return it after you have already ate it?"" But like how we suppose to know until we taste it) and then after several minutes of feeling kind of uncomfortable and struggling to decide if we should go up again, I went up to another lady who seemed like a manger and told her about the noddles and she told me that ""they put the same amount of sauce on all the dishes and it's up to the costumer to decide how much to mix it in."" Of course I was like yeah yeah I understand (cause I ain't trying to start any drama here) but they really should've told us that if that was the case. we ended up throwing it out (for the food).

They have a good selection of different dumplings (that you can take home frozen I believe). I tried a few things... The fried dumplings were simple and delicious. Exactly what you expect. The noodles with sesame were straight forward and had lots of veggies. I had a pork soup which tasted a lot like a pho. Sesame pancake sandwich with Peking duck was probably favorite. The bread had a lot of chew which I love, the duck was moist and full of flavor. Fried pork buns, again simple, straightforward, delicious. Seating is very limited so show up early or wait for awhile to sit. Order in the back and watch as they prepare/package your order. This is probably more traditional flavors of this cuisine.

I used to come here during lunch time when I was in high school. Til this day, this is my go to spot if I'm craving dumplings or sesame pancake with beef but to me this place is not super delicious or special. Somehow this is just a place that's been around for so long that I'm used to going to. The food tastes good but there are places that taste even better. I guess cause it's been around for so long, I basically grew up around it, it's become part of me. The price increased but it's still affordable and filling which I like. They actually have a small section inside the city acre market in the Fidi area and the prices there is triple the price here which is ridiculous! Overall everyone should try this dumpling spot!

Cheap dumplings in Chinatown was our first stop! Turning to my trusty Yelp app, Vanessa's had tons of rave reviews and was super close to the subway station. We ordered a few types of dumplings, both fried and steamed, and loved everything we got! While we have had tastier dumplings elsewhere, you can't beat the price and portions of Vanessa's. I loved the pork and chive dumpling, pork and cabbage dumpling, steamed shrimp dumpling, and bbq pork dumplings. My friend ordered a boba which she said was good, and cost just around $3. I really wish I ordered a sesame pancake since they were cheap and looked tasty, but wanted to save my appetite for the rest of the day.

Kenny M.,/user_details?userid=GX_i8eT7nX7RST_srugtYQ,"Bay Ridge, NY",4/7/2016,3.0,You get what you pay for. You can get a decent lunch for under 5$. The Sriracha and soy sauce at table side were so watered down that they would slide off my dumplings. That's probably my biggest complaint. The fried pork dumplings were pretty good but the shrimp dumplings were bland. They have dollar waters also which is a plus since they're basically extinct in New York. Paid 7$ for 8 shrimp dumplings and 4 pork and a water. Was it worth it?

I used to live a few blocks away, and would cash in on 4/$1 pork and chive dumplings and sesame pancakes with veggies on a weekly basis. Always hot and fresh! Plus, I much prefer the east side location to the union square one. It feels more authentic and cozy, being on the edge of china town. Check it out!

Lauren N.,/user_details?userid=1TjJ1lFrdkKLVNWe6HAC6Q,"San Gabriel, CA",7/22/2019,4.0,"There were so many outstanding reviews for this place, and this was our first time in the Chinatown area in New York. So, why not give it a try? The eating area was very small- only around 5 rectangular tables to sit. For a better view of how the dumplings and pancakes are made, you can sit at the open counter. I talked to a local who told me that people usually share tables together. Ordering the dumplings were very easy, and considering the amount we ordered, they came really fast. They were a lot thicker than your average dumpling. I was expecting a lot more soup than I got in my boiled dumplings, considering the thickness of the skin! The basil filling wasn't too strong, which I was okay with. Usually when you eat out, the food can get really salty, so eating here was an enjoyment. On the contrary, the wontons were very good! The skin was thin and very chewy. The sauce that it came with was also surprisingly delicious. Now for the beef pancakes- not soggy at all! Light, thin, airy- yet,still crunchy. It was a little bit on the saltier side, but that's alright, since it balanced out with the dumplings evenly. I got an order of wontons, two dumpling orders, and a large beef pancake all for $18. You can't beat the prices here! I'm not sure if I would come back, since I like my dumplings on the thinner side.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Vanessa's, unfortunately, will not be on that list for me. I tried dumplings at three different places back to back in Chinatown, and Vanessa's was kind of a let-down. When we walked into the restaurant, it was completely packed. There were absolutely no seats and we literally stood there with our food for a few minutes until a big group left. Your order at the counter and pay right there as well. We got fried pork dumplings that came out really fast. In terms of dumpling quality, however, it was pretty meh. The meat itself tasted fine, but the wrapper was really thick and they did a shoddy job of ""frying"" the dumplings. Guess I shouldn't have expected great dumplings from a chain?

Stephanie H.,/user_details?userid=GUQ5Odz0dY_afWUEJOefEA,"New York, NY",6/11/2016,4.0,"Vanessa's Dumplings were always the epitome of cheap eats in college. I recently visited again after graduating almost 4 years ago. It was just as good and satisfying, just as crowded, and most importantly still just as cheap even after all the hype and publicity. My go-to's are still the pork/chive fried dumplings (4 for $1.50) and sesame pancake with beef ($2.50). The sesame pancake comes out fresh and hot, given the high turnaround. They're pan fried and cooked/baked in the pan so that they're crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and fragrant from the toasted sesame crust. I love beef shank because of the tendon part and the five spice marinade. It goes so well with the vinegary pickled carrots and fresh cilantro. Throw in some sriracha and it's as good as it gets when you're looking for tasty cheap eats in the city. I'm glad they're still around and still just as cheap.

The sesame pancake with Peking duck is amazing - for only $3 you get a sandwich that is tasty and stuffed with fresh Peking duck, cucumbers, and hoisin sauce that's enough for a meal.

I visited Beijing last October and had been dying for food that reminded me of the amazing food on my trip. The food that I had at Vanessa's definitely took me back to the wonderful memories from my trip! I had some delicious pork and chive boiled dumplings and a really good vegetable sesame pancake.

David N.,/user_details?userid=AjqX3dcPDBykQ6d49cOs-Q,"Alpharetta, GA",7/12/2018,3.0,"I found this place on our recent visit to NYC when I found out that my favorite spot Prosperity Dumpling in Chinatown had closed. Vanessa's is a bit larger than Prosperity was, with some inside seating and a larger waiting area. When we visited it was very busy, and there wasn't a clear indication of where you line up to order versus the people waiting for orders already placed. There was a fairly large staff working for such a small place, and the cooking area is visible from the waiting area so we enjoyed watching how the food was prepared. The prices at Vanessa's are very low, 5 dumplings for 1.75. They had other items as well, such as sesame pancake sandwiches, soups etc. We got two different kinds of dumplings, some shrimp wontons, and a sesame pancake sandwich. Our order took over 20 minutes to be completed but the food was mostly still very hot. The dumplings have a thicker skin which makes them doughier than some other styles, but the flavor was good. We liked the Pork and Cabbage dumplings best. Our friend had the shrimp wontons and did not enjoy them. The sesame pancake sandwich was good, we got beef and I wish we had tried the pulled pork but we were too full at that point. All in all, a very inexpensive meal and a fun stop in Chinatown. We would definitely stop by again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Shannon S.,/user_details?userid=uu17NeFw2p3dLUW-nlc9Tg,"Bay Shore, NY",11/14/2016,3.0,"My first time trying this place after reading the great reviews and watching a cover of it on one my fav Asian YouTubers videos. I was kind of underwhelmed. I ordered what most recommended - fried pork dumplings w/ chive and a sesame pancake with roast pork. I had to take it to go and when I got home I reheated. The fried pork dumplings kind of tasted fishy when I ate one and I'm allergic so I tossed them. The pancake was great but a bit bland.  I tried hot sauce on it and it just kind of masked the flavor into a crunchy glob of gelatinous pork in my mouth. Between re-heating the food and going a bit late, I'm going to go again and give the sesame pancake another try. (maybe even some bubble tea next time as well).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Victoria K.,/user_details?userid=iJMDvVg6Mgl43is4XxIKsA,"Cranston, RI",11/27/2010,4.0,"I selected Vanessa's after an afternoon of trolling Canal Street for the perfect bag.  A friend had recommended it, and said it was worth biking miles out of her way for late-night dumplings when a craving hit.  Well, anywhere in New York that's worth going completely out of your way for a craving must be pretty good. After waiting in a somewhat lengthy line, I selected an order of pan-fried chive and pork dumplings, an order of pan-fried cabbage and pork dumplings, and a scallion pancake.  My grand total for 8 pan-fried dumplings and a giant, fluffy wedge of scallion pancake: $2.75.  Yes, I meant to put the decimal point after the 2.  Each order of dumplings was $1 and the plain scallion pancake was only 75 cents.  They offer scallion pancake sandwiches which are stuffed with various fillings and cost more, but I knew this would be filling enough as is.  So with my wallet less than $3 lighter, I filled my belly.  The chewy and crisp dumplings have a slightly thicker dough than what I'm used to in the past, but I prefer the extra texture here, trust me.  That bit of chewiness is all the difference.  And the scallion pancake, it's a thick, fluffy wad of dough, flecked with scallions within and topped with sesame seeds, lots of them.  You will get your money's worth, and you will never be hungry again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The flavor of the pork and chive pan fried dumplings is perfect. You get four of these for approximately $1.50. I also had the steamed shrimp dumplings which I didn't care for. But that's just personal preference and taste. I also had (yes I tried different items :-) the sesame pancake with veggies which is pretty much a sandwich filled with shredded carrots and cucumbers. So gooood!!!! I got these three items and a can of soda for $11.50.

Alexandar C.,/user_details?userid=bIiEizE84UqkQo5TpwWeTQ,"Albany, NY",10/15/2015,4.0,Solid 4-star dumpling restaurant. I wasn't sure what to expect when a friend took me here but let's just say that I was very pleasantly surprised. They have a small menu with a variety of different dumplings in either 4 or 8 dumplings per order. We got the number 1 and 2 which were both fantastic. Pan-fried to perfection. There is dumpling sauce and sriracha on the table for you to dip. It's as good as it gets and also ubeeeeer cheap. The reason it rates a solid four-star is the combination of price and taste. I think we paid like $5 for a meal for 2. Come here for the best dumplings ever!

Marika T.,/user_details?userid=977iuLgSiG85t0kK2uLA7w,"Fresh Meadows, NY",5/24/2011,3.0,"Ordered the cabbage & pork dumplings and a roast pork sesame pancake sandwich the other day.  I didn't get to eat the dumplings because the bf didn't save me any (which apparently weren't good as the chive & pork dumplings) so I only had some of the sandwich. They cook the sesame pancake in a HUGE wok then cut it into pieces. The ingredients are similar to a banh mi: carrots, cilantro, and etc. The meat isn't your normal roast pork found hanging in the restaurant windows. The meat is actually pretty fatty and the pancakes are oily so this isn't the healthiest sandwich BUT it doesn't hurt to eat one once in a while. I'll be back to try the peking duck sesame pancake sandwich (and the dumplings I guess).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Andrew M.,/user_details?userid=mbHw9uIqnCWpl3OcRfSxAA,"Manhattan, NY",9/26/2015,3.0,Went here because Prosperity is closed (shame on you photographer person!). The pork and chive dumplings were good but weren't that flavorful. It lacked some of the herbs and seasonings from other dumpling places. Fried pork bun also okay. The sesame pancake here I liked better than prosperity but it's a matter of taste. This pancake is a little thicker and bready than the crispy Prosperity counterpart. It was okay but not the best.

So we ordered the shrimp dumplings it was soupy inside the dumplings and a ton of shrimp it was super tasty! My friend got a meat dumpling and he loves it! He goes here all the time and is always satisfied and loves the food. I got a sesame pancake with egg and it was huge and super heavy and filling. We also got a sweet and sour soup and that was quite delicious. The portion size was huge. All in all the quality of the food is amazing.

By the time we arrived at 11 a.m. on a Saturday, they had already sold out of the pan-fried pork dumplings we had our eye on. We settled for a couple orders of boiled pork and cabbage dumplings instead, along with an order of wontons and beef noodle soup. The dumpling wrappers were just thin enough to really made the pork filling the star. They tasted best dipped in a mixture of chili oil and soy sauce. Of the other dishes we tried, the noodles in the beef stood out the most for their doughy, homemade texture. The wontons were probably our least favorite dish, as they were drowned in a chili oil sauce that tasted a bit sour.

The spicy shrimp wontons could have been spicier, but it was full of flavor so I can't complain too much. The pancake was pretty heavy; I would have preferred it to be thinner so that it could be more crispy but the flavors itself worked really well together and almost resembles a Vietnamese baguette but obviously with a Chinese twist.

Choi Wan C.,/user_details?userid=s5DkUy6Suwbb8F4Fo2tB6w,"New York, NY",10/17/2011,3.0,"Went here yesterday to get an order of Chive & Pork Fried Dumplings. I heard from friends that this was a good dumpling place in Chinatown. It was 4 pieces for $1 which was quite a good deal. The dumplings came clumped up together which is a big err in my book. I originally would have given 5 stars, but had to take 1 away because the dumplings are always stuck together every time I come here and another because I don't like having holes in each of my dumplings every time I tried to separate them. Also don't like having the filling come out of the holes as well. Oh yea, and the packet of hot sauce that comes along with it? The Red Rooster Sauce is better. The taste and non-burnt condition of the dumplings are decent and rare among other dumpling houses I've been to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Perhaps my review would go from a 3 to a 4 if I were to sample their sandwiches or fried dumplings, but for now Vanessa's is pretty average to me, and not a place where I would go again for a second visit to NYC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Although there were no other customers at the time, we waited about 15 minutes for our food to come. The fried dumpling skin was really thick. AND not even hot! The boiled dumplings were okay. As for the pancake, it had been sitting so long the bag was wet and the bread was soggy. Who wants to eat wet mushy bread?? Needless to say, I was not happy with my experience at Vanessa's.

However, the place is a bit of a hassle, as I will explain, so be prepared and decide for yourself if it's worth it. You order by going up to a counter, ordering what you want, paying, and then they give you a number that they yell out when the order is ready. At 5 PM on a Saturday, the place was packed. Ordering was similar to ordering on a Saturday night at a popular bar. You kind of have to push and shove a little and be aggressive to get to the front and order before others who came in after you. There really isn't any sort of line. It was pretty crowded and then took about 20 minutes for our food to be ready. We were lucky and were able to grab two seats. Seats here really are limited. Don't come here with more than one other person and be prepared to take your food to go. There isn't even room to stand and eat if you had wanted to do that. The prices are extremely cheap so order whatever you want and decide what you actually like later. We got the spicy steamed shrimp dumplings that were extremely good.

God.  Have you seen the bathroom scene from Trainspotting, with the ""worst toilet in Scotland""?  For real, it exists, at Vanessa's Dumpling House.  It's an absolutely filthy bathroom, covered with graffiti - even on the toilet itself.  I've been to cleaner bathrooms at punk clubs back in the day.  If they can't keep a bathroom clean, why should I have faith in the sanitary conditions where they cook the food?  Another heads-up - there's not a lot of seating, so don't come in with a group of seven thinking you're going to be able to kick back and chat over dumplings.  My advice is to go to Vanessa's if you want to do take-out (they seem to do a hopping to-go business), and do your best to keep your mind from wandering and wondering about sanitation.   If you want a relaxing sit-down experience with a clean restroom, go elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nick G.,/user_details?userid=C4v720oqcfDwMEXKI6ODtw,"Manhattan, NY",7/23/2014,3.0,"Was recommended to my dining companion and I by his roommate so we decided to give it a shot. Upon entering I was pleasantly surprised by the large canvas oil paintings strewn about the walls in the small but ample dining space. We each ordered a set of steamed dumplings with a pre-arranged agreement to trade half/half. I went with the pork and he chose the chicken. Then we each added on a sesame pancake sandwich after seeing some fellow patrons devouring them as we waited on line. For drinks we went with bubble teas (my first taste of the trendy beverage) I chose almond and he went with vanilla. The order was made relatively fast considering the volume of customers and length of the line. I thoroughly enjoyed my dumplings and fell in love with the pancake sandwich. It lasted all of 3 minutes and I used the excess pancake bread to mop up the remaining dumpling sauce on my plate. As for the bubble tea I was initially in favor of the flavor and texture of the little balls (bubbles) that resembled marshmallows as I sucked them up thru the enlarged straw. However my counterpart did not share in my enjoyment and by the end of the meal he had convinced my taste buds to avoid the bubbles and just drink the actual liquid. Not an easy task considering I will eat/drink just about anything - ice cubes included. A major turnoff was the visibly watered down Siracha bottles present on each table. I found myself asking if the intention was to cut on food cost by saving on minuscule amounts of Siracha. If it was,  than they clearly are not in tune with the cheap impression it makes on the customer.

Back in the days, when they didn't expand the dumpling house nor have chain restaurants,dumplings tasted so much better. Dumplings were $1 for 5 pieces!!! Now they're $1 for 4 pieces. :( Beef pancakes were $1.25, now they're $1.75. =( Dumplings tasted much crispier and better back then.

Also the wide selectiom of other foods is great too.

FIFTY pork and chive dumplings (do you know how many dinners that is?!) frozen for an even ten dollars; that's insanity. The pork fried buns are a must-have as well, three buns for $1.25 - the flavor that these three pack is amazing, they are never over-fried and have a crunch from watercress. I could eat an entire palette of them, they're so good. They give you soy sauce and hot sauce for the dumplings, but the flavor they have on their own is delicious.

David W.,/user_details?userid=N3nx4UIXWL4OSBxRy7iSaA,"San Francisco, CA",4/21/2008,4.0,"Aside from the hand-made dumplings they serve, Dumpling House also serves stuffed pancakes, sesame pancake sandwiches, congee, and various noodle soups. The dumplings can either be fried or boiled and comes in various ingredients such as chive and pork, basil and chicken, or the flavor of the month. The sesame pancake also has various ingredients such as roasted pork, Peking duck, or even tuna salad. I decided to order the chive and pork fried dumplings, onion and beef pancake, and the sesame pancake with roasted pork. All the food is actually prepared in front of you. So see old Chinese ladies wrapping dumplings and using various machineries and wok to cook your sesame pancakes. The food isn't served on the finest silverware and China, but space is limited in Chinatown so you rarely see places with automated dishwashers. So I actually prefer the plasticware as it's usually a cleaner alternative. After biting into that first dumpling it was by far one of the best dumplings I had in a long, long time. The outside of the dumpling was cooked perfectly so that the dough was not too chewy and you taste the dough in each bite, yet it doesn't mask the flavor of the chive and pork. They don't skimp on the meat as every part of it is edible unlike some dumplings where it's made with that chewy fatty meat that you end up spitting out. The sesame pancake with roasted pork was also good as it is made with the mouth watering, flavorful, roasted pork that you find at every bbq house. Mixed in with the sandwich are pickled carrots and lettuce to balance the flavor of roasted pork and also adds a nice crunchy texture. The sesame pancake itself is coated with sesame seeds and is fried with sesame oil so that when you eat with your bare hands it makes your fingers a little oily but isn't overbearing or creates that greasy taste. The onion and beef stuffed pancake reminded me of the meat ball dumplings your order when you eat dim sum but wrapped in a doughy pancake. Overall the food was good but I wasn't able to finish it all which I normally feel guilty about for throwing good food away. But that guilt was mitigated by the fact that this whole meal only cost me $5! Yes, that's right $5!!! If this place isn't featured on Rachel Ray's ""$40 a day"", then I'd really have question her decision on picking places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Can't beat the dollar for food ratio. Not to say the dumplings are lacking either. They are not the absolute best dumplings I've ever had but definitely in the top 5. But at this price you can't really argue. Their dumplings, both boiled and fried, are mighty tasty. I usually get the boiled dumplings. Note that they take a bit longer to cook than the fried dumplings. Their other food like the sesame pancakes and the noodle dishes are all really good too. Their noodle soups are simple, straightforward, and CHEAP. My favorite is the beef noodle soup. $3 for a generous portion of noodle soup packed with bokchoy and delicious beef chunks. Spice it up with a bit of Sriracha sauce and you're good to go. My only issue is that they dilute the crap out of the Sriracha sauce. So you see it come out all red and watery don't be surprised it's just them being cheap and cutting the real stuff with a whole lot of water. It still tastes great though which is what matters most.

I'm no expert at making dumplings but I've had the fortune of eating varieties of them. Compared to the really good ones that I've had, the dough on the dumplings are too thick. Maybe that's why it's low cost, cause you are filling up on dough. The soup inside the dumpling lacked favors. Personally, I think that the dumplings should be small and bite size. You just throw one in your mouth without having soup dripping all over you. Personally I find it pretty hard to use my chopsticks, hold a container, and try to avoid dripping sauce all over my shirt and enjoy my meal.

There was nowhere to sit, or even stand. We ended up taking our food across the street and eating in the bar. It also took them a long time to serve us our food, which I found odd because they have these dumplings constantly on the boil. It's not quite like they're made to order. Still, the dumplings were tasty, and the price was right. I subtracted one star for the crowding and slowness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/vanessas-dumpling-house-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The skin is too thick, the filling is too dry and there is very little crisp to the skin. Their other hot item, the sesame pancake with your choice of meat, is meh.

There's also a sitting area which i think is pretty cool. So for the food hall some restaurant stands come and go. The food is good and there's a boba guys available inside the canal street market. I just think the food is on the pricier side though. I got steamed rice noodles for $9... was it worth it? No. Will i go back to get it? Also no. Was it good? Yes, but def not worth.

Dan K.,/user_details?userid=bOWIB-b-UlRr9CweTxOxAQ,"Albertson, NY",5/26/2017,4.0,"The food court at the Canal Street Marketplace just recently opened and got to check it out. The place is brand spanking new so it's clean and pretty hipster. I wanted to try the ramen, which is by ippudo, but going to save that for a colder day. There were a number of other fast casual oriented choices with a seating area in the back. Ended up at Oppa, the Korean barbecue place. Basically, it's bulgogi beef, spicy pork, sesame chicken (no, not the breaded and fried Chinese version), or tofu in your choice of burrito, rice bowl, salad, or mini tacos format. I went with mini tacos since they're sold individually and I could try all the different meats. They all come with some combination of chopped lettuce, kimchee, carrots, tomatoes, and sauces. Here's the kick - as any true Korean BBQ lover knows, KBBQ is best when the meat gets a little char on it, caramelizing the sugars to add a sweet taste. Oppa flame torches the pre-cooked meat right before serving it to you, imparting the goodness of Maillard reaction! Genius! I thought the blowtorch would leave a fuel smell, but not here. Note to the wise, the mini tacos (soft corn tortilla) do not travel well because of all the juiciness - eat it there if possible. Otherwise, expect a bit of a mess. Basically, the sauces make the whole thing taste pretty good. Of the three, I would have to say that the spicy pork was the best. It had a nice heat without being overwhelming. The kimchee was actually pretty decent for not-homemade. The staff was hustling and grooving to keep the line moving. The one guy who torches all the meats was clearly working quickly but he was paying attention, so props to him. Plus the food is served in a container that claims to be fully compostable! All in all, definitely warrants a return visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/canal-street-market-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Victoria K.,/user_details?userid=GqVI1z3jYW5p8FE-t_tiVA,"New York, NY",9/24/2017,4.0,"Was a fun experience, with overall a strong assortment of vendors. For food I tried Kuro-Obi, ramen was good but for casual ramen in this neighborhood I far prefer Ramen Lab in Nolita (with rotating chefs, but always unique and amazing). I loved Daveys ice cream sesame and green tea flavors -though the single portion was a little too large. The retail part is very well curated, specifically I was impressed by the variety and quality of organic, local, unique, and often handcrafted cosmetics. You can also find a brand of fresh face masks (single use, refrigerated ones) and a florist selling little bonsai-style creations for your home, both of which i thought were unique and cool. Would have loved to see a few more good options, and some of the boring ones (eg fresh and co and nom wah which has two other branches nearby anyway) replaced by more unique ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/canal-street-market-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were able to snag a spot as a walk in party which was nice. The spot by the door was pretty drafty though. Interior is really nice and well thought out.

That's why a star is off I felt like they weren't observant . It took a while to get just appetizers and drinks . Then our food came out . There wasn't someone coming back asking if we were good or needed anything . The servers were just very absent honestly . The food :I had the scallion pancakes. They were greasy and very flaky . I usually like my scallion pancakes with a little softness and flakiness to it . There was no balance . I did enjoy the eggplant with garlic sauce a lot . It's one of the best I've had . Also my other hiccup was the fact that rice didn't come with the entrees . Overall it's a cool spot will I be back ?

As for the food, my favorites were the spicy cumin lamb and beef in chili oil -- must order if you enjoy spicy food!! Sadly, I was disappointed by two of their popular dishes, crab tofu and curry fried rice. The tofu was soft and cooked well but did not have much flavor, bland. The fried rice with the curry flavor also did not go well together in my opinion. As for the other dishes, they were all delicious as well!

The food is absolutely incredible, the price is right and the room is trendy but not too hey look at me. There's not one questionable dish. Small plates, dim sum, noodles and entrees all top quality. Standouts are the crispy beef jerky, the fried chicken, shredded beef and bamboo shoots, Dan Dan noodles, wood ear mushrooms and the ribs. the ONLY thing they could improve on is the service. Both times I went I had to flag down the bartender or waitress after a good amount of time waiting without someone coming to the table to greet us, so we could order a drink and then again later so we could to order food.

I also loved the cucumber salad, super fresh crunchy and refreshing..",https://www.yelp.com/biz/antidote-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were disappointed because the dan dan noodles is one of our favorite things here and the quality of it this time was not good! Not sure if they're in a rush or something but was very disappointed. Also, it took forever for our drinks to come. Our friend got her drink, and me and our other friend had to wait 15 minutes for ours, and our friend was done with her drink by then.

First, let's talk ambiance. Decor and setting were awesome. Great place to go for a date night in BK. Food, 10/10. It was delicious. Spicy fries were an absolute stand out. From soup dumplings to sui mai and more, they really didn't miss. Drinks, another 10/10. Drinks were cool, delicious, unique, and their raspberry tequila drink is a top 10 in NYC. Music, Jazz music was crazy loud, couldn't hear each other speaking, that was unfortunate. Jazz was nice, just turn it down. Then, very weirdly, they did a last call for food around 9:45pm. This is NYC on a Wednesday night? At 10pm we tried to order a final drink...denied, bar was closed. By 10:08pm the lights were on and they were kicking us out!

I understand we live in NYC and a $17 cocktail is expected at this point, but I found our drinks to be pretty underwhelming. I've had much better cocktails in Brooklyn for cheaper. I really liked our starters (mushroom salad and cabbage) but our mains were lackluster. My partner got the beef with bamboo shoots and I got the spicy chicken which was extremely dry and had no other flavor profile beyond just being spicy. We wound up ordering the fried rice which was fine but nothing special.

The crying tiger was also very mid, the rice was very garlicky and tasty, but the steak was kind of tough and chewy. The rice really saved the dish. The BEST was their whole fried fish with chu chee curry. While the fish was a tad dry, the curry made up for it.

For mains, we had the Khao Soi Gai Special and chicken fried rice. Both were bursting with flavor, the right amount of spicy, and imbued with smokiness. For dessert, we ordered the popular taro mochi balls, which came with this delicious coconut ice cream. It's one of the most unique desserts I've had and contained the right amount of sweetness.

Fresh and delicious!!! Also had green papaya salad, Thai style mussels and spicey lemongrass soup.  Had the coconut ice cream for desert!! Fabulous. For lunch the next day we had the soup again -- so yummy and Kra Prow, Khua pling and Brussel sprouts. Al great -- oh and I had to have the Krabi forest martini too. Love this place!!!

The ambience was pleasant and I appreciate that the staff found a spot for us although they were busy and we didn't have a reservation. Given these redeeming qualities, I'd normally give this restaurant a minimum of 4 stars. But I won't because I'm feelin real salty. Why, you might ask? My dish came with a fried egg and I asked for the egg to be cooked through rather than runny. The waiter took the order like it was no problem. When the check came back, I saw that they had charged me $2 for ""EGG COOKED LONGER"". Are you serious??? I normally would not have paid given that this is a ridiculous excuse to charge more money (seriously...$2 for you to leave the egg on the heat 30 seconds longer??), I wasn't informed that it would cost extra when I made the request, and THE EGG WAS STILL NOT COOKED THROUGH!! but I didn't want to make my friend uncomfortable by being litigious over $2. Clearly Lum Lum needed the money more than I do if they're scrounging for every dollar, which is perplexing since they asked for our table after only 75 minutes of dining, so business must be booming.

Nick C.,/user_details?userid=PPTV5ry-LXvA1lEQMosdow,"Manhattan, NY",8/27/2022,4.0,"Friends of mine had been to Lum Lum recently and highly recommended it. I had been out most of the day running errands and i went for an early supper since I don't eat lunch. It is on 49th Street and unless you know about it, you could miss it since it is not on 9th Avenue, where most of the other Thai restaurants are located. it is a small place, divided into two sections. You enter and there is a seating area. When you turn the corner, there is a bar and additional seating,It is small overall so my recommendation is to get there early so you can nail a table unless you prefer the bar but seating there is limited to 3-4 seats. i looked over the menu with the help of the Q code and after getting a glass of cold water, i decided on the drunken noodle dish, mildly splcy, with mixed seafood. It arrived shortly after the order was placed-it was hot and delicious. I always forget the Thai name for this dish. Anyway, it was filled with wide noodles, seafood and vegetables mildly spicy with just the right kick. The staff was attentive and accommodating. It is reasonably priced for the area and the restaurant is clean and well maintained. There is also a full bar.

Lulu R.,/user_details?userid=u4eleObFq025QSE-uoZp5w,"New York, NY",2/6/2023,4.0,"After returning from Thailand and going in-search of khao soi in my own neighborhood, I'm so happy I came across LumLum. I've had it now in three different spots in NYC and LumLum's version is by far, the best, including the luscious flavor, the pickled greens, raw onion AND to top it all off, one big, fall-off-the bone, tender and delicious drum stick, just as I had in Chiang Mai. But there other offerings are equally tasty (if not a little pricey for the size, but not unusual these days)  and a little less standard than the usual Hell's Kitchen Thai joints.  Their Tom Kha Kai (coconut soup) is great and includes white cabbage, which is new for me and a great addition; their kra prow with pork belly also delicious (the fried egg stays soft and yolky even after delivery); the crying tiger is unique and done well - the steak is typically medium rare and the rice (also with egg yolk on the side for delivery), with garlic and shallot bits is really tasty and worth the price; the pad see ew is standard but good, but I may have messed up the pad ki mao, ordering without chili and not spicy, taking away some likely critical flavor (the large shrimp that were included were wonderful, though, and unlike most places, had shells to suck clean:); the side of morning glory was also really nice (I haven't seen many places) even reheated the next day; and the dessert of coconut milk pudding was a great ending (really wanted anything with ice cream, but not a great idea for delivery).  AND delivery was quick and thorough.  Really looking forward to exploring the menu further and going in-person.

David L.,/user_details?userid=NV0u95G-WcjZRAfCX-jcWw,"New York, NY",10/31/2022,4.0,"I like it here. Everything about the space and the waitstaff is charming and pleasant. The concept is a space that hosts traveling chefs of importance. That's where it can get a bit tricky. You get what you pay for, so don't allow yourself to think that if a chef is visiting from an oversees multi-michelin-starred restaurant that they will be cooking their regular food as if in their regular restaurant. This is not me complaining, just sharing a realization. Currently, including tax and tip, the multi-course meal is $124 and the wine pairing is $78. So, no, tonight I did not receive any of the dishes I saw on Erik Anderson's instagram page from when he was executive chef at Coi when it had three michelin stars. But it also only cost fraction of that. What you get is an opportunity to have affordable glimpses with industry veterans and taste some of their expertise utilizing local sustainable ingredients, and I appreciate that. It's just sort of a downer, to be honest, because if you only have one chance to try the food of a lauded chef, you kinda want what they're famous for, even if it's expensive, because you're investing in an experience & a memory. But that's neither here nor there. Back to reality. Fulgurances Laundromat is a lively place that I really enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/fulgurances-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Service was also okay, when they came to attend us they were kind and polite but they rarely came and they took ages to get us the check.

I understand why certain businesses do that but there are other restaurants in the neighborhood that are owned by a families (not restaurant groups) and they don't add a surcharge. If they're going to do that, they should let customers know by printing a message on the menu and on their website. For me, the only plus was the location and the music.

Emily C.,/user_details?userid=TMXpMq7uE40G_ivFCRV5Kw,"Queens, NY",7/8/2019,5.0,"This spot actually has some great curry with plenty of fried options available. The service is really quick and the portions are super filling. I went for the small curry but there was actually a good amount of rice. I added shrimp, pork katsu, chicken katsu and fish katsu on top. The katsu were all pretty thin pieces of meat. The fish in particular was really thin. I preferred the pork and chicken over the fish, which really isn't worth it. The shrimp was also pretty small but covered in plenty of breading. Everything was nice and crispy and the curry was really good too. It wasn't spicy at all. I wish there was just a bit more curry sauce though. I also added pickled radish which is a bit sweet and sour and gave a nice flavor contrast to all the fried items. The cabbage that is provided is also a nice refreshing touch. Definitely an affordable, filling, tasty meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/go-go-curry-new-york-33?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
