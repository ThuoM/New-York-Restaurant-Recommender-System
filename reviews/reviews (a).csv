The other guy walked out of the establishment and came back in and continued to make coffee with his scarf dangling off his face and his bare unwashed hands. At one point his scarf was below his chin while he was laughing around with the guy at the window.

Tried the wizard's comb cocktail and loved it. At dessert we shared the passion biscuit and chocolate situation. Both were wonderful. So for $65 prix fixe it's a deal.

We ended up eating with a chef of the restaurant as someone in our party knew her, so that was cool to get a glimpse into Oxalis' style and learn more about what we were eating. We ended up ordered... everything on the menu! My highlights were certainly the sourdough bread (which it seems like everyone and their mother is talking about); that butter was special!! But more than that, I loved the tomato spread with the rosemary lavender bread; I could have eaten that all up! I think the mushroom kebab (which just isn't a kebab at all) fell a bit flat, but still - all in all, this was a SPECIAL meal. The buttermilk dessert + the peach tart really rounded it all out. And my orange wine cocktail was delicious and served in the perfect glass. I know they have a more rotating menu here, so I'd love to come back sooner rather than later to try some great food. It came out to a bit less than $100/person, so considering it is a 1 Michelin-star place and we got everything on the menu, I think that's great; each dish isn't quite expensive so you can come in for a drink and some food and not break the budget. Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxalis-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The outside of the shop wasn't very impressive but once you walk in, it definitely felt very warm and inviting. My mom unfortunately made a mix up and didn't notice she put herself on the waitlist instead of getting the confirmed reservation. The staff did their best and offered their a la carte menu to us along with some free champagne (Obi Wine Keno Blue - cute play on Star Wars). Luckily as we were considering whether we should stay or not (not saying their a la carte wasn't appealing but mom wanted the big welcome for the new son-in-law), the general manager, Adrienne. stepped in and informed us someone cancelled. We were very lucky. (They usually have a set amount of ingredients and courses set for reservations so if you don't have reservations, from what I was told, they don't squeeze people in.) Everything was exceptional from presentation to taste. Service was wonderful and if I could come back more often for date night I would. Later, we found out their head chef (and owner) were originally from the West Coast (West Coast is the best coast - makes perfect sense why the food was so bomb) and moved out to New York to start his business here.

Sona D.,/user_details?userid=RmWLnIpEv1X3kGXoL8gxrg,"New York, NY",8/5/2020,4.0,"During Covid, this restaurant does temperature checks when you enter, tables are very spread apart, and they change the paper covers on the tables after every guest. We started off with stone fruit on ice, which was topped with coriander seeds. This was a great refreshing start to our meal there. We also got the sourdough bread with the most amazing softened butter ever! We even used it as a dip at one point haha. I then got the tomato tart which had a delicious dressing on top. The shishito peppers came with a ""teriyaki"" flavored sauce, which added a variety of flavors to the peppers.

John H.,/user_details?userid=7IHabO5YEGuBOeNMXFrOwA,"Midtown East, New York, NY",8/7/2022,1.0,"I went to Brooklyn with my partner to see an exhibit at the Museum and came across Oxalis. I have to echo the same sentiment that the service was poor / hosts were rude and incompetent. F+ at best. I called ahead of time (5:09 pm) to confirm if walk-ins were available for the tasting menu--which I was told yes. After stopping by in person, my partner and I were told we would wait 25-30 minutes at most and would receive a call. An hour and a half later I called again to see where I was in the queue and was told I'm next in line (7:30 pm). So my partner and I walked to a nearby bar to get a drink and chat. At this point (8:15 pm), we made a quick reservation for a 9:00pm slot (under the belief we would get an option for the tasting menu like promised) and walked over at 8:45 pm and spoke to the hosts. My partner and I were surprised by the passive aggressiveness and catty comments from the staff, and were told if we canceled we would be charged. Despite what we were promised verbally when we initially called 3.5 hours ago! We decided to take our business elsewhere. For how ""upscale"" this establishment is portraying itself to be I am surprised by the rudeness and lack of empathy my partner and I experienced interacting with this business / staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxalis-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They have a prefix tasting menu but they are very flexible with food allergy accommodations. I came when I was pregnant and there were several items on the menu that I could not eat. Our waiter communicated efficiently with the chef and was able to accommodate every one of my wishes. It is a pretty big spacious space inside. It is great for an intimate date or a night out with girls. I had brunch there and it was delicious as well. They have a big outdoor space that I can't wait to try in the summer.

Went for dinner and sat in the back courtyard. This is the more casual Al la crate setting. Still a lovely setting. But let me start with the greeting. You walk in the door and the kitchen is right there. Open and inviting. Smells of the amazing good greet you. A cook says hello and asked for our name. Even though there are hosts it was a nice way to be welcomed. We are led to our table. Every member of the friendly staff saying hello. Now let's get down to the main event. The drinks and meal! Every dish was heaven. The sourdough (fresh and warm with fresh butter.) Jambon! Totally different then plain old ham or prosciutto. The tuna carpaccio. Wow. Balanced and light. Sweet potatoes (lovely and light.) Next was the trout. This was the star of the show! I could eat this dish every minute of every day. And the beef was fantastic too. Drinks were fantastic and the wine selection is solid too.

Lynn W.,/user_details?userid=3DYLC4ZCEb4i_-xRugurZQ,"Flushing, NY",1/7/2020,4.0,We made reservations for a party of 10. Our prefix dinner was $70pp. The service was amazing. This restaurant is more American rather than French based on the food we had. If you're looking for French food this is not the place. I felt the quality of the food was very fresh and dishes were unique and creative. I love the open kitchen as you walk in. I would've preferred to see the regular menu however our meal started promptly when our party arrived. I didn't realize we had an option to try other items on their menu until we were done with our meal. This was not necessarily the restaurants fault but rather me not asking as I was content with the meal that was previously arranged by my party. I was curious as we left the restaurant what else we could've tried while we were there but did not get a chance to try. If you have a big appetite this prefix dinner would not have been enough to fill you up.

Christin M.,/user_details?userid=383fieseMn4s6pHoNY7ugQ,"Baltimore, MD",5/20/2019,5.0,"Highly recommended for an adult evening out, special date night, or an occasion to celebrate. You'll enjoy an excellent meal, carefully crafted and conceptualized, from start to finish. I'd also suggest, if you're a duo, that you request the table with front row seats of the kitchen and the chef at work. I thoroughly enjoyed the added bonus of a show and it was really neat to see the composition and plating of each dish making its way to us. Oxalis offers a prix fixe dinner service (offerings change nightly) with optional wine pairing at an additional cost. My spouse and I elected to go all in and we loved the complete experience of everything being expertly selected for us - what a fun and delicious treat! We also relished in being surprised with the menu offerings for the evening when we sat at our places (hidden but neatly placed under our napkin and bread plate). Don't be afraid to ask questions - the staff, even the chef, are very friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes, the creative ingredients as well as the wine pairings. I was also shocked by my favorite course of the evening; glancing at the menu I knew I was looking forward to the soft shell crab and while everything was excellent, I was absolutely blown away by the potato, ramp, and kombu spring stew. It was so unexpected for me, I loved every bite. Both flavor and texture variety were perfect. That said, be open to being pleasantly surprised. Oxalis will come through in an amazing way and provide a very memorable dining experience.

We had a party of 4, expecting great things and they exceeded expectations in a very big way! The meal was truly the best I've ever had. Each of the 11 dishes were works of art, with flavors that were out of this world. The Kampachi, the first course was so savory, like nothing I've ever tasted. Literally, each bite, I closed my eyes to experience the incredible blend of flavors. We had two more appetizers that were equally fantastic. We also did the wine pairing which had perfect choices for all the courses. I added caviar to the fluke, which was outstanding. The beef with walnut miso, and black garlic melted in my mouth with the greatest flavors. Three different desserts put this evening over the top. Chef Nico and the phenomenal staff made us feel so welcome. Chef Nico, you truly love what you do and it shows in your creative food ideas, presentations and phenomenal food. This Michelin star restaurant is a real gem. Bravo, Nico and we will return!

There are other places nearby that offer brunch but I had already been to them and wanted to try some place new.

So yes, it is pricey for brunch but the pre fix brunch menu is unique - not your run of the mill brunch dishes but still ""brunch-like"" enough...and definitely filling and delicious. If you love has browns or anything potato - Do yourself a favor and order the potatoes as an add on if they aren't part of your pre fix - even if you don't live has browns, this dish may convert you.

Bradford P.,/user_details?userid=klRvOVWm2MwWCxXXRS7Vdg,"Queens, NY",1/27/2019,5.0,"Behind the frosted glass facade at 791 Washington Ave is Oxalis, where wonderful things are being made and served. This restaurant works perfectly for the part of Brooklyn it's in, which you kind of feel before you even open the door. The quality of the dishes the Oxalis team serve will astound you and are worth every dollar. They do rotating tasting menus, but also offer food and drink off an ala carte menu in the back half of the restaurant. You can tell that Nico and Co. know what they are doing, and also, most importantly, that they care. Being able to watch the chefs and cooks working so diligently in the open kitchen is quite humbling, but also inspiring. I think we could all learn a thing or two about delicious, fresh, new ways of approaching food and it'll be fun to see it happen here. Aspiring chefs, foodies, and regular people of all walks of life, in and out of Brooklyn, should give Oxalis a try. Maybe you'll learn something new, see something great, or just enjoy a nicely prepped and prepared meal, served to you by their nice staff. The last time I ate there, I tired the pig trotter and it was my favorite. I also had a dessert made with cream cheese ice cream, which brought out my inner fat kid, for sure. I'm going backwards now, but the brioche bread was amazeballs. I am really excited for Oxalis in 2019 and can't wait to see what is on the way!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxalis-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Oxalis is without a doubt, the most pleasant, refreshing and jaw-droppingly delicious meal I've had in years. The food was otherworldly. We had the prix fixe and each dish was better than the last. The service was fantastic as was the atmosphere. I have a ton of food allergies to raw whole fruits and vegetables (I know, my life sucks) and they were so accommodating and created two entirely different dishes for me (though what my family ate for those courses was apparently also fantastic). To top it all off, the dessert (goat milk with honey and thyme - trust me, totally different than what you're probably imagining right now) was perhaps the best dessert I've had in my life and I've come to to the realization that was the peak of my dessert journey and I'm fine with that.

Great atmosphere with drinks / entree and apps. The japanese spaghetti about $22 was delicious, just wish it was a tad bit more creamier/saucier( add a protein, it's  only noodles). Chicken katsu with rice and curry was thick and filling. Ramen bowls looked great and not dense with oil.

Jessica L.,/user_details?userid=5Jyj4eHRlZHtyEWEgT764A,"New York, NY",10/9/2022,3.0,Came to this place to try. The appetizers were really good. The calamari a little different from most places. The batter was already seasoned and squeeze some lemons on it and you don't need marinara sauce. The takoyaki had the right amount of sauce on it. Some places usually drenched. The skewers were done well. But the sauce was too sweet. The chicken wings fried very well. But too much sauce overpowered the chicken. The don was okay. And the ramen unique flavor to it. Not a bad place to try. But I did not like the height of the food was at the appetizer and then went down from the entree. But my ramen unfortunately was too buttery and oily gave me a stomachache and had diarrhea. Flavors good. But maybe too buttery for the stomach. I would come back for the apps and maybe a different ramen that's not buttery or oily.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-juraku-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I like that the vibe is not pretentious at all, and there's no need to dress up to dine here. They have the usual Izakaya fare but we only ordered karage to share. The karage comes with a big portion. The chunks of chicken are meaty but tender and well battered. I also ordered the black garlic ramen, which was on par with what you would find at a ramen shop.

Benjamin B.,/user_details?userid=kVFo_IdWbM-sriAHKc0fxA,"New York, NY",4/6/2022,4.0,"There are many izakayas in NYC, many are also close to LES but  Juraku is the one I would most likely revisit. Unfortunately Japanese culture has fallen prey to the trap of conspicuous consumption in NYC and many places lose the charm of a casual bar that I associate with izakayas in Japan. The food is pretty solid, not the very best I've ever had but exactly the type  of thing I love to snack on while having a good time with friends in the evening. Much of their fare are small shareable bites, I recommend the skewers (particularly chicken), takoyaki, and croquettes. They also have some larger meal options like ramen and gyudon but I didn't try these and will not comment on them. They have a remarkably good beer selection, wide enough that I am more than willing to ignore their lackluster mixed drinks. You may be tempted as we were to try out the ""get fucked"" cocktail but it frankly just tastes of watered down Redbull, stick with beer and sake here. Overall though, I highly recommend this place if you are looking forward a fun, casual vibe where you can hang out with friends over a beer and some bites.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-juraku-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They also have great selection of sake if you love sake but don't think that's part of happy hour or maybe limited selection.

I was looking for a Japanese place that specializes in classic grill and dumpling items. They do that here, and it was very good, but to my great surprise and delight, they also have the most extensive drinks program of any Japanese restaurant in the country. No exaggeration. Huge selection of Japanese craft beers, including awesome rare Japanese beer on tap. For instance, they offer a Hitochino yuzu lager that was incredibly delicious. I liked it so much that I tried the other Hitochino on draft, which was a sour, and it was just as good! Subtle, refined, delicious, not ridiculous overhopped and in-your-face like American craft beers. Izakaya Juraku also has superb sake selection, again at very reasonable prices.  I had a lot of fun talking to the manager who is a super chill dude with a lot of experience in the NY restaurant scene.

You ask and they walk away without a word. Tip was included on our tab which explains the service.  Food was definitely a 5 stars for everyone in my group.

We had the fried pork buns and old style traditional noodles with fried scallions, wonton soup, the spicy wontons and boar's head. EVERYTHING was delicious including the traditional noodles -which just came with plain noodles, soy sauce and fried scallions. The boar's head was absolutely amazing!

I did not really get any crab in there. The noodles were really good, basic but so tasty, it was my favorite! The wontons were pretty tasty, as was the fried pork but the presentation was so bland and uninviting. They are using all disposable for eating and serving, this may affect presentation of a dish. I think they need to use regular serving platters, it takes away from the food display entirely. The place was very busy and had a constant flow of customers.

Tracey K.,/user_details?userid=7m4WIP82CReQfmsHtMyDdw,"Jericho, NY",1/29/2022,3.0,For soup dumpling it is very good.  We always get the pork and the wrap was not too thick and the broth was light and not too fatty.  But for small to average size dumpling 6 of them for $9.95 is a bit pricey.  I compared all soup dumplings to Joe's Shanghi which now thinking about it was actually very fatty.  However the other two dishes we ordered we weren't completely happy with it was just average.  And note a bowl of rice does not come with a dish it has to be ordered separately ... unreal,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-21-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Courtney E.,/user_details?userid=tSbU2uhQpoHW2QDWOhhWSw,"Manhattan, NY",11/10/2021,4.0,"I've been wanting to have a food excursion in Chinatown for a while, and now I finally got the chance. I went to Shanghai 21, and the food was great. They have a combination of traditional Chinese cuisine and the American Chinese food variety that is more widely available in the city. They have a reputation for having the best soup dumplings in the city, and I can't deny. These soup dumplings are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! The Black Truffle Soup Dumplings are the best. They are so flavorful. The Fried Tiny Buns with Pork are also great. I, generally, like Pork Buns, but these tiny buns at Shanghai 21 are such an improvement over the traditional. The proportion of bun to pork is perfect! I noticed many diners ordering the Dry Sautéed Shredded Beef Szechuan style, and it did not disappoint! The flavors in all these dishes are just so complex with traditional Chinese cuisine flavors, sweet, salty, and umami. The only knock that I have for this restaurant is the wait time and how they keep track of their waitlist. My friend and I arrived and were told the wait would be a half hour. After about a 15 minute wait, a group of about 6 people arrived, and they were seated well before my group of two. Otherwise, this is a great place to try in Chinatown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-21-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I've missed Chinatown so much, and was so excited to go back to my favorite restaurant Shanghai 21. Everything from here is truly delightful. My personal MUST orders that you cannot pass up: pork soup dumplings, truffle pork soup dumplings, Szechuan chili wontons, and scallion pancakes. Today I also added in the cold peanut sesame noodles, and unsurprisingly they were wonderful. I love it here. Keep in mind this place is BUSY, like always, obviously for good reason but keep that in mind. For lunch you might have a wait, and for dinner you will absolutely wait for a table unless you arrive at 5pm. It is most definitely worth the wait, but just something to keep in mind! They accept AMEX credit cards ONLY, or cash. Another pro tip; they do not take reservations, again they don't need to- first come first serve.

Although I didn't get a chance to take a picture, my party and I tried the truffle soup dumplings. Although it is around $13, almost double the price of regular soup dumplings, they were definitely worth the try. You have to like mushrooms though - and I would get it again. I highly recommend the Shanghainese rice cakes, soup dumplings (ANY kind is delicious), the watercress and shrimp dumplings, and fried crispy squid. The fried rice was good but nothing too special. The service was great too because they did not try to rush us even though we were there for about two hours. You rarely come by this when you eat around this area.

The soup dumplings were great, same as when we dined in frequently before covid19. However, after leaving the premise to eat the food, we discovered that we were given a dish of bok choy with shitake mushrooms with an extra topping of chicken instead of the dish I ordered. It's fine that it was probably honest mistake. But the chicken tasted bad like it was added as an afterthought. I didn't like the shitake mushrooms or the bok choy. The sauce wasn't good either.

From Din Tai Fung in California to Shanghai Asian Manor here in NYC, I can really put some of these things away. We had to wait about an hour to get in, but it was worth the wait. Each set comes with six dumplings at the price of about $6 per. I usually order two sets per person (I am in my 20's so don't judge!). The soup was savory and I could tell that they were had prepared in the back. The meat on the inside had umami out of this world. Love this place and will be taking friends back in the near future.

The pan fried pork buns had a nice seasoning in the filling and the dipping sauce balanced the flavor our well. It had a nice crispy exterior, but the dough to filling ratio was a little off and at times the inside was more of soggy dough than filling. The truffle soup dumplings never disappointed, as the truffle paired really well, bringing out the richness and aroma of the broth inside the dumpling.

The service is a little hurried but honestly when it's that crowded it's to be expected and the food is so good, it's impossible to care.

Whether you dine-in or order takeout it's really efficient. I love their xiao long baos or soup dumplings. I prefer the pork meat only one. But the crabmeat one is delicious as well. I don't remember what the truffle one taste like, but I will definitely try it next time. Their pan fried pork dumplings are really tasty, I would definitely recommend to get this as an appetizer to share... or not. It comes with a yummy sweet and thick soy sauce. I love adding that sauce to my noodles.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-21-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It did not disappoint until I found a hair on one of the dumplings and then lost my appetite. But before that, the food was delicious HAH! (I get it, it happens, the waitress handled it well and comped us for that dish.) ANYWAYS- We ordered the famous steamed crab meat and pork soup dumplings, steamed vegetable dumplings, scallion pancakes, wonton szechuan style dumplings and beef lo mein. My favorite was hands down the szechuan style dumplings. These dumplings were bursting in flavor that I was dipping everything in this sauce. I would go back and have 3 orders of these dumplings and the scallion pancakes which were my next favorite. Beef lo mein was good and the other dumplings were good but average in my opinion.

Their noodles are thicker than the ones I usually get, but they were still good. The soup dumplings were delicious, just wish they had the dumpling sauce I usually have at my other usual Shanghai restaurant instead of the vinegar infused soy sauce they have here. I think this place has my favorite scallion pancakes. They were SOOO good; a good portion for the price and super crispy. We also got the chicken fried rice (not pictured). I mixed some soy sauce and hot sauce with that which I really enjoyed. The line was starting as I got there which was around 7:30pm on a sunday. The place is pretty small, so expect a wait.

Gosh, there were people everywhere. Good, at least we are not alone in this world and everybody loves food! So we checked the menu. It's a bit different than the classic Chinese style cooking. The food here is sweeter. They have friendly and smiley staff here. They don't have snails, so we had a whole fish dish, wonton soup, and Pan fried crispy noodle with seafood. The fish was a fried yellow fish and served with sweet sauce. This was quite good but I want to try their steamed fish if they make some. Wonton soup was delicious. The noodle was made perfectly too. When it comes to hot sauce or hot oil on the side, I need to stress that it wasn't as fresh. It seems it's not being preserved well because the taste turned sour and had a distinctive smell.

The black bean and mince pork noodles (炸醬麵) was tasty but could of had less of the sauce as it was a bit salty. Last but not least the Pork Bao (生煎包) was delicious and nice and crispy on the bottom.

Just a few stores/restaurants down from Joes. Walked in, more spacious here and you don't have to share tables with anyone. My bf and I waited only about 10 min to get seated. Service was quick and fast, servers were on top of their game. We ordered the pork soup dumplings along with the pork &shrimp dumplings. They give you 2 less than what Joe's give you, but I wasn't complaining. Soup dumplings were delicious, to die for. They tasted similar to Joe's dumplings, which is excellent.

Annie K.,/user_details?userid=hFpNIimvmgvDIDEo7t9-OA,"Manhattan, NY",5/23/2016,4.0,"To revise my other review, I give this place 4.5 stars. The soup dumplings are bigger than other shanghai restaurants in chinatown, and do not arrive at your table looking wrinkly and shriveled up, which is a definitely bonus for presentation. This time, I did not have an issue with pre-punctured soup dumplings. For the most part, they were on point today. I tried the crab and pork soup dumplings, and I would have to say, I still prefer the classic just pork soup dumplings. The broth in the crab one has a strong crab flavor, and the texture of crab mixed with meat doesn't do it for me. The broth in the pork soup dumplings on the other hand, are always perfectly seasoned. Unfortunately, the first 2 platters we ordered arrived at our table partially cooled down already, so I won't be giving 5 stars this time. Soup dumplings are definitely best eaten hot, even if it means sacrificing your mouth by accidentally burning your tongue when you're overly excited to dig in. However, our 2nd round of pork dumplings did arrive piping hot, just the way I liked it. I definitely recommend ordering a bit at a time, and adding to your order especially for soup dumplings to ensure that they were freshly steamed instead of letting each platter sit at your table for too long.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-21-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They do not take reservations but we were seated as soon as our party got there. Best of the meal was the siew long bao also know as soup dumpling. Everything else is a hit or miss, either too bland or too salty. I guess my review is towards a staff. The waiter that served our table was nice and all but the lady in the back that packs the takeout bags was rude. To prevent fighting for the bill, I decided to walk to the front to pay for the bill but was told by the front lady that I would have to go to the back and there's a cashier there. I followed the waiter, waited for the bill and opened up my wallet. Then an annoying short lady kept repeating HELLO HELLO HELLO x50. I assumed she was on the phone but no she was talking to me. Now mind you there was a counter head level and on top of it was takeout packed in bags so she expected me to notice her talking to me through the bags and she's like 5 feet. The waiter that took me there spoke up and told her I am paying for the bill just take it when she's done and she gave a bitchface saying why I have to pay there and there's no table. First of all bitch it takes time to take out cash since you ONLY accept American Express credit card now. Second, instead of repeatedly saying HELLO why don't you try EXCUSE ME. Rude and unprofessional. Been here numerous times but this was the worst I had it here. Props to the waiter that spoke up for me though.

The Shanghai noodles were great, but wish we had a little more. I have to take one star away because the ""chef specialty 5 flavor duck"" was extremely bland. The presentation of the dish looked very promising, but as soon as i bit into the dish my face was full of regret. The skin was soft like boiled chicken and the sauce tasted like watered down curry. The more appropriate name for this dish is watered down curry duck, not five flavor duck. I much prefer the duck from ANY other Chinese restaurant. We couldn't even finish the dish.

Muffin T.,/user_details?userid=jWFxlRMpCv_kc_2HPqKTbg,"Brooklyn, NY",3/16/2018,1.0,boy this place really went down the crapper. so sad. we had a few amazing meals shortly after it opened but after about a year of not being able to get a table due to crazy long lines we finally got in and discovered that the food quality has fallen to barely a notch above cheap takeout. There was a general lack of flavor in the sauces and cheap chewy meat. We ordered enochi mushroom which in the past has been such an amazingly luxurious dish but now is just gross glop over bitter watercress. The pan fried noodles turned into sloppy sponges almost immediately and the soup dumplings were really watery. Everything was bland even the black vinegar sauce for the dumplings. What happened? The one good thing is that now we wont feel bad about not being able to get a table!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-21-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Louie M.,/user_details?userid=BcKX1iBje_xeYQZcvpjQLg,"Sugar Land, TX",7/31/2019,4.0,"$63.96 dinner bill less tip for 4 people is a bargain by any standard, never mind in NYC. The bigger surprise was how good the food actually was. We ordered the truffle and pork soup dumpling, regular pork dumplings, 2 individual orders of egg drop soup, 1 medium order of corn chicken soup, chicken lo mein, half roast duck and 1 green grass jelly w/ soy milk drink. The soup dumpling and regular pork dumplings came out nice and hot, and delicious to boot. The truffle flavor in the soup dumpling was very apparent, and definitely made the flavor profile much more interesting. The chicken lo mein was above average, with the lo mein noodle itself with a more substantial and chewy texture making the difference (think al dente). The roast duck drumsticks were a bit dry for my taste, but the entire dish was delicious nonetheless. Peking duck it wasn't, but the dish didn't come with the Peking duck price either! Don't expect atmosphere or even kitschy, since the place is unabashedly about the food. The small space can also get quite noisy at times. But the service is friendly and attentive enough. There was a fairly even mix of Chinese and non-Asians to give the place a bit of an interesting vibe.

It may be all the rage, but after trying them, I conclude that I prefer dumplings in my soup vs. soup in my dumplings. Nothing against these specimens, which were tasty. They just didn't wow me, and left me wanting a bowl of Wonton Soup. With that said, I am a simple man when it comes to Chinese food. Wonton soup, Sesame chicken + Fried Rice & I'm good to go. Shanghai Asian Manor is the best I have had in a long time. The sesame chicken was not overly battered or fried, making for a moist chicken bite with a crispy crust, in a very rich sauce.

My party of 8 ordered regular soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, along with fried gluten in sauce, shanghai noodles with chicken, and some scallion pancakes. The truffle dumplings aren't anything special, I wouldn't go out of my way for them, nor pay $12 for 6. That was just absurd - it was a good experience though. The taste was peculiar but tasty. The fried gluten just didn't fit me too well. However, SAM redeemed themselves with the shanghai noodles. The noodles had so much flavor and was cooked to perfection, probably the best place I had these type of noodles in Chinatown. The scallion pancakes were tasty as well, crispy and fragrant.

Teresa Z.,/user_details?userid=cw6JUhbiCvjG7YsjUBGp4g,"New York, NY",1/28/2015,5.0,My go to spot whenever I am in the mood for some hot soup dumpling!!!!! This place definitely has the best soup dumplings in Chinatown. I always eat in here because I live two blocks away. Their soup dumplings is nice and juicy and hot when it comes out. The soup is the perfect flavor and with a little bit of vinegar you can pop one right into your mouth. I also love their wine chicken and kaofu as my two cold dishes. Pan fried noodles are on point with the right amount of crunch without giving your jaw a workout. Best part? A meal for 4 people would cost you less than $50 and everyone will leave full and satisfy!

I wanted to compare it to Joe's Shanghai and see how their xiao long baos were. I shared xiao long baos, watercress shrimp dumplings, and zha jiang men with a friend. The shanghai buns were pretty good compared to joe's shanghai. The soup wasn't as juicy but it tasted less greasy. One can really taste the crab flavor in the soup. The watercress shrimp dumplings were just simply adorable, the wrapper was actually green itself!! That was one of the reasons why we ordered it, hah. The noodles weren't mad, but I found it too greasy for my taste. I like this place because of the variety of shanghai food they have.

They are super juicy, full of flavor, and don't fall apart when you pick them up unlike some other ones I've had. I prefer the pork dumplings to the shrimp/pork ones. The Braised Lion`s Head Meatballs are also amazing. They are massive, incredibly tender meatballs with mushrooms, bamboo, and bok choy. Give this a try if you're looking for something a bit off the beaten path.

Foodie Z.,/user_details?userid=dkQkH2OPKSlN25otwvPTrA,"New York, NY",8/8/2015,4.0,"NYC is loaded with tons of Chinese restaurants - it seems like every 2 blocks there's at least one joint serving Oriental food. Unfortunately though, restaurants offering authentic food from the Sichuan region in China are hard to find. Bored of the usual, Americanized menu items, I hoped to have a taste of spicy, flavorful food. Shanghai Asian Manor more than sufficed. For appetizer we got the wontons in Szechuan style. Immersed in a chili oil, the pork wontons had a very delicate balance of flavors. The entree of chicken pan-friend noodles were absolutely delicious too - a burst of flavors in the mouth. However, our third dish was a problem. We specifically asked the server for a recommendation of a seafood entree that was spicy, and not at all sweet. And of course, we were served shrimp in an extremely sweet sauce that we couldn't have more than a bite of. When we conveyed our disappointment the manager, he very readily agreed to change our dish. However, he let us in on a little secret... Even this place that claims to have authentic food, has molded itself to suit the American palate. Therefore, he told us most of the sauces will have a certain tinge of sweetness. Nonetheless, we were happy with the replacement he suggested (don't remember the name)! The jumbo shrimp were gigantic and the sauce was quite tasty as well. To sum up - some excellent food and good service.

Our son was most excited to try the prawn, which is still on the menu but what you actually get is shrimp, although you're not informed of this when you order. We were also excited for Wagyu since we loved it so much last time, however, it is now ""premium beef"" but you're not told this upon ordering, either. I would call what we had today skirt steak at best. Even the famed chicken skin is fatty and tough to chew and service is lacking.

Came here on a Thursday night after seeing Betrayal on Broadway (which side note, was excellent) and sat at the bar area where you could see the chefs grilling the meats. I had the chicken bun, the chicken bowl, and the chicken dango (allot 15 min for cook time). The bun was a good appetizer - the chicken was a tad dry but the bun was very soft. The bowl was filling and I liked mixing the egg with the rice. The rice was super soft and it was a good proportion to the chicken. The service was really nice and I liked how it's a good spot for solo eating. There were tables in the back of the restaurant too however for bigger groups. They do take credit cards. Note that you need to take the stairs up to the second floor and the restaurant is a bit narrow.

Gluttonous Pig L.,/user_details?userid=chQrlKvuTlTjYsPSRHeBfQ,"New York, NY",8/24/2019,5.0,My favorite yakitori spot in town by far.  I love how each piece of the skewers are grilled meticulously and examined before serving.  The grill master definitely display a lot of pride in their work.  We are frequent patrons of this restaurant.

Ordered the croquettes, fried soft knee bone for appetizers and the following skewers: beef tongue, premium Japanese beef, chicken skin, chicken oyster, smelt, gizzard, pork neck, chicken meatball with sauce, and soft knee bone. We also got a sardines with preserved veggies over rice to share and the tofu dessert. For skewers the standouts were the Japanese premium beef, pork neck (amazingly delicious!!!), and soft knee bone. The appetizers we got were all delicious and would definitely get them again. I would skip the beef tongue, it was very tough and tasted very weird. The smelt, gizzard and meatballs were nothing special so would skip those as well. The rice was delicious and was very filling with some pickles and miso soup served on the side. Would highly recommend the dessert which was very refreshing and not overly sweet. Service was standard but they were very quick.

Portions were really small for the most part but tasty, exception to the unaju which I'll talk about more later. Skewers were around U$3,00 to U$3,50 and tiny. I have worked for several Japanese restaurants as a chef and I had not seen skewers as small as Totto's. But the worst part was when I ordered some Unaju (fresh water eel over rice). My wife likes it more saucy as it was very dry and I asked the server if it was possible to BUY some more sauce. He just said NO in a very rude and unapologetic way without giving any excuse for that: just a blunt NO! Japanese culture is all about politeness by expressing and living out OMOTENASHI. Unfortunately that didn't happen to us and we ended up having a real bad experience.

I thoroughly enjoyed two different beef skewers and a bowl of the spicy Negi Tori Don. This rice bowl came with a soft cooked egg on the side that when poured in over the rice adds flavor and texture to the rice that I haven't experienced before. Drinks are a bit overpriced here. Including tea. They charge for each cup, no refills. So if you have two cups of tea that's $6. Just a heads up.

The interior is small and almost cramped feeling but that's what it looks like at most Yakitori joints I've seen photos and video of in Japan. If you get to sit in front of the kitchen like I did you get the tortuous pleasure of smelling the aromas of the food items cooking on the grill. And you are also treated to a good show! But the fact that I was seated right in arms reach of where the waitresses pick up the food was just so terrible, I felt like grabbing every freshly made skewer that was set on that raised counter every time they placed an item there. Speaking if waitresses, the waitress was very courteous and polite, I give this place top marks for their service! I got a refreshing glass of Sapporo beer which I liked a lot, my first time trying Sapporo. My food order consisted of 4 skewers  which were the Pork and Green Onion, Chicken Breast and Green Onion, Bacon wrapped asparagus, and Chicken thigh. The Pork and Green Onion was alright, nothing really jumped out at me there. The Chicken Breast and Green Onion was a good pairing. Bacon wrapped Asparagus, well do I need to say more lol.

I know different places are different, but come on! This is yakitori..... And $3 per stick is pretty expensive. Back home in LA, yakitori would be the same price but they give u 2-3 sticks of meat. So comparing, I would say eating this place isn't that worth it. The chicken soup was yummy though. Very light but had enough flavor to give it that tasty factor. Service was ok in my book. I think they had some big reservation at 7 and was kind of rushing all the guest. So I didn't kirk that.

Yum!!   Dumplings were homemade but suck together and stuffing was falling apart.  The chicken was very good and the wings.  Love the tuna appetizer  the presentation was beautiful. The prawn was good but lack flavor.  The 1 age dashi tofu was delicious and 1 cheese fried was good as well as the baby salmon roe and mayo as dipping sauce for the cheese roll.  Edamame was good you can't screw that up and if you do you need to close.  I would come back again and try different items.  Last page of menu $20 min per person per order.  Really?!   But we ordered plenty. Service overall was very good this place is on the second floor but it is small and comfortable.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yakitori-totto-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Hannah L.,/user_details?userid=T800smDbCLFEyhmsdlxduw,"New York, NY",9/12/2017,3.0,"Yakitori Totto!  Been meaning to try this place for so LONG!  Every since I got back from Japan and had the BEST yakitori every in my life in Tokyo, I had to get my fix again in NYC.  Every time I came to Yakitori Totto, the line was always long and the wait was unbearable for my group.  However, last week, after a random week day, I went with my friend.  The yakitori did not remind me of the food that I had back in Japan.  We got the braised pork, sweet & spicy fried chicken, chicken thigh, scallops, and pork with scallions.  My friend ordered the lamb for herself while I drank their $6 shot of plum wine.  Starting off with the braised pork belly - the mini potatoes that were beautifully peeled and shaped, were too salty.  The braised pork was delicious and some of the best pork I have ever had, but it too was too salty for me.  The dish was marinated in soy sauce and as I'm writing this review, all I can think about is the saltiness of the dish.  The sweet & spicy fried chicken was missing the sweetness and spiciness.  It was fried to perfection, with a nice crunchy bite to the chicken wing, but again, sadly, too salty for me.  What I can recall is just salt, and can't really remember the sweetness or spice.  The chicken thigh skewer was under-seasoned, and so one bite of the fried chicken and one bite of the chicken thigh would have been perfect!  Unfortunately, each yakitori dish came out separately, so couldn't do that combo.  The best dish of the night would have had to be the pork belly and scallion yakitori skewer!  It vaguely brought me back to that rainy night in Tokyo, where I had shared with my cousin while visiting the peaceful and beautiful country.  Onto the next place to search for yakitori!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yakitori-totto-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Karen M.,/user_details?userid=CiD5A6d1CpLnpPrhlIbpNA,"Brooklyn, NY",11/19/2019,2.0,"Decent food, but they have some policies that made me pretty uncomfortable. I got there early so I could try the chicken oysters, but the other member of my party was still ten minutes away.  I asked to be seated so I could start ordering for both of us, but they have a policy where that's not allowed - even though there were plenty of empty seats. I get why they would have that policy, but the hostess was pretty rude about it, which put me on the defensive. By the time we were seated, they were out of the chicken oysters which left me pretty annoyed. After we started ordering they let us know that there was a $20 minimum, which is frustrating when most dishes are $3. There was some pressure to just keep ordering.

Xiao Y.,/user_details?userid=gbOWGuEMcj4wJNDCmTDt0A,"New York, NY",11/15/2016,1.0,"Had the single worst experience at Yakitorri Totto. I used to come here a lot. Loved their high-value lunch menu. Tonight, however, the nightmare started with seating. Me and my friend were seated after a few minutes' wait, which was good. After we were pointed to our seats, we took a second to take off our heavy coats, while another party of 2 were taken in and seated next to us at the counter. The waitress, completely ignoring the fact that we came first, went straight to the other party of 2 to take orders. After a prolonged ordering process and serving a bottle of sake, she finally came to us and asked ""are you guys ready?"" ""Just so you know, we were here earlier than those guys, so it would be nice to ask to take our order first,"" I complained. She started rolling her eyes, clearly not understanding one of the most basic principals of waiting tables. After finally taking our order in a pretty rude manner, she began unleashing her dissatisfaction about my complaint by banging bowls, glasses and dishes on to our table. It was one of the worst experience I've ever had in a Japanese restaurant in New York, the likes you d usually expect a higher standard of service. I'm not sure if I would come again. The food isn't great, especially at the price I'm paying. My friend was also once refused to order food here when she came late to join us for lunch, because clearly ""me and my party have drained my time at the table (30 minutes), and we should clear it out for the next party"". I am utterly disgusted by the attitude I've been receiving here, and I sure hope it has nothing to do with racism. With such high level of competition in midtown New York, I'd suggest them to upgrade their service as soon as possible to match their reputation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yakitori-totto-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You can certainly put together a memorable and delicious meal, and the salmon siokara is unique and wonderful, if you're up for something different. Four stars instead of five for a few reasons: first, that they did not have most of the more interesting meats on the day I visited, which was disappointing, and service/ambiance were so-so. Second, the tuna and avocado salad was a disappointment. I expect Japanese food, especially salads, to be thoughtfully put together and served in small quantities. This was the opposite of that: a very large serving, and for lack of a better word, sloppy. The avocado was of guacamole softness and tasted mashed... with tuna. Because that was an appetizer, it was a negative, off-putting note at the beginning of an otherwise good meal.

Selection offerings are creative but a bit limited. Also, service was friendly but not attentive at least for our table.

My friends who are visiting from France don't read English well and not Japanese at all, it took us longer to make an agreement when ordering, and the waiter was obviously showing an attitude with no patience. She did not even ask whether we want a salty flavor or a sauce flavor as listing options on the menu and automatically made all of them salty. Our order was mistaken and forgotten for THREE TIMES for different items, unbelievable! Second time we asked for additional order, she dropped the menu in my friend's hands and WALKED STRAIGHT AWAY back to the counter without even saying a word. Our check came without our request, with an item that we ordered but never came counted in. There were plenty of seats and it was around 10pm, had no idea what they are rushing on to get us out?

They always have long lines and that's fine because their food is good. But their service is really bad. When I step into the door they said do you think you can finish before 7? We said yes. When we get seated, the waitress said did not ask for any drinks and just said you last order should be at 6:30. We didn't get it first so asked again. She repeated with her cold face. We then ask so what's the time now. She showed her watch right in front of our face with an impatient look and looked the other way. That's enough for me. If you don't mind awful service, you can go.

It reminded my husband and I of our favorite place to eat in Japan. The portions are small and you need to order a lot in order to get full. One order of chicken wings is one chicken wing. Everything we ordered was good with the exception of the udon I  ordered which was just ok. I probably shouldn't have ordered udon at a yakitori restaurant. The bacon wrapped asparagus stood out as being excellent as well pork belly and kobe beef tongue. The mushrooms were good as well as the chicken wings. The mochi ice cream was also really good.

Caryl B.,/user_details?userid=bAeNPuuBU5KuwEn3ICMBtQ,"New York, NY",5/5/2018,2.0,"So, I read the reviews- some raves others not so much. But we love Japanese food and wanted to try a new place for a special dinner. We made reservations, and were told on two separate occasions that if we were 15 minutes late, they would be cancelled. I get it, its a busy, popular spot. No problem, we were all on time and they happily sat us quickly and graciously.  Sadly, it went downhill from there. The not inexpensive bottle of cold sake we ordered was served lukewarm, ruining the delicate flavor and our server, in a blatant attempt to get us to finish and order another bottle, constantly refilled our glasses so it never actually had a chance to cool down in the ice bucket. They had poured all the sake before most of the appetizers even arrived. We declined a second bottle because the first was such a disappointment. Dinner for 4, with appetizers and multiple yakitori mains, was a rushed and throughly unpleasant affair. Overall, the food was ok- a couple of their house specialties were actually quite good. Our server who initially only gave clean replacement plates to the men at the table, forcing the lone woman to ask for a clean plate, was constantly grabbing plates off the table before we had quite finished, in an attempt to rush us out the door. We were not offered or served tea at the end of the meal, and no mention of whether we wanted dessert, as we had clearly reached our allotted one hour limit for a meal. Is it authentic food? Yes. If you are in a rush and don't have time to linger over or even thoroughly chew your food, this could work out for you. If you need to run to a show in the theater district, for example, I can almost assuredly say you can have a fast meal here. As for me, there are so many other yakitori places to eat in the city, I don't need to come back to this one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yakitori-totto-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The yakitori was $3 a skewer which is standard in NYC and some of them were really delicious (beef tongue and gizzard) but the servers were really disorganized which ruined the whole experience. Our skewers were dumped on the table and the waiters were already walking away when they told us what was what. We were even given 4 chicken skewers we didn't order and when they figured it out, they gave it to the correct table who wanted them replaced. Can't blame them, I wouldn't want chicken skewers that were sitting at the wrong table for 5 minutes. Also we tried the chicken meatballs that were coated in sticky rice and steamed.

Every item they brought out was better than the last. First of all, yes, there is a wait... even during a downpour. But while you're waiting, ask for a drink. It'll make the time go faster! Highlights of the meal included Totto's Kimchee (how I loooove pickled foods!!!), Negi Pon (pork loin with scallion and ponzu), Pork Mustard (clears your sinuses right up!), and Chicken Oyster. I was a little conflicted about the Negi Tori Don at first.. initially, the flavors seemed blander than the other dishes.

When I saw this was featured with Anthony Bourdain, what can go wrong right? Wrong. I didn't have a reservation but I was seated straight away since it was early (6pm). The first thing I noticed is that they ask for $20 min spend per head. I thought, fine. I ordered a couple of skewers, Maguro sashimi, takoyaki and beer and ice cream between 2 and the bill is already over $100. you'd think for the price there should be good quality control and service right? Wrong. First came the Takoyaki. They were still cold from the fridge. Then came the skewers- the chicken was undercooked, the rest was fine even though I was surprised how quickly they came out. Before I even finished my skewers, the waiter kept pushing us to order dessert or get the bill. This was 6:30pm. Barely much time to chow down food and enjoy my company. I ordered ice cream, and then they brought me the bill with it to ask us to hurry up and leave! Incredible. I bided my time to EAT the ice cream while the server kept checking to see if we've paid. Obviously NOT! I didn't even ask for the bill. When I paid and just let myself out, it was 7pm $50 per head for poorly cooked food only to shoo you out within an hour? Seriously. Even Mcdonalds would treat you better. If they're worried about reservations then they shouldve told me. I wouldve gone elsewhere. But no. They want my money but I certainly won't be going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yakitori-totto-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I've been here a dozen times and never have I left feeling less than fully satisfied. With or without alcohol, any day of the week, any time of the year. Of course, the meal's always best if I can get there at 5:30 and have my go at the chicken oysters, knee bones, neck, and everything else that sells out by 6:30. Even better if I can get there at 6:30 and eat all of the aforementioned goodies without having to wait an hour before being sat. It's all good though. The wait seasons the tummy. And sold out specials just means ordering more of the other goodies--gizzard, liver, skin, thigh, shitake... even the tofu (both deep fried and fresh), marinated octopus, salmon roe, silverfish, eggplant & mochi... all make me giddy with pleasure! Ok, the only thing they can't do is kimchi.

We split the Totto Ramen and the Totto Don lunch specials, which were averagely priced for the city ($9 & $10.50). The miso soup was standard but the complimentary salad was really good! I am normally not a salad eater but the dressing was delicious. I felt bad because I offered my salad to my friend but ended up eating it hah. On to the main dishes - that ramen is the best ramen I have had so far, which includes Ippudo's. I love the spicy sesame oil in the broth, which was soo good even though I normally don't like spicy food. I even drank the broth, which I normally don't do. The noodles were cooked perfectly. The rice was ok, a bit too moist for my taste but the chicken meatball skewer was good - comparable to the ones from St. Mark's. The nigima and wing skewers were a bit bland and not memorable but were cooked and presented nicely.  I would come back here for lunch if I am around the area because the food is great, the space is nice, and there is no wait for lunch.

Anyone who doesn't love meat on a stick should be considered at least marginally insane (including those crazy hippie vegans). So let's say you go to this place with a solid appetite and want to get your fill of some good ol' dead animal protein. You order a couple of Yakos and they bring out a few of the mini shish kebabs. You eat them, you're still hungry, you order 5 more, you're still hungry, you drink some sake, you order a side dish, then BAM! They stick you with a $30+ bill! If that's not bad enough, your date (who stuffed herself full of $40 worth of Yakos and is starting to look like Rosie O'Donnell) sticks you with her part of the bill too. There goes your booze money for the weekend. Don't get me wrong, they're good. But if you're a big (and not even fat) guy like me who wants the protein and can't get full without blowing $30-40 here AND can't hardly fit in the cramped space, just take $10, head down the street, and go to Island Burgers & Shakes. It's just as good but WAY less money.  The Yakitori is solid, but it's a ""Totto"" ripoff!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yakitori-totto-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The seaweed salad was plentiful and complex in flavor and, again, worth repeating. We had two orders of Udon with Chicken, vegetables and mushrooms were reportedly very very good, though they took a lot longer to arrive. Good food is worth waiting for and, honestly, the wait was not too long. It only seemed longer because the edamame and the seaweed salad arrived almost instantly.  Let the line of people waiting to get a table be your reference if nothing else.

I've had much better renditions of this in SF so it was really a meh dish. Service was pretty fast and efficient but the one thing that made me give it 3 stars instead of 4 stars (if it was only based on food) was that they had initially told us a 5-15 min wait over the phone... we walked over there in 5 mins and it had ballooned up to 30 mins. I think we ended up waiting a hour. I much rather them overestimate the time than to keep us waiting since we had somewhere to do after dinner.

Leila Y.,/user_details?userid=-aR05qZuZDa1EDWiX1MA9w,"New York, NY",6/11/2012,4.0,"I called to make reservations a week before i wanted to go, the lady on the phone asked me when I wanted to go, what time and my phone number etc. I thought that the reservation was complete, however after she found out I needed a table for 6, she told me it was booked and I can just come in and wait for a table. I wasnt sure why she asked me all these questions to tell me that they were booked. The day that I went, my friends and I waited about 30 minutes which wasnt so bad. While we waited the chefs were screaming something that I didnt really understand. I think they were saying welcome and bye to the guests. We got this private area in the back which was nice. Our waiter seemed a little nervous but he was really nice. He messed up some of our orders. But it was ok, at the end he resolved it. Everything we ate was really good. I really enjoy the beef tongue ( really chewy), meatball, chicken heart ( taste like some liquid squirt out of it when I ate it), and the udon (the noodle is thinly than I am use to). I love how they have three small bowls of salt and favoring so you can add on it for extra taste. I felt the short rib and skirt steak needed some favor, so this was perfect. I felt like everything I ate was really good. I felt I needed to eat a lot to be full, so at the end I ordered some udon. The udon was really good, the soup taste so yummy. Even though the stewers are inexpensive when you order a lot, the bill adds up. For a group of six we spent about $230. Before we left we decided to have some dessert, I had the Affogato, which was vanilla ice cream, mochi (which had no filling in the inside), sweet red bean, tapioca and hot green tea (you had to pour it in yourself). I felt that the dessert was really good, except I wish the mochi had some filling in it, I think that would make it taste better. Everything was really good and they didnt rush us out, which I was surprised because their was a long line outside. As we were walking out the chefs said goodbye to us.

Toto.  It's on the second floor up a long flight of stairs but well worth the walk.  Juicy kobee beef tongue, a skewer of cow hearts, skin ... that's right skin on a skewer (I don't know if it was chicken skin or the skin of their competition), awesome skirt steak ...mmm...  Everything was deserving of the term ""delicacy."" Damn I want more! Even their soup and rice porridge with chicken and egg left me ecstatic.  Off the hook, high quality, authentic Japanese food (and very cute waittresses) makes this Y. toto worth the price.  My only complaint was that the portions are pretty small but I have the appetite of a race horse on steroids.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yakitori-totto-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Must try dishes are the tsukune (chicken meatball) with sweet sauce, the sticky rice balls filled with chicken meatball, Harumi (skirt steak) yakitori, seaweed salad and the house made mochi ice cream. Everything is seasoned perfectly when it arrives, so it calls for effortless enjoyment. I wanted to order more tsukune skewers for myself because one was barely enough (since it's my favorite yakitori). So good esp. when a bit charred. The mochi is so soft yet holds up well and isn't your supermarket freezer mochi. Yum. Their fried chicken (Jidori karaage) is great, but they serve it with the bone-in. A little hard to eat but worth the effort if you like Japanese fried chicken. Also, the fried shrimp balls are greasy but crunchy (from the shrimp, not from the actual frying) and go great with the ground ginger condiment they serve.

Hari K.,/user_details?userid=1A8IZE-9OwQm_4qVJy05uA,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",12/16/2021,2.0,"Painful review to be writing :( One time I had ordered the burrito for takeaway, and it was quite good! I was so impressed with the mock chorizo inside, and the sauce on top was so flavorful. However, this time, my experience through Ubereats was pretty disappointing. I ordered the Coconut Queso Enchilada - it looked like it was going to be delicious, however the cheese is just not perfected (too gooey + retains way too much of the coconut flavoring, that overpowers the whole thing). The mushroom filling also felt a bit undercooked. I also ordered their birria tacos (and was so excited to try it!) - it was a creative dish and I was impressed with how much they stuffed in. While the broth was quite good, the tacos itself were too floppy + just not that impressive.

My boyfriend and I got the deviled eggs, the Carolina caviar, and the Buffalo wings to start and i got the dirty cowgirl cocktail and my bf got The Boot. They were good but not mind blowing. Then came our entrees which were the pork spare ribs and the beef ribs. Both were tasty but lacking in sauce. Overall, food was good but not outstanding. Service was also okay, when they came to attend us they were kind and polite but they rarely came and they took ages to get us the check. It seemed that the servers were spread pretty thin so maybe it could be chalked up to the fact that we are here before the grand opening. Lastly, the ambiance was fun and lively and I enjoyed the restaurant vibes themselves. I feel that this place is good if you're looking to spend some money on some okay barbecue but it's definitely not top tier when it comes to the food which is the most important aspect in my opinion.

So...after speaking with the owner & finding that their 'official' opening is early April with the full menu...there's a lot to look forward to.

Good drinks and super nice staff *also* considering they are new. Wings were also very good. Might have given 4 stars but went for 5, just for effort and the quality of the food so far.

I understand why certain businesses do that but there are other restaurants in the neighborhood that are owned by a families (not restaurant groups) and they don't add a surcharge. If they're going to do that, they should let customers know by printing a message on the menu and on their website. For me, the only plus was the location and the music.

For a group of five, it was explained to us that the minimum was 2 x the pre fixe menu, plus 3 a la carte meats. We chose the three cheaper ones. We each spent $75 after tax and tip. The waiter was also really weird about giving us a few more leaves of lettuce.

Everything was tasty and high end. Even the tableware was high quality I must say. One thing that isn't great is how pricey everything is. I ordered some extra lettuce to wrap the meat and other stuff without realizing it was 8 dollars for a few slices of lettuce which is a bit ridiculous. But besides that, service was great and the quality of food was excellent.

Yaranny R.,/user_details?userid=fwVTwlU3M7UAzbeQRnflkA,"New York, NY",1/26/2023,5.0,"If you've ever been to the Michelin-starred Korean Steakhouse COTE , ATTI gives a similar vibe. I loved the décor, and of course, the food! To start, my career is in facilities management, so I immediately notice how spaces look and make me feel. You should know I'm a slut for good millwork and lighting, and the wooden slat wall panels and lighting caught my eye immediately. My table ordered the oysters to start and the Chef's 4 selected cuts as our entrée. In Korean BBQ fashion, the meats came with several small sides called banchan, which included kimchi, egg souffle, bean sprouts, lettuce, and a variety of sauces (to name a few). The meats were grilled table-side and all tasted high-quality, and were well seasoned. We ended off with their bingsoo- shaved ice with red bean. The entrée was $64 a person and I think this was a great value for all it came with. My paloma cocktail was pretty but did not taste that great... but it was also the only drink I ordered. I'd still give ATTI a 5/5 as all the meats and sides were perfect, along with the vibe.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/atti-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The meats were mostly really good - we got the premium menu as well as the other two cuts that didn't come with the menu so that we could try all the different cuts. I would recommend all of them aside from the filet mignon which was too lean. They have someone grilling it for you so you don't need to do it yourself but make sure you tell them how you like the meats cus the person who did ours kinda overcooked some of the meats until we told him. It was kinda expensive - they don't give you free vegetables (ssam and scallion salad) like all other kbbq places I know. Each was 8 dollars for a few leaves which is pretty crazy. Can we just bring our own vegetables?,https://www.yelp.com/biz/atti-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The place had people but there were a decent amount of tables for 2 available. Upon entering, I was not greeted by anyone. The workers just kept walking past me. I waited a good ten minutes because that is how long it took my friend to meet me at the restaurant. When my friend arrived, someone FINALLY came to asked how many people. To me personally, this is just unacceptable. FYI, other people they came in got greeted and sat within 1 minute. A lady came over to take our order but she didn't bother to take the menu away after we order. I got the French toast which cost $21. Personally, I have a sweet tooth but this French toast was way too sweet. I had to removed some of the cream on it because I just couldn't handle it. My friend got the chicken waffles and she said the chicken was too oily ($21). Overall, I would not recommend this place. Nothing was special for the brunch menu.

We ordered about 9 dishes and loved how diverse and delicious they all were. My personal favorite dish was the soy caramel wings which reminds me of Korean fried chicken, super crispy and flavorful outer and juicy inner meat. We also had the seaweed chips, rosé soba, salt and pepper cauliflower poppers, bulgogi ribeye, spicy garlic shrimp, grilled lemongrass chicken, crispy pork belly in coconut milk, and ube lava cake. All were amazing but just wish the portions were bigger as the price of each dish was over $20. Felt more like tapa-style dining bc the entrees were smaller than expected. Not to say the food wasn't good though! Additionally, the restaurant indoor space was very nice, clean, and organized including the decor which was simple and pleasant to look at. Our waiter and waitress was super attentive and helpful in getting what we needed.

Definitely an underrated gem in The area. They have a super cute outdoor garden seating, and since we went during the fall we were able to enjoy the outdoors, which was lovely. The food was divine. Starting from the Passion fruit mimosas to the Argentina coffee to the empanadas we ordered as an app to the entrees of steak and eggs breakfast wrap and huevos rancheros! No one had any complaints! The food was perfection! Authentic Argentina food and great service as well! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the area.

Emily R.,/user_details?userid=bFrZGWhy3AEpGoSRP7HoiQ,"Brooklyn, NY",12/10/2017,4.0,I came here with my husband for his birthday. We had a favorite Argentinian restaurant in Queens but it closed down and we hadn't found a replacement. We went today at 4pm for dinner. It was empty but the bartender did tell us Saturday's are busy so if we want to come we should make a reservation. Place is like most places in the area kind of small.  We ordered the beef and chicken empanadas. Guys the empanadas were amazing seasoned and so tasty. Then we had the entraña with rice and beans with side of yuca mash. The entraña was perfect. They give you the chimichurri in a small jar. It was perfect. Tasty and great texture. The yuca mash was ah-may-zing!!!! You must order it. The reason I gave it four instead of 5 was because the rice and beans was bland. Rice tasted like It's I don't like steamed. And beans eh. When I go again I would just get the yuca mash. The pisco sours were good. Flan was tasty but a lil dry compared to what I'm used to.  The staff was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be returning.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-mate-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

For mains we shared the churrasco and the sausage/sweetbreads plate which came with blood sausage, chorizo and potato salad. The sweetbreads were amazing and the chorizo. I wasn't a fan of the blood sausage and the potato salad lacked flavor. We also shared a side of the sweet potato mash which was great as well. It was definitely a great amount of food for 2 people.

Lenore P.,/user_details?userid=6T2m1LanbAw1uoBOzC2kDg,"Brooklyn, NY",1/2/2018,4.0,"On a cold Friday evening my boyfriend and I were greeted by a warm staff in a warm and cozy room. We were informed on the specials of the day and given bread with a DELICIOUS chimichurri sauce, as well as an eggplant spread, which was also good. We started off with 2 red sangria's and 2 empanadas (one beef and one ham & cheese). The 2 empanadas were perfect for sharing as an appetizer and they were VERY good! The dough was perfectly cooked, flaky, and delightful. I didn't care for the red sangria at all, neither did my boyfriend, but he decided he'd take one for the team and drink both of them. I asked for the cocktail menu and the staff noticed that my sangria glass was still full. I did express that I did not care for it when they asked me and they kindly did not charge us for it at the end of the meal. After my bf finished off both sangria's, he had a wonderful glass of Malbec. For my main meal I had the skirt steak and yucca mash. BOTH were out of this world!!!!!! Especially after I smeared several spoon fulls of their chimichurri sauce all over my perfectly cooked, melt in my mouth, steak. BELIEVE the hype on their yucca mash people!!!! BELIEVE...... My sweetie had their steak ""special"" with merlot mushrooms, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. He was VERY jealous of my yucca mash after tasting his potato mash. Not that they were bad...., the yucca just has that extra special something going on...I detect cheese, has to be the cheese.... Mmmmmm..... For dessert I had the panna cotta (with a cafe con leche) and it was creamy and delectable (coffee was great too!). My NUMBER ONE suggestion to them though is that they ADD a chocolate dessert to their menu. 9 out of 10 people LOVE chocolate and it is ALWAYS the perfect way to end any meal. My boyfriend didn't have any dessert at all because of the lack of chocolate options. All in all El Mate is a KEEPER for us and a romantic place for any couple to reconnect over great cocktails, wine, and amazing food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-mate-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Aubrey B.,/user_details?userid=t9xhkEkOWAeyRVNaBBo0xA,"Arlington, TX",6/5/2016,5.0,"This is my favorite restaurant I have ever been to. I ordered the empanadas as an appetizer. Picadillo and chicken. They were both amazing but the Picadillo was my favorite. So flavorful and the outside crust was so perfect! I ordered the strip steak after asking my waitress which she preferred: the strip or the rib eye. I am SO glad I did. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had. It was cooked to medium rare perfection. It had a nice outside crust but the middle was still red. It was so tender and the juice that's formed on the sizzling skillet is TO DIE FOR. I got a side of black beans and rice which were an awesome contrast to the steak and cleansed my pallet. When I first sat down, The Girl from Impenama came on and they continued to play all of my favorite Brazilian jazz all night. When I asked the waitress about the music she said she would go ask the owner. The owner then came out and shook my hand and we talked all about the music and where I was from and it was all just so amazing. It's an absolutely beautiful restaurant. Oh!

There was nothing amazing about this place, it really was all about the view and that is what you are really paying for.

Worse than the atmosphere, the drinks, and our service, was the charcuterie board. I am APPALLED. It was more than $30 and took over 30 minutes to arrive and I can't even begin to describe how not fresh everything on it was. Part of me thinks the waiter took so long to bring it out after he brought us the wine because he wanted us to be tipsy when eating it, so that we didn't notice how old everything was. The meats we're not even edible... they had clearly been sitting opened in the refrigerator for weeks. The ends of it we're hard and beginning to peel. The cheeses tasted off, it came with a few mixed nuts (mostly peanuts) from a CVS tin. It came with stale rye bread, maybe toast it or something? The grapes were nasty.

Robin T.,/user_details?userid=_FFwWvMzCJVmRHXvkBmQ7w,"New York, NY",9/20/2021,4.0,"Cam here on a Tuesday afternoon around 1pm hoping to get a table for 2 and it was relatively empty, with only 1 person eating inside, and 2 small groups outside. We sat outside and the views of the pier were lovely, I am glad that it is covered just in case there's inclement weather. I forgot our waiter's name, but he was very friendly and helpful, making jokes and even bringing out a small dessert after I told him that it was my bf's birthday. My one gripe with city vineyard is how limited their Lunch menu is. It only has a small fraction of what you see for dinner and the only entrees are a burger, a chicken sandwich, and 1 other item. We both opted for the fried chicken sandwich and it was very delicious. One of the crispiest chicken sandwiches I've had in a while. The fries were done to perfection as well. I didn't love my cocktail (forgot the name), so maybe next time I will just stick to wine. Overall, enjoyable lunch , I just wish they would expand their lunch menu. It's a very pricey meal, so more options would've made me feel better about what I paid in the end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

When we arrived we saw a small line formed for temperature checks, however they were still seating people pretty quickly. Once we got to the hostess we were shown to a table in the back with a river view. The majority of the tables were filled and it looked like we had come during a rush. Regardless we were given menus and water and allowed time to look over the menu. I ordered the city vineyard burger ($16) while my girlfriend got the crispy chicken sandwich (15).

L M.,/user_details?userid=s9ZA8ZQbTgzs1ez7ZCEOzg,"Chicago, IL",6/5/2022,2.0,"Terrible service!!! Gorgeous Saturday afternoon. Walked to the Pier and this place is pretty crowded. Lots of bros and Instagram crowd looking people. But whatever - you find that everywhere and I just wanted a drink on a beautiful summer day. Got a table right away with my dog (kudos for being dog friendly). A server (not my server) also brought a water bowl for dog right away (again kudos). For this - 1 star. Things started to go downhill from there. We ordered a couple of drinks and informed the server that we would probably only do a few drinks and not food. She abruptly told us that downstairs was ""full service"" only (a laughable concept as you'll see), and drinks only were upstairs so she could close our tab and we could move upstairs. This is a stupid rule IMO because this place isn't fine dining. I'm not stealing a table from people that are gonna spend $$$$$ on food. Everyone knows drinks are the money maker so if we have 4-6 drinks total, guarantee we're spending more than lots of people here getting food and maybe non alcoholic drinks or cheap drinks. But regardless, we're pretty laid back people - no problem, I said. We'll get some drinks and an app. Everything went downhill from there. We got our palomas. Even ordered a bottle of sparkling water to make sure we were spending enough to justify our existence there. Ordered tuna tartare. After that, our server literally walked by us maybe 20 times and never checked in on us or asked us if we needed anything. I mean, we didn't even get silverware or plates for the tuna tartare!!! And yes, I did try to make eye contact and raise my hand as she walked by but I wasn't going to tackle her to get some acknowledgement. It was completely absurd. Full service???? You have to eat if you sit on the ground level - but don't expect full service! At least not from our server. I would have ordered more drinks too. The drink and food (that I had to eat with my hands) were actually fine - 1 more star for that. But the service was so absurd, I can't imagine why you'd come here unless you are a desperate bro or desperately need material for your Instagram account.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They just started showing movies on their roof during warmer months. Or I just found out they do this. I came in recently to see Clueless and it was an alright experience. People were communal and willing to share tables for our party of three. There isn't a lot of beer (2 light beers) on draft, which is your cheapest option - $10, a few bottled beers and ciders. The wine is what gets me at being marked up to $14. I believe all of their wine on the roof is even on tap. My pinot noir was cold and just unremarkable. It also wasn't worth $14 to me in my opinion as I had just come from Morton's and the happy hour pinot noir there was even light years better for half the price. I'm unsure if they have a happy hour. It's listed as a menu online but other reviewers say there is none. It may be a bit crowded but more worth your value to try more wines earlier in the evening at a reasonable price if that's the case.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Then, as we were ordering we were told they didn't have any flatbread pizzas which is one of the main foods on the menu. When our food came out it was cold, my friend ordered the chicken and waffles and the waffles were uncooked in the centers and had to be sent back after he took one bite.

They had takeout only as we are currently in the COVID pandemic. The menus were in multiple areas and we ordered and paid for our food all online. Food took about 10-15 minutes. We ordered 2 burgers (came with fries) and a pitcher of margaritas. First off the container they put the margaritas in was so cool and travel friendly (again we were on bikes) and the burgers were packaged perfectly. We took our food and found a nice spot in battery park on the grass. Cracked open the food and the burger was large and juicy, fries were delicious as well!

Robert M.,/user_details?userid=9MWp0ecDA1DKl8nGigKBng,"New York, NY",7/16/2020,5.0,Our first time at City Vineyards was a smashing success! Matt P was our waiter and gave us 5 star service! He recommended the chicken sandwich and the short rib tacos as well as the frosé. We immediately ordered all of his recommendations and we loved them all!

Stephanie H.,/user_details?userid=GUQ5Odz0dY_afWUEJOefEA,"New York, NY",8/31/2016,4.0,"Wine was reasonably priced for the area. The gimmick is the wine on tap from their own winery. We chose 750ml of Sauvignon Blanc this time and it was a good balance of dry and floral notes. We sat at the bar, which gets crowded very quickly. The views are great and I loved that they retracted the roof when the sun was setting. The staff can be a hit or miss. Some are really friendly and others are dismissive. They just recently opened so perhaps these are just early day hiccups. They also probably didn't realize how popular it would become with the surrounding companies around.

Sheena L.,/user_details?userid=0NfaswASA1V69QUO6xL-3g,"Manhattan, NY",8/7/2019,4.0,"Love this spot for happy hour after work when the weather's nice, but I guess so does everyone else because it can get packed!! The space is pretty large with a good sized roof deck, and the ground floor has a shaded outdoor area and an indoor area for dining. You can't reserve space on the roof deck (they take reservations only for dining) so it does get really busy and you have to go pretty early on a weekday to get a table. But if you can snag one, it's great. It can get HOT though, so just be warned. Yes it's NJ views but it's still nice to overlook the water, and you have a good view of downtown and the WTC as well. And if you're there around sunset it's pretty nice. They have a variety of wines, including wines on tap which they can still pour into a bottle, but they also have a full bar with some cocktails and beers. Crowd can be finance-y after work since it's across from the Citi building and a 10 min walk from Brookfield Place. But, I love the ambiance for a great outdoor spot that isn't a stuffy rooftop. Tip: If it's too crowded or too hot on the roof deck, the area on the ground level facing the street has outdoor seating that's still nice, is usually not crowded and is shaded from the afternoon sun! You don't get the views but you also don't get sunburn and you get a seat instead :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Our table was ready in 30 minutes which was faster than either of us expected, and we completely lucked out and landed a table outside with a perfect view of the water and skyline! There are additional tables outside with a partial view and tables indoors without much of a view - we thought we would definitely be getting one of those. We ordered another bottle of the Syrah Rose and had a wonderful dinner with the Caesar salad, brussel sprouts, salmon, and crab cakes. The brussel sprouts were so yummy with the feta cheese, and the crab cakes were delicious. The salmon was cooked well and came with asparagus. We were not rushed at our table and watched the sunset, finishing the meal with chocolate mousse dessert with cinnamon whipped cream (yum).

Geraldine G.,/user_details?userid=Yyms0TPNmdDC0KtIoMGcSA,"Queens, NY",4/28/2018,4.0,"No need to lament as Spring 2018 has arrived and it's time to imbibe on wine with a waterfront view. Offering a 270 degree of the Hudson River and the Manhattan skyline, City Vineyard is finally in full swing. The glass enclosed restaurant comes with a patio and a rooftop deck offering an unparalleled view. As for the wines, City Vineyard offers wines on tap straight from the barrel. I would however recommend skipping the wines on tap and instead ordering a glass or a bottle of Oh La La Rosè for whites and a glass or bottle of Castello Di Verduno if you favor red as to be quite honest, their tap wines left my palate a lot to be desired. Beyond the grapes, they offer beers in both cans and draft, as well as cocktails such as ""Hudson Skyline"" and ""Spring Street"". Prepare to wait at least an hour to dine here on Saturdays as this place gets packed unless you're only coming in for drinks. Here's the breakdown of my review: 5 stars for ambience, 3 stars for service, 4 stars for wine and food. Overall, I still give it a solid 4 stars because here, I get to sip my wine of choice while taking in the unimpeded view of the Manhattan skyline from the rooftop.

Frankly, we were expecting TGIF type of food. Boy were we surprised. The cuisine was inventive, delicious, beautifully prepared and presented. We started with a grape and manchego cheese salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. It was extremely fresh and tasty. We also had a pesto and ricotta cheese flat bread that was the best we've ever had; the cheese had a creamy consistency and the flat bread was the perfect thickness - crispy but not burnt. The fusilli bolognese was one of the best we've ever had - the sauce had the right combination of beef, pork and veal with the proper degree of sweetness and just a hint of lavender. The cocktail and wine offerings were extensive. AND, the views of lower Manhattan and the New Jersey Skyline were awsome.

The portion was huge but the whole salad was COMPLETELY drenched in Caesar dressing, way too overpowering and acidic. I was only able to eat about half of it. Also, the restaurant must have not thoroughly cleaned the rooftop right above the patio because half-way through my meal, a lipstick-stained napkin floated through the wood panels above the patio and straight into my salad.

Reserved a party for 8 people and we arrived early and checked in. We went to the upstairs bar and had drinks. When we went downstairs at our dinner time, they said ""didn't you already eat upstairs?"" They had already given our table away but they resolved the issue eventually. Then they sat us downstairs but the drinks we ordered upstairs were not available downstairs. Ok, fine. Took 40 minutes for appetizers to arrive. We ordered entrees and the chicken was bright pink. The waiter took the chicken back from us but he never brought us back out new chicken entree. Later on, we gave them the benefit of the doubt and went downstairs to the outdoor bar and had a glass or wine for $17.50!!!!

I'm not sure if they do table service here or if you're just supposed to grab a drink at the bar, but we ended up just going to the bar to grab a drink and then we sat. I thought that this was a little overpriced--I ordered the pinot on tap. Think it was $12 a glass, which was expensive given the fact that it didn't come in a wine glass--it came in one of those little clear plastic cups. But for the vibe and the river view, I think it's a good place to come on a summer day every once in a while. Good place to chill on the lower west side and has a nice view of the river. It doesn't feel like you're in NYC because you can see so much sky! :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Catherine E.,/user_details?userid=j7mArHHNXMwYUtb6XtUb5g,"East Hartford, CT",5/23/2019,3.0,"Stellar location. Cool vibe. Solid food and drinks. It should be a 4-5 star place. However, the service leaves a lot to be desired. We took a group of clients here for dinner on a gorgeous evening. It took over 45 minutes to receive appetizers because the kitchen was backed up. I do not think that is a viable explanation, particularly when the order consisted of chips and hummus and a cheese plate. Those should be ready to go on a busy spring night. Additionally, every time a waiter came to our table it was because we had to ask for them. They never brought additional plates, asked if we wanted another drink, or asked if we were going to order entries. It is a shame. As someone who worked in a restaurant, the service is a 1 star.... and that is generous.

I stopped here with my sister for a glass of wine and appetizers. We were told we couldn't sit out back if we didn't plan on ordering food from the bar. We said great we would like a little something to eat. The one hostess left and when she returned changed her story. Apparently, in the five minutes she walked away the kitchen had become too busy to make food. ""The kitchen is backed up 45minutes,"" she says. Okay, so we won't order food can we still sit out back? No bc those were food. We just sat somewhere else. It was so much confusion and unwillingness to accommodate. There were several families and couples that commented to us the same experience.

Thank you so much for taking my inedible food off of our bill. Needless to say I didn't eat dinner last night and the manager could care less. Don't waste your time with this place.

I made my order which was only two drinks and waited 10 more minutes before leaving after she forgot my order.

Timothy M.,/user_details?userid=GOSLDK66iRq6BOJZTuGqfw,"Washington, DC",7/31/2017,1.0,"Terrible experience. From beginning to end. I kept hoping something redeeming would come from what seems to be a charming locale on the water. Our initial greeting with the bartender left us with her shouting across the bar to find out what the vineyard name was for wines in question (??bartender at a ""vineyard"") after a ridiculous large tasting pour ,.. actually not complaining about that... we were met with disinterest and ignorance about the menu, after having to call the waitress numerous times to place a food order.   She didn't know any of the daily specials or any details about the regular items. After an hour we called her over again to place an entree order, long after our wine and apps were finished, and again had to listen to her hollering across the bar about what items were. Another 30 min pass  and she had time to text in her phone..( also it's not even half full) our entrees come and we ask to have some other wines. They never come and our $26+ entrees included a ""rack of lamb"" that could barely fill a slider with one fingerling potato and undercooked veggies with 0 seasoning and a steak that was ""black and blue""  it was so underdone..And trust me I do steak tartare all the time I don't mind rare , with soggy WAY over salted fries and more raw steamed veggies: even in the end when the bartender was deliberately asked to clear plates she gave a giggle and said "" just push them out of your way I can't reach them anyway"". I've never left such a minimal tip; and regret giving her the $10 even then. I'll go out of my way to tell people not to go here",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Steven B.,/user_details?userid=FVRGHTS_1T1pNtJO-mc02A,"Manhattan, NY",7/30/2017,1.0,"DECEIT & DISCRIMINATION: This past weekend we were shocked to find the hostess and manager telling our group of 3 couples, each with our own well-behaved 4 y/o, that they couldn't seat us together--despite virtually the entire dining room being empty on a sunny Sunday afternoon (the patio was moderately full due to the warm weather). Puzzled, we asked why they couldn't simply pull a few of the many empty tables together. The vapid hostess stammered a few words then said, ""Let me talk to my manager"". She came back and said they could not pull tables together ""because of reservations"" (again, the dining room was all but empty). Thinking there must be some mistake, I asked to speak to this manager--to which the hostess pointed to the harried-looking tattooed woman behind the bar who barked out--""Yeah, we can't pull them together unless you agree to our per patron minimum of $100 each--INCLUDING THE CHILDREN."" Everyone at the bar--and much of the staff--looked at her in disbelief. So, clearly, there were never any reservations or legitimate reasons to not serve us...we were being outright lied to and discriminated against. The $100 per customer minimum, the ""reservations"" etc. were just deceitful business practices simply because City Vineyard doesn't want to serve families with children (despite being directly next door to Pier 25, one of the biggest family destinations in Lower Manhattan). To think that a business in this day and age--particularly one doing business in stroller-filled Tribeca--would be so anti-children is truly unfathomable.  Sure, I've heard of a few snooty places in the city that aren't exactly 'kid friendly', but I've never heard of one so sleazy and deceitful that they would concoct lies and bogus $100 minimums to deliberately drive away families.

Danielle P.,/user_details?userid=EOwGCW1b8WcrbkcvA6YPBw,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",5/5/2018,1.0,"Made a reservation two weeks in advanced for May 5.. cinco de mayo. As I am waking out the door I receive a call confirming for the next day which would be Sunday May 6th. When I originally made the reservation I repeated myself multiple times confirming for May 5th and the woman confirmed it back to me. When I told the woman who called to confirm that it wasn't for May 6th it was for tonight May 5th she said oh I'm sorry were bought out. After requesting a manager multiple times, finally a manager was put on, which I doubt because this woman did not seem to care at all. She stated I could go to the rooftop but she couldn't hold me a table, even though their employee messed up. She kept saying I'm sorry I cannot do anything. Will never make reservations at this play again, nothing but a waste of time and clearly they do not care about new customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Now, I like French fries as much as the next person but no cheese plate??? The vineyard only serves the cheese plate to the tables next to the bar, not at the bar.

John D.,/user_details?userid=_udQR6kHuxGViyUJbR_bkQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",7/23/2017,3.0,Heard about the city vineyard from a few people. So when we went to go to grand banks and they were full we said we would try out city vineyard. Service was good. Unfortunately the wine pour was small for the price. We also tried the cheese plate which is 3 meats and 3 cheese chefs selection. Im giving 3 put of 5 because we paid for the ends of each cheese. There was no cheese on the plate. At $21 I though it was very reasonable but for a wine and cheese bar ok sure they must have had more cheese in their fridge.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Richard B.,/user_details?userid=Hk9_WGC5UkLrlcBNEEz5Sw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/17/2017,2.0,"Been trying to get in here for months. Always told no availability, even in a few weeks. Finally got a reservation. Ironically, the weather was gloomy and rainy. Sat inside. No big deal. Not many people inside. Greeted indifferently by two poorly dressed young women. Greeted somewhat promptly by a nice waiter. Next steps were fine. First course of mussels and fries was ok. Needed salt. The bread for dipping should have been toasted. My main course, seared tuna over cannelloni beans, arrived over potatoes, no beans. It also had grape tomatoes in it, which was not in the description. I was not eating potatoes at this time so I called over the waiter. At first he didn't understand what was wrong. He caught on and took it back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, the two girls at the front desk were standing around eating. Tuna comes back over beans. It is now cut into three pieces and medium well. I had ordered it rare. The dish also contained fennel, which again was not in the description. I'm not a fan of fennel but I didn't say anything to the waiter. I just picked it out and left it very visible on the edge of the plate. My dinner companion ordered duck over puréed parsnip. Parsnips were lukewarm and the duck needed more of the fat rendered. We decide to share a dessert and ordered a chocolate hazelnut cake. Out came a scoop of chocolate ice cream and what could have been coffee or hazelnut ice cream. Called the waiter over and asked what is going on in the kitchen? He took it back and apologized. The ""cake"" came out but it was more of a moose on top and of a wafer but it was tasty. Overall our waiter was good and apologetic. None of this was his fault. As we left, those two girls at the front desk were nowhere to be found. So we left without so much as a good night. Final summation: enter at your own risk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

John S.,/user_details?userid=HPvQJRmd6OzPWxEJG2_oXA,"New York, NY",8/28/2017,2.0,"Lovely venue.  Went on a night without music; if there'd been some, it might have offset the poor service and disappointing food quality.  So, we sit at the bar for almost half an hour before we really get any service.  We ordered toasted nuts to nosh on while awaiting our dishes, sauted kale salad, mussels and falafel.  Tried the wines on tap - insipid.  Even their house-made bottled wines were only marginally palatable.  Pity, given they're trying to feature wines.  The nuts came out only moments before the rest of the food, even though they must've been sitting around available for quite some time.  The mussels were brought out cold; maybe they'd been sitting around, too.  They took the mussels and the fries and bread that had come with them back, and quickly had another plate of mussels in front of me, but sans fries and bread.  The latter took ages to show up, the bread too late to be particularly useful for dipping, and no bowl for the shells.  The falafel and hummus were passable, but I've had much better off errant food trucks around the city.  And the kale had been slaughtered in the pan; I've never had a vegetable cooked so much.  I doubt I'll be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Gail G.,/user_details?userid=BOSDYnwOIX4cc7UVJMXedQ,"Manhattan, NY",8/30/2017,2.0,"Came here last night for dinner with my girlfriends and was left more than disappointed. I made reservations on open table days in advanced to ensure we got a great seat for sunset while we enjoyed wine and food. Upon arrival I was informed that all reservations made are for inside seating only and if you want to dine outside you have to be added to a wait list upon arrival (which had a 45 minute wait). I was disappointed by this but we sucked it up and sat inside and watched the spectacular sunset and moon rising from there. Now onto the food. The french fries were pre-cooked and re-heated and it was obvious. Seems so simple to pull piping hot fresh french fries out of a fryer and serve them but thats not what they do here I guess. Their pizzas are a far cry from what you're expecting. Served rectangular and on thin, under cooked crescent dough, as a New Yorker I was not only disappointed but grossed out. Their Brusselsprouts are not to be missed however. I will always give credit where due and their sweet chili brusselsprouts deserve a call out. If you order anything to nosh on here while sipping cocktails make it the cheese plate and brusselsprouts.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Ally D.,/user_details?userid=awF1C30lmXHCz8NUw1x7ww,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4/14/2018,5.0,"I visited City Vineyard with a large group of friends to meet them for lunch and then head to the bar upstairs on a beautiful Saturday. While I didn't have anything to eat - my review is about the service. It was the first warm and sunny day since probably October so the place was flooded with people and you could tell that maybe they weren't prepared or expecting the amount of customers they had (which is totally understandable!). This caused the service to be slower than normal which would then result us to wait in the long line for the bar upstairs. When we mentioned this to the manager he was MORE than accommodating. He was so receptive and understanding and without hesitation or question led us upstairs through a side entrance to make up for the poor service. We completely understood that they weren't prepared for the warmer weather crowd, sometimes you just have to go with it! Thanks for being so great and accommodating, City Vineyard!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/city-vineyard-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jenna C.,/user_details?userid=7-W1HNGHhmfjsoCnXkOM5w,"New York, NY",8/15/2022,4.0,"My friends and I decided to get a pre dinner cocktail at Leroy's a couple of weekends ago - sans reservation on a Saturday, we had no issue getting a table for 3 outside. The outside is super cute - I love the style of their chairs and the plants really make the space wonderful with views of the action on Franklin. The inside is equally cute and I love the bar centered within the room - makes it feel like a nice communal space to gather with local friends. All 3 of us had the Double Derby and it was perfect! Refreshing on a hot day and an amazing blend of flavors. The presentation was also beautiful and an Instagram-er's dream. My friend had a craving for the Scotch Egg so her and I split an order. Amazing! The egg was perfectly jammy and a great sized pre-dinner snack. We snuck a peak at the dinner menu and it looked incredible so we made a mental note to come back for dinner and did just that last Saturday! We made a 7:00 pm reservation for 3 a few hours prior online. We were seated inside at a table behind the bar right near the kitchen - which was neither the best nor the worst. We still got to take in the amazing decor of this spot and I loved the grouping of plants hiding in the corner near the ceiling. Minus one star for the somewhat awkward seating location and very slow to start service. My friend and I both ordered the Double Derby again and our other friend had the Last Week I Was At This Other Bar per the server's recommendation - it looked tasty! He followed that with an equally delicious espresso martini. Our first round of drinks took an incredibly long time to reach our table - we saw them sitting at the bar on a tray for a while and I was tempted to go grab them myself. When they finally arrived we immediately placed our food order to avoid further delays. The three of us split an order of 6 oysters - they were tasty but on the smaller side. I could have easily done my share of a dozen. For dinner I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich and subbed the fries for salad. My friend had had it before and said it was just good. I definitely thought it was delicious; however, having recently been to Nashville, it was nothing like the hot chicken there so manage your expectations - this sandwich was tasty in its own way! I was also impressed by how good the simple side salad was! Greens with a light dressing, it perfectly complimented the kick of the sandwich (just a kick, I would not market this as hot or spicy). One of my friends had the burger with a similarly subbed side salad, and the other had the beef tartare with a side of Brussels sprouts - I tried some sprouts and highly recommend! I believe you can't go wrong with anything on the menu here and my friends and I want to go back to order some more dishes to share - it looks perfect for that. Minus the few hiccups, I cannot wait to go back to this cozy yet chic neighborhood gem!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/leroys-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The seaweed salad was soaked in a unpleasant overpowering dressing that's usually just a footnote with others so the sesame flavor could shine. Then came the shumai which was drenched in sauce and lacking in shrimp flavor. The bun. The bun, it was nicely moist however the chicken wasn't crispy and resembled more of a chicken nugget texture/flavor.

The noodles and soup were ok but the pork belly didn't have much flavor.  The place is small and crowded and a younger crowd. Music is on the louder side but you can still carry a conversation.  Not the best place for ramen in the city but for around this area, it is OK.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/zest-ramen-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Bryan E.,/user_details?userid=iyySqE-h85-NT8hTA5QrLA,"Austin, TX",4/5/2020,3.0,We went to Zest Ramen a few weeks ago. I must say I enjoyed my dish. I got the Spicy Miso Ramen. It was very good and full of flavor. The pork belly was tender and full of flavor. The ambiance is great. The reason why I give it three stars is because the other types of ramen that my GF our family got were not as good. They were eating out of my bowl more than their own. They didn't have too much flavor and were a bit oily.

Otherwise, service and  music selection was good, atmosphere is cute - small, but you didn't feel cramped, and there was a steady stream of customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/zest-ramen-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered their yuzu salt, tonkotsu ramen and takoyaki for appetizer. Their tonkotsu was rich in flavors and the right amount of fat. Their yuzu broth was out of this world good it was savory and light with a nice hint of yuzu it's a must try. The noodle texture was fantastic, it was nice and chewy. Their appetizer was also very delicious especially their takoyaki. The prices for their ramen ranges from $11 to $12 which is relatively cheap compare to other ramen shops in nyc as well as additional toppings for just $1 to $2 extra! They also offer extra soup for just $5!! And extra noodles for $2! Their prices are unbeatable as well as their ramen broths. I can't wait to come back and try out all their other items on the menu.

I liked that it wasn't overly salty where it could leave you feeling thirsty for a few hours after consumption. The thin noodles had good bite - nobody likes soggy noods, right? Egg was soft boiled perfectly. Pork belly could maybe be charred more so that the less lean pieces wouldn't make you feel as though you were chewing straight up mushy fat.

It was the best time to come and I highly recommend taking advantage of their happy hour deal. For the ramen, it was very filling and the broth was rich. The noodles were also good, along with the bamboo shoots and fish cake. If there's one thing to nitpick is that the pork wasn't as ""melt in your mouth"" type of deal you could get at a different ramen place. It's also a little bit on the salty side, but if you're on the sensitive end of that spectrum I think the spicy versions might help cut through that.

Christopher Z.,/user_details?userid=nwZarBtC6iof0fTihonDlg,"West Windsor Township, NJ",12/15/2019,4.0,"Was recommended this place by a friend and I have to say that I really enjoyed the options. I had the Yuzu Salt because I was intrigued by the description. The ramen had a very distinct zest to it, as I should have expected from the name, but they really nailed the zest down. It had a very strong lemon/lime taste to it, but they somehow made it work in a chicken broth base. This wouldn't be my go to ramen but I do recommend a try. The other ramen like the Tonkotsu on their menu looked very promising and I would definitely give this place another try.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/zest-ramen-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Julie P.,/user_details?userid=e6QrBzSEHS6WgnKCK05ETw,"Brooklyn, NY",5/14/2022,5.0,"Gorgeous restaurant, yummy food! I found this place last minute. Family was visiting us and wanted dim sum. When we arrived, I was a little hesitant about eating here because it was so clean (lol). I know that sounds strange but like all the amazing dim sum places I ever been to were chaotic and messy! Anyways, immediately we are greeted with the man who wears a UCLA uncle hat. He knew Filipino dishes so the first thing he offered my entire family was lugaw  (congee). The family couldn't say no - so they got some and they liked it. For our meal, we ordered the chicken juicy dumpling, pork dumpling, shrimp shumai, chicken feet, Peking duck, pineapple fried rice, and this beef noodle dish that I didn't catch the name of. Everyone enjoyed the meal taste-wise! I had ordered the pineapple fried rice, hoping it was going to come in a pineapple like the photo, but it didn't. That was the only upsetting part. Other than that, we're definitely coming back to visit! When I come by myself, I will definitely be ordering more than we did during our visit. I felt like I needed to experience more but we had all gotten full very fast! I didn't get many photos and took more videos... whoops! If curious to see my video, you can find it on IG at @ashrafeats. If not, enjoy the two photos of the Peking duck.

I grew up eating dim sum with my mom and going on trips home to Taiwan. This is my favorite location of the local chain and the best place you can go in the East Village for dim sum. Tim Ho Wan can not compare (like really, why would you go there if you can go HERE?). When I lived in the east village I would go here minimum twice a month for dim sum and now that I've moved out of the neighborhood I still go out of my way to go here once a month. I would recommend it to anyone. It's affordable and you can't go wrong with their dim sum dishes. I typically go with one other person and get their har gow, shu mai, spare ribs, xiao long bao (soup dumplings), and typically supplement with one to two other dishes. On the weekends they have rice rolls so I definitely recommend getting those if you have the chance. They currently have an indoor and outdoor area to eat.

Pricing is pretty good. People working there are very pleasant. Szechuan Spicy Dumpling has a nice thin wrapper and is packed with a very tasty pork filling. The downside is the sauce, which is gloppy and a bit gelatinous. They would do better with a really good simple hot oil. The cold sesame noodles are very basic. The scallion pancake has a better than average taste and consistency. We did really enjoy the shrimp shumai; which had a very nice amount of shrimp. Our two favorites were the shredded duck dumplings and the chive and pork dumplings. We thought they both had great taste, great consistency and a different spin on the average dumping.

The pan fried turnip cake bites were a bland soggy mess but the bits of duck it was stir fried with was tasty so I picked those little bits out and left the rest.

The logo outside doesn't help too much, looks a bit basic and tacky but when you enter the restaurant it feel different. Nothing too luxurious or special but it's clean, interior design is nice and simple. A pretty comfortable environment. Not super big or small, just a good size and several tables and it's usually not packed at all. Speaks both mandarin and English. Good service..friendly staffs, attentive, doesn't rush you, doesn't assume you speak Chinese because you look like one, and honestly pretty great prices. Quite a few different options for dim sum but they do have other Chinese dishes from appetizers, meat/veggies, to noodles or rice. A couple desserts and beverages too. Tasty food and nice texture. The Braised Five Spice Duck looks simple but tastes really nice and it's not too dry either. My friend wasn't a big fan on the bamboo shoot dumplings but I find it okay, doesn't have the ""wow"" factor but it's simple and light so good for the stomach. The steamed spare ribs w/ olive sauce was one of my favourite. Shrimp dumpling is like most places so nothing too special but they tastes good. Chicken feet was nice too. Shu Mai (shrimp and pork) was definitely my friend's favourite,:$3 almost wanted a second one. Is portion is perfect for the both of us. Not too big to be honest but if you have a large appetite it's best to order more dim sum or add some regular dishes from the menu.

Walk, no run, half a mile south for the real deal at half the price and avoid the $5 green tea that is free everywhere else in the world. Thanks dim sum palace for making me feel ripped off. For 2 small dim sum I could have gone to Kikoo and had all you can eat sushi!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-9?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Samantha E.,/user_details?userid=EVChLoqN0MyNBtYjFMkO5g,"New York, NY",12/23/2018,3.0,"I've been anxiously anticipating the grand opening of this new Dim Sum Palace location since the sign for it went up this summer. Finally went today with a group of friends for Sunday dim sum. There was no wait - it doesn't seem to have been really discovered by the neighborhood yet. There is not much dim sum competition in the neighborhood - Tim Ho Won is nearby but very overpriced. I thought that this place was good, overall, but lacking diversity of the menu and with a bit of room to improve on the dim sum. There is a 20% discount for dim sum right now during the opening, and a free dim sum with yelp check in, so I advise you to go try it before these deals run out. We tried several dishes. garlic spareribs were a highlight - dried garlic and chili on top made them very tasty. Also tried pork and shrimp siao mai - both very meaty and tasty. The Ha gow was good as well. The tiny pork buns could be improved - they don't have very much meat inside, mostly vegetables. And the soup dumplings were a bit low on the soup - mostly just pork inside. The green sesame peanut dessert balls were very good but the sesame balls were a bit undercooked - the dough was very soft and not as chewy as usual. I would return to try more dishes , especially if they add some more unique dim sum items to the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-9?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I live in upper Manhattan and this is a way better option for me than going down to Chinatown, where a lot of the restaurants I've been to (particularly dim sum) are not the most attentive to people who don't speak Cantonese/Mandarin and who aren't super aggressive and pushy since the restaurants are often small and busy.

The siu mai were delicious with nice thin wrappers filled with big plump pieces of shrimp. I was pleasantly surprised as usually siu mai are mainly filled with pork rather than shrimp. My favorite dish was definitely the egg custard buns. The buns themselves were fluffy and soft and filled with a gooey perfectly sweet egg custard. So good and definitely a must order. I might come back just to order these some time.

Christian C.,/user_details?userid=lvdp4s6m-hw5wFWJF1FRAQ,"Evanston, IL",12/3/2022,1.0,Don't understand how this place has such high reviews. Pretty bad experience start to finish. We had a reservation and they said all the tables were taken and tried to cram us in 2 barstools in the corner. They have you spin a wheel to order a wine (they don't give you a wine list) and you end up massively overpaying for a wine. The food was also bland and incredibly disappointing. The crab ragu pasta was just linguini in olive oil. Such a disappointing experience and waste of $200+,https://www.yelp.com/biz/spes-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Audrey M.,/user_details?userid=OyLn6Xngld6kZo5MfjcNCg,"Allston, Boston, MA",6/12/2022,4.0,"The secret is definitely out so make sure to get a reservation here! We tried walking in on a Friday night and while we expected a long wait, we didn't expect to keep getting passed over for reservations that were showing up literally hours early. One example: we put our names down at 7:30 and after we waited about 30 minutes, another couple came in and asked if they could be seated for a 9:30 reservation. They were seated pretty much immediately. This kept happening, so we eventually gave up and came back on a weekday night with a reservation. Food and wine are excellent, but reservations are a must, especially since they'll just seat you whenever you show up as long as you have one. They also wouldn't quote us a wait time, but just kept saying that they'll ""see what they can do,"" which was pretty frustrating since they clearly weren't going to seat walk ins.

From being featured in countless magazines and articles online for being one of the best pastrami sandwiches in the country to being featured in movies, Katz is a NYC icon. That being said, the pastrami sandwich is excellent. There is some level of customizability with the sandwiches, but I would often recommend to go with what the 'cutter' recommends especially if its your first time. The cutters will also give you a slice of the pastrami to try and if they don't feel free to ask as they are fairly friendly given how busy the restaurant often is. The sandwiches at Katz' are large and easily sharable so I would recommend splitting a sandwich between two unless you're famished. Outside of the world famous pastrami sandwich, make sure to try their array of pickles that come with the sandwiches. While Katz' Delcatessen may always have a long wait, it is surely worth the trip for an excellent sandwich!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Tbh I had never had pastrami before and was nervous to try it so I got the pastrami sandwich. I really liked it and the mustard but it still seemed like it was missing something for me. The sandwiches were big but I would say it's enough for one person if you don't get any sides. We got steak fries which were okay. I liked the sour pickles a lot.

Whether you've been there or not, you know it's  such an iconic place known for its legendary Pastrami sandwich. That sandwich was so massive,  t'was good for two people, really.  As you walked in, friendly staff would be by the door to greet you and give you a ticket. This ticket is crucial for them writing down what you ordered, so when you leave you show it to the cashier.  Akin to a cafeteria, there were separate counters for sandwiches, hotdogs and soups, sodas and coffee. Those preparing your sandwiches are called ""cutters""- Best to tip them before you order, for best cuts and maybe for sampling. I love their Matzo Ball Soup - so far the best I've had. My sandwich was very good, as well, but honestly, a local deli near my town could give Katz a run for its Reuben.

Appetizers such as dessert, blintzes & latkas with applesauce and cream cheese, are towards the back of the room.

I didn't understand the hype before I went but I always mention it to friends who are visiting the city! The meat is so tender and delicious.

I got one for the kids to share and it was plenty. I would have been good with just half a sandwich instead of a whole.

I don't know how they do it, but their pastrami is other-worldly.  We each ordered a pastrami Reuben, but served on rye, the bread got way too wet - so much so that I had to eat it with a fork.  My fault, but even if I couldn't pick it up, it was delicious.  We got sides of Cole Slaw (so incredibly good) and fries.  Perfect in every way.  Truly the tough part is finding a table, because even after people finish eating, they just want to hang out.  We did, too!  Cash only at the front of the store but in the back they'll take credit card payment.  Katz's was blocks from where we were staying, so we walked by it often - but there was no way I'd be able to eat more than 1 sandwich a week / or a month if I lived close by.  Incredible yes - but so heavy.  Loved every bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered French fries, a hot pastrami sandwich with their spicy mustard and Munster cheese, and some pickles. Unfortunately, the pickles weren't fully pickled. Everything else was amazing!

I gave my ticket to Cutter #7 and he wrote the cost of the pastrami sandwich with mustard on it and returned it to me. I tasted my sample Pastrami too. I found a seat, somehow, and started to chomp down. I'm a fan of the pastrami but not of the sandwich experience. There's no way that much weight can stay within the confines of two brittle and small pieces of bread.  Not that the meat was dry but I needed a soft drink to get it all down. I think my body was fighting back against pastrami overload. I'm not a fan of the pickle and they gave me so much of it to eat. I had not eaten breakfast nor did I have a need for dinner later on.

At the top of his list of things he wanted to do, eating here was one of them. We showed up at around 1145 on a Tuesday. There was a long line on the sidewalk and we were worried it would take forever. But the line moved relatively quickly. When you walk in the door, you get a ticket for each person in your party. Don't lose it. This is what gets you back out the door. You can go up to the counter and order and then try to find a place to sit in a large area with many tables. Or you can go to the back and be seated for table service. We opted for the table service. Our server was quick to greet us and quick to bring us everything we needed. They bring you a plate with two kinds of pickles. I only wanted a half sandwich so I opted for the menu item that was a bowl of matzo ball soup and half of a Reuben sandwich. The soup was very good and the Reuben sandwich was incredible. I have never had more tender corned beef, and everything was put together perfectly. Come hungry because the portion size is large.
