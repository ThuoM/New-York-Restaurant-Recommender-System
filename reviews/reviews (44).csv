We came here on a weekday night after seeing the immersive Van Gogh exhibit at Pier 36. We were looking for restaurants nearby, and this restaurant showed up on Yelp, so we decided to give it a try. We got outdoor seating and ordered several drinks (spicy margarita and red wine), two appetizers (tartine and soup; we wanted to order oysters but they were not available), an entree (duck), and a dessert (chocolate mousse). I like the cocktail, but the food was just ok. The duck was not tender, and the potatoes weren't cooked well. Even the sauce wasn't tasty. The service was very slow. I'm not sure if they are understaffed. We waited at least twenty minutes to just get the drinks, and another twenty minutes for appetizers. The whole meal took almost two hours. The server never came to check whether everything was ok. She took away the water bottle on our table but didn't come back with a refilled bottle until we asked her. The only time for the quick service was when we asked for check, and the bill came immediately. They do charge a 3% fee if you are paying with credit card. You can also pay cash.

The lemonade was nothing but tap water with a piece of lemon. No taste at all. We ordered the same thing again thinking the waitress might've gotten us a wrong drink. We also asked what's inside the lemonade, the waitress said it's literally water with lemon and some syrup... at least she is being honest about it. Do not try:( so both of the appetizers we ordered are pretty good ( tartare and egg white bacon toast). There comes the main courses which are the duck and mussels with white wine sauce and it was recommended on the daily special board. The duck was very good, soft and juicy, but when the mussels came, we all smelled something weird, and thinking was probably the fishy smells of the seafood but then when we were eating them, a lot of the mussels were actually spoiled and gone bad.

All were good except the mussels because the sauce was Thai curry and it didn't mix. For drinks we had a Cosmo, two bridges, and a glass of wine. I didn't enjoy the two bridges, it tasted really bad to me. For the main course we ate the duck and the cod. It came with a small portion of sides (no substitutions allowed) but we ordered more, such as, fingerling and whipped potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and sautéed mushrooms. The duck and cod were okay, but the sides were perfect. Best sides I've had in a while. The server was very friendly but forgot one of our orders. She made up for it by not charging us for a glass of wine.

Our party of six celebrated a birthday here last week and we enjoyed some great classic French nomz. Started off with some cocktails and then switched to wine for dinner. Our waiter was super on point from getting the air con pumped up to making sure we got all of drinks to making recommendations on food to just overall being awesome. Friendly service without being over the top is definitely appreciated! We ordered beef tartar, the cheese l'orgy (charcuterie plate), foie to start. Beef tartar was super tasty. I could have like five orders of this MYSELF. The foie came in a jar and toasted bread. Yummo! It's like peanut butter and jelly get in my belly good! The cheese board was very good and we enjoyed all the cheeses and meats that came with it. Esp the mild blue. I kept coming back for more. On to entrees. I of course had to have the duck confit. Whenever there is duck confit on a menu you bet your bottomless margarita that yours truly will be having that! Did not regret it ONE BIT. Flawlessly executed. We also had the lamb shank, steak, mussels and salmon. I had a bite of everything else and it was done well!

My friends and co-worker ordered warm apple tarte and belgian chocolate. The sandwich was delicious! It was good enough for me and my friend to share. I loved the creme brulee! It was really delicious and a dessert I would recommend. I had a taste of the apple tarte and it was really good as well. I didn't get to try the belgian chocolate. My friend didn't like it that much and one of my other friends said it taste like alcohol. But from their face expressions and their comments, it made me not want to try it.

It's a small restaurant featuring a large bar area, very nice hip atmosphere and traditional french food. Even though she was swamped, our server managed to keep up and was very helpful. We both ordered the roasted chicken, which was very well cooked and came with sweet roasted carrots and creamy (almost a little too salty but decadent) mashed potatoes. Got the creme brûlée for desert, perfect caramelized top- creamy and set custard. So why four stars? The place is cash only- but a main dish here runs for at least $20 a pop, meaning that unless you carry a decent amount of cash around with you, you are probably going to have to use their atm which surprise surprise will charge you a fee. It's 2019, if a restaurant is charging more than $12 for a dish I'm going to be annoyed that it's cash only.

Seemed questionable at first but the brunch we had was delicious. The croque madame was huge and so good! Reasonably priced as well at $13.

I was in Brooklyn for a few days visiting my friend from childhood and he took me to this lovely restaurant, which he says is his favorite. I see why. We sat on the back patio which was So Pretty. They started us out with bread (oh no carbs! #worthit). The waiter served it with balsamic and EVOO which, omg! I love it when restaurants do that. My date(?) Can I call it a date? Yes it was a date, methinks it was a date.. yay finally.. he took me on a date(screams in schoolgirl joy) . Anyways..so  then we got the French onion soup --which was good but, tbh I have had better. I don't know where but now I want to go back to double check that... He got the chicken, I got the mussels. He ate all his and so did I. He actually didn't care for the mussels, said they weren't firm enough.. *Kanye shrug* I loved em, the lemony flavor of the sauce was divine. I dipped the bread in the sauce and I ended up pretty full,  if I had opted for pasta I would've been way too full. Then he insisted on dessert, he got the key lime pie which normally they are out of. so I'll just say it twas me, I made the pie appear, I'm good luck ^_^ ...about the pie, well I'm not a key-lime-pie-girl but I had a taste, and it was high quality pie for sure... 5 stars, thank you SweetWater.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

If you buy the bass, the steak, or whatever protein, it will be soaked in butter which is how unskilled chefs at Great American Restaurants make things ""taste good.""  I have never eaten here and not had diarrhea for 2 days because of the butter. Tonight, I got the Southwestern Salad which turned out not to be a salad at all but a  rich salty, buttery, pile of what I would consider, more like salad dressing, that one could possibly scatter sparingly over actual greens to make something palatable and not waste it. I just go there because my kids like the place for sentimental reasons, despite that they get diarrhea every time from the butter food too. It makes no sense to me!

I had the lamb burger and I loved that it came with a lentil salad and a perfectly toasted English muffin, but the flavor just wasn't there. It was pretty bland. Thankfully it had a yogurt sauce and harissa sauce but still. It lacked salt. And the salad seemed to be completely undressed.

I'll be honest, when I saw the menu I didn't find it intriguing. In fact, I was debating whether it'd be acceptable to pay $19 for steak tacos. I gave the tacos a chance and they are by far one of the best tacos I've had in my life. The steak was perfectly cooked, the guac was fresh with the perfect amount of lemon, the green salsa left me wanting more, the queso fresco - amazing, and finally the corn tortillas tasted homemade but can't confirm that. It was so delicious that I went back the following week only to discover that the steak tacos were not permanently on the menu but happened to be a special item on that day I visited.

Ofelia E.,/user_details?userid=pFvJD_u68-FSvXKnluTDqA,"New York, NY",3/5/2021,5.0,"So glad I checked this place out last night, everything was delicious! There were no reservation slots for 7pm available but we decided to stop by anyway. They didn't have anything indoors available so we were seated outside in the front. They have individual compartments for each table with a heater in each, so even though it was cold we were comfortable. Still, make sure to dress warmly. We started off with the fried calamari and the French onion soup. The calamari was crispy and tasted fresh, paired perfectly with a side of arugula. The French onion soup was served piping hot which is exactly what we needed, it was so tasty. Lots of flavor and a good portion to be split amongst 2. Then we got the hanger steak and the Sweetwater burger. My boyfriend said the burger was good but nothing amazing. The fries however, he loved. I really liked my hanger steak. It was juicy and tasted really great for a cheap price. It was served with lightly battered onion rings which were fried perfectly and not stringy. Everything was beautifully presented and the staff were super friendly and fast! Everything came out quickly and they were attentive without being too intrusive. Make sure you also get their bread basket too with the olive oil with balsamic, so so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They immediately sat us in the back on a sunny day despite the that there were multiple tables available on the sidewalk. We order right away. They literally took 45 minutes to make a hanger steak, lamb burger, and baked fish tacos. Really!!!! We complained and did nothing.

Lisa T.,/user_details?userid=qUIA75NREG4dWb9uiGTp_Q,"Manhattan, NY",4/16/2021,2.0,Super disappointed in our experience here and unfortunately will not return. We ordered the rib eye medium rare and received a medium well/well done steak. We don't typically return food but requested a new steak due to how overcooked it was. Our waitress took it back but then another women came back out with the steak asking us to check it again because she thought it was medium rare. Very bizarre behavior to question a customer when it was clearly overdone hut we felt too awkward to return it again and just spent $40 on an unenjoyable steak. Giving 2 stars because the original waitress was nice and the other dish (mussels) we had was fine.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friends and I all ordered the chickpea curry dish with shrimp, it was delicious. Somewhat spicy, and it was similar to a broth or soup that we dipped the sourdough bread in, such a great dinner option. The backyard seating was very cute, and so photo worthy.

My boyfriends mother got it and I really regretted not getting it over my lentils curry which was good but not nearly as good as the fish she got. Lastly the mussels were fabulous and we were all fighting over the broth in the end. Friendly service easy to reserve a table especially at 5:30pm on a Sunday.

Sarah, who was our waiter, greeted us in a timely fashion & took our order. My mother ordered an appetizer which was the fried calamari (which was salty) & it's sauce was VERY salty as well. My mother & I had the Sweetwater burger which came with a salad & fries but we subbed our regular fries for sweet potatoes fries & cooked our burgers medium, while my grandmother ordered the lentil burger. My burger was cooked to perfection, I honestly loved it. But everything else was just salty, not seasoned, but SALTY.

The gnocchi wasn't bad but I think it lacked the chewiness. It could use a little more garlic flavor. The mussels, on the other hand, were quite delicious. I usually prefer mussels in wine but this was soaked in beer, which I think brought out the mussel flavor even more.  The service was really friendly and quick Our orders came out within 10 minutes.

Gato J.,/user_details?userid=kYbOwxYGzAOrzQvWV7g5Cg,"Dallas, TX",7/3/2019,1.0,"Let me tell you what happened yesterday around 5 PM at Sweetwater. I was sitting on the patio and the resturant was almost completely empty. I had two friends with me and my dogs and we were eating and drinking when I became over heated and excused myself to go sit inside in the air conditioning. I sat a table near the bar and started to get worse and the room was spinning and I started sweating profusely. I was fighting to keep my eyes open and stay in a seated position. I waved for my friends when the door was opened to the patio becuase I felt at that point that I couldn't walk but they didn't notice me. The waitstaff of the restaurant were rude and I guess they didn't recognize me from the patio and kept trying to get my order and offer me a menu. How crazy is that?! At one point I politely asked for a cold wet towel one girl made a face and went over to a sink and got a paper towel that she ran under the tap. She brought it over and it was room temperature. I was very quiet and polite through the whole event though the staff acted like I was this huge inconvenience. The bartender acted angry the entire time and when she finally realised I wasn't going to order anything she asked if I was feeling OK. I told her that I thought I might be having a heatstroke and she made a face and walked to the other end of the bar. I guess they thought I was a drunk or something. I was having margaritas (watered down, very weak margaritas) on the patio earlier. But not enough to make me intoxicated and I was eating and drinking a lot of water at the same time. My friends finally saw me and came to help. I haven't felt right since then, even after drinking glass after glass of ice water. So I have just called and told a very young sounding supervisor what happened to me at her restaurant. She reacted in glib manner and seemed not to take me seriously. The entire event was very odd to say the least and I'm still not sure what to think about it. Was the waitstaff just young and inexperienced and unfamiliar with what being overheated looked like? I think its probably more to do with the waitstaff looking at customers as how they make money and not as people. I was very respectful and polite through the whole event and I have been going to Sweetwater for years and always tip well and have been a great customer. But I feel that Sweetwater is just trying to make a buck and if a customer is having trouble then that customer becomes an annoyance. My advice is go spend your money at someplace that looks at its customers as human.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My favorite part is the back garden. When we arrived it was occupied but very soon we got a table in the garden, so i was happy about that. Food was very good, well prepared, and there is thought into it. They are allergy sensitive and vegan friendly. No vegan desert though. Servers where polite and accommodating but definitely needs a bit more attention, water on the table before we ask, we waited for about ten minutes for water and then we had to ask for the bread. No salt and pepper on our table. They seem to be slow and tired, which i get, i worked in a restaurant for years. Just certain things should be no brainer, that is why we dine out versus staying home. Food gets 10 out of ten, if you add a gluten & dairy free dessert, you have me. But because i love the garden chances are, i am going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nice neighborhood bistro ambience, albeit busy. Not really the call for a quiet romantic evening, but a warm and friendly feeling and a charming atmosphere. Waiters working hard to make it work, floaters pitching in to keep it going. Our table sampled the fried calamari, which was pretty darn good and we're picky about that; light, fresh and tender; the surest clue that a restaurant has a high quality bar. We also had the onion soup with gruyere which won a strong nod, the sausage and bean soup was terrific, and the rib eye steak was outstanding.

Being Indian myself, I know how most Indian dishes are supposed to be made or when they've been altered for restaurants. Paisley and Chef Peter Beck stay true to the Indian dishes they cook, bringing traditional flavors.

I eat a lot of Thai food, and this ended up being one of the best meals of my life. To start, we had the Yum Hua Plee and it was ridiculously good. Similar to Laab, but a bit more unique. Delicious. For mains, we had the Gai Tod Had Yai (fried chicken) which was very good and came with some excellent sticky rice and two very good dipping sauces. We also had the Jor Rang, a coconut milk + shrimp curry which... I am still thinking about the flavor that this had. Indescribably good. And then I also had a Thai Iced Tea, which was the best Thai Iced Tea I've ever had. The ambiance was great, it's a cute little spot, would be great for a date night. They played Asian pop music in a cozy brick-walled space with nice lighting. The service was also excellent, very quick with the servers offering us great recs (everything we ordered was at their recommendation, and they didn't steer us wrong).

Other than that, both the food and service were far below average. The pan fried noodles were served in a simple soy-based sauce that didn't really have any other flavor. The roast pork was meager and dry. The beef stew tasted more like a simple meat-based broth than the rich, fatty flavors you get from a low and slow-cooked beef stew.

For what it is, it's a bit pricey but the portions are enormous which evens it out; I almost feel like you should share one noodle plate between two people. It's great that this place closes late, but I think this place is overrated. My most important tip is that you have to add the different sauces on the table to your noodles.

This place is CASH ONLY but if you didn't realize that there are several different banks in the area and ATMs, go grab your cash, you won't regret it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However, I was so disappointed at my overall experience at this place. First off, the service was terrible. The waiter came to us one time to take our order after like 20 mins (I had to go get her too) and another time to drop off the food. Water was also something that was not given to us, but I understood because we are in New York City. The food came and everything was so salty or super bland, there was no in between. We ordered a chicken fried rice and the rice was clumpy, with concentrated salty areas, it was not well stir fried. We even found a piece of raw chicken buried at the bottom. When I brought this to the waiters, they just took the plate and didn't give us a replacement and didn't take it off the check either. I had to argue with them to at least have it taken off the bill. The vegetable dish we ordered was boiled with no sauce or anything. I was sincerely disappointed in my experience here and I will definitely not be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Good amount of toppings. The only issue I have is the veggie being a little too raw for my taste. The price went up a lot as well as it cost almost 11 for .

For every noodle dish you order, you can specify the type of noodle and way it's pulled and cut -- regular hand pulled, fat hand pulled, small wide hand-pulled, big wide hand pulled, knife peeled noodle, and regular rice, skinny rice, or potato glass noodle.

Scallion pancakes had hardly any scallions. The fried tofu and vegetable ramen was mediocre and didn't have much flavor except the tofu which tasted like fried cinnamon cake. The only thing good was the noodles. My cousins ordered beef and said it wasn't that great either.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They have simple outdoor dining and take out is available via phone call or online. I ordered online and got take out - I ordered the Roast Duck Noodle Soup with regular noodles and the Water Crest. The noodles were chewy and delicious. The soup was a bit bland and didn't have a lot of flavor and the duck they gave me was all bones and basically no meat. All in all, I loved the noodles, but wish they had their noodles without a soup and just stir fried or like biang biang mein. The Water Crest was for my parents, but they said it was good. The place was packed and crowded, which is good, but also unfortunate for COVID reasons.

T P.,/user_details?userid=BmC6Qj1xHViRTHeopwVAsQ,"Fountain Valley, CA",12/30/2022,3.0,"The service was great with a very nice smile from an older lady who brought out the food. The pan fried dumplings were fine. We weren't fond of the noodle soups (duck/house special/noodle dumplings) as the noodles were too soft, the duck soup didn't have much flavor, and we didn't particularly care for the house special soup flavor. The pan fried beef noodle flavor was good with a hint of smokiness to it, but I didn't like the knife peeled noodles as others recommended. If you cook chow fun, you know that chow fun noodles come stacked and cut into uniform strips that you have to peel apart. Imagine sheets of noodles stuck together like that, but this place uses a knife to cut uneven strips off (like peeling a mango). Each strip has 2-3 layers stuck to together and was cooked way too al dente. I don't know of the texture of the other noodles to make another recommendation as I wouldn't want it soft like lo mein either.  I would say get the pan fried over the soup if you end up here. I wouldn't make the trek to Chinatown just for the draw of the fresh noodle. We later saw a higher rated fresh noodle soup place in Chelsea Market, but I don't think they have pan fried noodles.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There was also a/c in each of the private compartments so it was very nice, especially at the time I visited, it was so hot and then it rained. The heat and rain was no worry thanks to the box being secure from those things! There was limited compartments but I got lucky to get one myself. In order to order, I did have to make a phone call to the lady inside, telling her that I was inside one of their compartments and was ready to place my order. So, tip, if you do not get any help after waiting a bit, call them and someone will soon be out to take your order! The lady was to the point, take order, served order, gave bill,  then you walk inside to pay, then go. So, I gave their pan fried beef noodles a try. Omg, the flavor was simple and so good. I could taste that the noodles were indeed fresh! There was a chew to the noodles, however, the amount of beef was less amount than I was expecting. I may have to order their meat dish separately, along with the noodles, on my next visit! I would definitely be back and I highly recommend others to give this place a try!

This place is located on Doyers street so if you're not familiar with the area it can be a little hard to find since it's a twist and a turn off of a Main Street on a small side street that at times does not have through traffic and is set up with tables along the street and the street may even be painted. Anyway ... this is a no frills kind of place they stick you where they have room for you ... last time I went during a busy Saturday and was seated in the basement this time I sat upstairs... which I much preferred. Their noodles are fresh made to order and some of the best in the Chinatown area I think when going to a place called tasty Handpulled noodles you should in fact GET THE NOODLES you won't be disappointed.

The dumplings were, by far, the best I've ever had. The soup broth was perfect. Long after my trip to Chinatown I'll be thinking about the soup from here. Seating is limited, as in, there's like 6 tables but they do seem to turn them pretty quickly.

It is definitely a tiny place here where you have to share a table with strangers sometimes, however, it's definitely worth a try! I had seafood noodle soup with pull noodle, it's only $9.75. Good came out very fast, good quality! Since I'm dining alone, I got a little table by myself at the corner, which is good (not a big fan of sharing table). When you bite the noodle, you can definitely tell it's make from scratch and the texture of the noodle is very chewy and good.

All of the noodles are freshly made - you can see the guys in the kitchen making them. This really up-levels their dishes. We could also tell that the dumplings were handmade too. Everything was great. We got beef noodle soup, shrimp and beef  pan fried noodles, and pork dumplings. Everything was so fairly priced and the portions were very generous. We were only able to finish one of the noodles. I appreciated that in both dishes, they provided a lot of meat and vegetables so you had  an even ratio of flavors and textures in every bite.

We ordered the number 1 special combination hand pulled noodle soup. The picture looked good, with ample beef slices, beef tendon, greens, Squid, etc. Well when the dish came it was a gross case of false advertising. It was just tiny little slices of meet on the bottom of the bowl you need to dig for. The broth was seriously underwhelming. I had to literally use most of the condiments on both our and the neighbor's table to fix that broth. The noodles were just ok. It didn't really taste hand made, but factory or mass produced.

You grab menus at the front, seat yourself, serve yourself water from the water containers or grab a soda from the fridge and patiently wait for the staff to come around to take your order. You have the option of choosing from a variety of hand pulled noodles!! I'd suggest just sticking with the noodle soups or pan fried noodles. Everything else is overpriced Chinese food ($16 for sesame chicken that you can get for $8 in any other neighborhood). The soup dumplings tasted like they were frozen, pre-made and then warmed up. I suggest the pan fried fat HP ND noodles with shrimp. That dish has the most flavor, almost similar to lo-mein. I often find their other noodle and soup dishes to be a bit bland. Overall, the most attractive thing about this place is the price. You can fill up on a dish for as low as $8!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Catherine Z.,/user_details?userid=jFODWWzii-4WR67Lzhvujg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11/24/2020,3.0,"Was overall a bit disappointed by this place. I'll start with the pros. The fried shrimp and vegetable dumplings were incredible! Maybe the best dumplings I've had in the city. What makes these dumplings so unique are the skins. They're lightly pan fried so that they're crisp, yet still chewy and almost a little bouncy and not at all greasy. We also got cucumber with beef tendon which was good. The flavors were a good mix of vinegar, soy sauce, and Szechuan spiciness, although I think I would've liked more of each of those flavors. It was a bit overpriced ($16), which I would expect from a nicer place. I actually found the ambiance of the place rather charming; it's definitely a hole in the wall place and when I walked in, there was an older man hand making dumplings. They were also very creative with their outdoor seating, they essentially built these tiny outdoor wooden shacks. Now for the cons. The 2 noodle soups we got (mixed beef noodle soup and roast duck noodle soup) were sorely lacking in flavor. The broth taste rather bland and I truly can't even name any flavors it had. This is such a letdown because I feel like broth is the most important component of Asian noodle soups. The meats were good. Unfortunately they didn't ask us what kind of noodles we wanted and just brought us rice noodles, so we weren't able to try the knife cut noodles. I'm surprised this place gets so much attention for the noodles, maybe I should've tried the pan fried noodles instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tasty-hand-pulled-noodles-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The food is awesome, totally shareable and huge, portionwise. I tried the pan fried chicken & shrimp knife peeled noodles, duck and noodles in broth (forget the name) and fried pork and chive dumplings. It was more than enough for three people.
