When we arrived, I was a little hesitant about eating here because it was so clean (lol). I know that sounds strange but like all the amazing dim sum places I ever been to were chaotic and messy! Anyways, immediately we are greeted with the man who wears a UCLA uncle hat. He knew Filipino dishes so the first thing he offered my entire family was lugaw  (congee). The family couldn't say no - so they got some and they liked it. For our meal, we ordered the chicken juicy dumpling, pork dumpling, shrimp shumai, chicken feet, Peking duck, pineapple fried rice, and this beef noodle dish that I didn't catch the name of. Everyone enjoyed the meal taste-wise! I had ordered the pineapple fried rice, hoping it was going to come in a pineapple like the photo, but it didn't. That was the only upsetting part. Other than that, we're definitely coming back to visit! When I come by myself, I will definitely be ordering more than we did during our visit. I felt like I needed to experience more but we had all gotten full very fast! I didn't get many photos and took more videos... whoops!

I was excited to come here due to the rave reviews, but I found the dim sum dishes average. Ordering consists of checking off what you want on the menu. The chicken feet were cut into smaller pieces than other restaurants and seemed thinner. This dish comes with peanuts, so be aware if you are allergic. I thought the turnip cakes could have been seared more so that it has a crispier edge. There was too much oyster sauce on them.

Grace Y.,/user_details?userid=WXOPvu53iSgej-w_0tnbSg,"New York, NY",6/21/2020,5.0,"I wanted to get stir fried e-fu noodles (yi mein) and the only place on UberEats that looked like they had it was Dim Sum Palace. I couldn't tell which item on the menu was what I was looking for, so I called them and asked them in Cantonese. They told me to order the braised e-fu noodles, and they would replace it for me with what I wanted. I also got the sichuan wontons, pork and thousand year egg congee, and coconut pudding. There actually isn't much dim sum on their UberEats menu. The congee and e fu noodles were excellent and standardly portioned. The sichuan wontons were a bit disappointing - the filling was too firm and the sauce too cornstarchy and gelatinous. The coconut pudding was more watery than expected and a bit too sweet but still good.

Tanya H.,/user_details?userid=EyxIGr0nzrPs-EwDYepymg,"New York, NY",5/29/2021,5.0,"The dim sum is made fresh here, and that makes the high prices worth it. It's not overpowering or heavy, unlike other dimsum places where it feels like you're eating buckets of salt/msg. I like that they make chicken shumai here, it's not a strong but comfortable and homey flavor. The congee has many big chunks of meat and pidan. The chashu bun is super fluffy, with yummy sweet meat filling. I would say that the soup dumplings have a thicker, chewier and less artfully folded skin than what you might get at a true soup dumpling restaurant, perhaps since this isn't a Shanghainese establishment but rather Canto. That said, the soup inside is savory and light, and you can tell the skin was housemade, it's still good. The auntie and waitstaff treated us well, and our food was brought out at a good pace.

This place was perfect. We sat outside, which is enclosed. It was packed inside at 1220p on a Sunday. You order via a menu with photos instead of carts. The food was fresh and really good. I would say better than Chinatown's Golden Unicorn, Jing Fong, and Pings. Dumplings are $2-4 more, but worth it.

Susanna M.,/user_details?userid=6bM_FqFaOzdwJQy8g_NuCA,"New York, NY",7/28/2021,5.0,"So, I'm finally reviewing Dim Sum Palace after going here since 2018. I grew up eating dim sum with my mom and going on trips home to Taiwan. This is my favorite location of the local chain and the best place you can go in the East Village for dim sum. Tim Ho Wan can not compare (like really, why would you go there if you can go HERE?). When I lived in the east village I would go here minimum twice a month for dim sum and now that I've moved out of the neighborhood I still go out of my way to go here once a month. I would recommend it to anyone. It's affordable and you can't go wrong with their dim sum dishes. I typically go with one other person and get their har gow, shu mai, spare ribs, xiao long bao (soup dumplings), and typically supplement with one to two other dishes. On the weekends they have rice rolls so I definitely recommend getting those if you have the chance. They currently have an indoor and outdoor area to eat. The service is great and the food is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-9?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The downside is the sauce, which is gloppy and a bit gelatinous. They would do better with a really good simple hot oil. The cold sesame noodles are very basic. The scallion pancake has a better than average taste and consistency. We did really enjoy the shrimp shumai; which had a very nice amount of shrimp.

The logo outside doesn't help too much, looks a bit basic and tacky but when you enter the restaurant it feel different. Nothing too luxurious or special but it's clean, interior design is nice and simple. A pretty comfortable environment. Not super big or small, just a good size and several tables and it's usually not packed at all. Speaks both mandarin and English. Good service..friendly staffs, attentive, doesn't rush you, doesn't assume you speak Chinese because you look like one, and honestly pretty great prices. Quite a few different options for dim sum but they do have other Chinese dishes from appetizers, meat/veggies, to noodles or rice. A couple desserts and beverages too. Tasty food and nice texture. The Braised Five Spice Duck looks simple but tastes really nice and it's not too dry either. My friend wasn't a big fan on the bamboo shoot dumplings but I find it okay, doesn't have the ""wow"" factor but it's simple and light so good for the stomach. The steamed spare ribs w/ olive sauce was one of my favourite. Shrimp dumpling is like most places so nothing too special but they tastes good. Chicken feet was nice too. Shu Mai (shrimp and pork) was definitely my friend's favourite,:$3 almost wanted a second one. Is portion is perfect for the both of us.

I just like to eat good food so ok, I am I guess. I've been to my share of dim sum places and this has to be one of the better dim sum spots. I've had some of the best dim sum in Tai Pei, San Fran, and in Vancouver, and this place come in very very close. First off, each dish was fresh and meticulously made. When a chef takes pride in his/her creation, it definitely shows and tastes amazing. My wife, who is a finicky eater, even liked it here. As with many NY restaurants, this place is fairly small but the decor and the ambiance was nice. Table cloth was a nice touch and the it was clean overall. I usually don't care about the ambiance of a restaurant unless it's a special occasion but it's worth mentioning.

Sandy W.,/user_details?userid=6kHuqVMxrF3zo8odrTjijw,"Providence, RI",9/22/2019,2.0,"This is definitely the worst dim sum place among all my experiences in New York for the couple years. To be honest, the environment is clean and service is good, however this couldn't help to raise the overall rating because their dim sum is below average. We ordered a couple dumplings to start, and the skins are too think while the fillings are all flavorless. We then tried the radish cake, and there is way more corn stretch than radish, making it soggy and flavorless. We also ordered the rice roll and the beef tasted dry as if you just heat up some frozen meat. No flavor again aside from the soy sauce. Their congee is also too over cooked that you can't really taste the texture of the rice. If you want congee, Congee Village or any other classic dim sum place in Chinatown would offer much better options. The congee is faThe best would be the taro bun and sesame balls filled with taro.

Samantha E.,/user_details?userid=EVChLoqN0MyNBtYjFMkO5g,"New York, NY",12/23/2018,3.0,"I've been anxiously anticipating the grand opening of this new Dim Sum Palace location since the sign for it went up this summer. Finally went today with a group of friends for Sunday dim sum. There was no wait - it doesn't seem to have been really discovered by the neighborhood yet. There is not much dim sum competition in the neighborhood - Tim Ho Won is nearby but very overpriced. I thought that this place was good, overall, but lacking diversity of the menu and with a bit of room to improve on the dim sum. There is a 20% discount for dim sum right now during the opening, and a free dim sum with yelp check in, so I advise you to go try it before these deals run out. We tried several dishes. garlic spareribs were a highlight - dried garlic and chili on top made them very tasty. Also tried pork and shrimp siao mai - both very meaty and tasty. The Ha gow was good as well. The tiny pork buns could be improved - they don't have very much meat inside, mostly vegetables. And the soup dumplings were a bit low on the soup - mostly just pork inside. The green sesame peanut dessert balls were very good but the sesame balls were a bit undercooked - the dough was very soft and not as chewy as usual.

The siu mai were delicious with nice thin wrappers filled with big plump pieces of shrimp. I was pleasantly surprised as usually siu mai are mainly filled with pork rather than shrimp. My favorite dish was definitely the egg custard buns. The buns themselves were fluffy and soft and filled with a gooey perfectly sweet egg custard. So good and definitely a must order. I might come back just to order these some time.

The sushi rolls are fine, but the rice isn't fresh (though I guess you can't expect too much from a casual place like this). The udon was also fine, but tasted almost like it came out of some sort of instant udon packaging.

The Ninja stick has spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, teriyaki sauce, egg, avocado and some kind of mayo. I was not expecting it to be as amazing and big as it was. While it is $12, the roll is the size of a hero sandwich like a big sushi burrito.

The proprietor was very friendly and you could tell when someone had come back more than once. He even remembered some preferred orders. He is a hard working man, and puts passion in his food creations. The most popular food were the ""Yummy Sticks"" which are essentially thin sushi burritos that you unroll from foil and bite.

The brussels sprouts were flavorful and did the trick to get a veggie fix.  Pass on the bing.  It is nothing more than naan and some kind of sweet chili jam. The meati nuggets were a tad spicy and perhaps should have been made with the sweet chili jam from the bing.  My favorite was the crispy potatoes with the notes of sour cream and crunchiness.  It was comforting and tasty.  Overall, the bites were a smorgsbord of ideas and flavors, some tasty where you want to eat the whole thing yourself and not share with your companions (e.g. potatoes), some where 1 piece was perfection (pork belly bun), some where you can't eat but 1 piece (meati nuggets) and some where the description and expectation were too different (bing) and the deconstruction dessert which was a disaster in presentation but you still ate it.  Go here for the view with a group.

Nigora R.,/user_details?userid=Jlq01yETUVzfeHiO-C1Rwg,"Manhattan, NY",1/21/2023,4.0,They sat my boyfriend and I right away. No reservation was needed that Saturday afternoon. We ate off of the restaurant menu which is a great value because it includes a drink and two courses for $45 a person. I had the best iceberg salad of my life. Typically iceberg salads have no flavor but this one did. I really like the sesame on it. The Palmer was a lemonade and I love how green it was. Really yummy. The waffle was average. It could have use more apple and more flavor. My boyfriend had the chicken burger which was a really nice portion. Feel free to ask for a knife and fork for that burger!Service was attentive but not overbearing.

Nicole B.,/user_details?userid=QxJ2YrfZtHjXurI9m3h9qA,"San Diego, CA",10/28/2022,2.0,"I was really looking forward to eating at Momofuku Ssam Bar but unfortunately had a very disappointing experience. I've eaten at his restaurant in Las Vegas and have always had an incredible experience. With that being said, the food was ok but the service was awful. We made a 9:30 year reservation and received a call around 8:30 saying that we could come by earlier. We weren't able to so showed up a few minutes before our 9:30 reservation. We were rudely greeted by the hostess who seemed to be extremely upset that we had shown up so late (at 9:28 for our 9:30 reservation). I understand people want to call it a night early sometimes but don't offer reservations at this time if you're not capable of delivering on the David Chang experience. So once they begrudgingly sat us, the waitress comes up and says kitchen is about to close so you have one shot to put in all your food. There's definitely a more customer-service appropriate way to say that...anyways we ordered the ssam set which was overall very good. Drinks were also solid. The meats were all good and I really enjoyed the salad. The raw fish dish, hamachi I think, was a little fishy but the bing and salad made up for it. The meats were all tasty and the star of the meal. We ordered the oysters which were pretty standard but the $55 cacio e pepe rice cakes were not worth the price tag. You could tell throughout the meal that they were trying to rush us so they could get out of there, which really deterred from the experience. Once again, I know everyone is tired and overworked but we're pretty low maintenance so I just ask for a decent experience when we're paying to go to a nice restaurant. The subpar service really put me off to coming back to this restaurant. Would not recommend it unless there's a turnaround and more focus on service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jane L.,/user_details?userid=_W1HZ_lW34YUjCIFIVrHFQ,"Queens, NY",10/24/2022,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this new iteration of Momofuku Ssam Bar. I was a big fan of the old location and appreciated how intimate it was and how it reflected the David Chang swagger of the other earlier Momofuku restaurants. That vibe is nowhere to be found in the new location. It feels like an overpriced tourist trap geared toward people who have a lot of money to spend, want to dabble in some gateway Korean food (and/or perhaps are not comfortable with venturing to K-town), and want to see and be seen. It looks like it was designed for social media posts. That being said, the food was decent. Our group participated in the full Ssam tasting menu and liked all of the dishes. Nothing was exceptionally memorable for me other than the salad (randomly). All of the dishes were very ""safe"" and not terribly exciting, but they were well executed. The service was good until the end, when we were asked to leave because they had to ""free up the table,"" even though all of the large tables around us were unoccupied. One other observation that I found to be somewhat interesting (as an Asian) was that I didn't see any Asians among the many staff members who were working there the night we went. I find that unusual for  an Asian restaurant, but perhaps this just happened to be case the night we went. Ultimately, I doubt I will return to Ssam because it just feels like a ""new Coke"" version of the old location, but I do think the overall experience would be enjoyable for most people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Clara C.,/user_details?userid=ux_IwqtckDUKinXCrUkrmQ,"Santa Clara, CA",10/24/2022,4.0,"This was another spot in Chinatown that I kept seeing all over my social media. When we got here there was also a line and my friend and I probably waited like 30 mins. Keep in mind this place is also cash only but it's super cheap, we ordered a small roast pork and roast duck and it was only $6. Overall thoughts on this place is their meat is good but their rice is a bit more soggy, I think they they cook the rice they added a bit too much water and when they pour the sauce form the meat over is makes it more soggy. One of my other friends went on a different day and also said the rice was also soggy so I think maybe that's just how they make it. They also have a larger option for a little but more but my friend and I just wanted to share the small one. I think it's good to try this spot, for the meat and not the rice!

We had roughly 5 people in front of us that took a while since they were ordering so much. I ended up getting a small plate - half char siu and half roasted duck since we still had so many places to explore after. My first bite was fairly solid - a good piece of char siu with rice covered in a savory sauce. The duck was fatty and well seasoned. Was I completely blown away? Not really - but it's still really good Chinese bbq. The price point is great and the amount of food you get is totally worth it! For that - it still deserves a 5 stars and I am super jealous of all the people who live in the area.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sometimes I work from home just because I'm craving Wah Fung for lunch. Once I went to the gym but one of the staff brought in duck for lunch which I can't say for sure was from Wah Fung, but reminded me of the restaurant so when I left the gym I immediately walked to pick up my lunch from Wah Fung. My favorite is the crispy pork belly over rice and a small is enough to knock me out for a midday nap. The other options are char siu, duck, and chicken. I've tried them all but there's something about the fatty pork belly with the crisp skin and slightly burnt edges that goes so well with the sweetness of the cabbage and rice.

So I decided to take pork($6.50) and chicken($6.50) large plates. They really not playing games with portions. They've huge. Chicken was slightly dry and a tons of bones were inside.

Candi K.,/user_details?userid=7BmJFB0R-7RIydtIJ8sJZg,"New York, NY",2/14/2021,5.0,"In honor of Chinese (Lunar) New Year we drove downtown to Chrystie St (near Hester) to fulfill my craving for char siu pork.  I asked my NYC Hong Konger friend ""Where's the best place to buy char siu pork?""  He told me Green Garden but I saw a big C on the door and balked.  I'm never trusting that friend again with New York Chinese food advice.  TC, I'm talking about you!  All I wanted to find was a simple, cheap, reasonably clean Chinese meat counter shop like Nam Fong in Honolulu Chinatown to buy juicy cuts of char siu, roast pork, duck or chicken.  Wah Fung No.1 in NYC Chinatown is that place!  We arrived late around 10:55am and there was a line to the street corner.  The shop is so small that only 1 or 2 customers are allowed in at a time.  At first it didn't move so fast (too many indecisive customers?) and we had to listen to firecracker music from the next door gift shop.  But we finally got in the door at 11:25am.  We bought a large takeout container of char siu pork (no rice, no cabbage, only meat!) and I had to hide my joy when they said $12!  They had to repeat it twice, I couldn't believe my luck!  CASH ONLY though so luckily I had $ in my purse.  There's one butcher inside chopping up your meat and another person at the cash register.  It looks just like Nam Fong in Honolulu.  I felt like I was home in Hawaii's Chinatown (the 2nd oldest Chinatown in the U.S.).  We were in and out in 3 minutes with our cherished char siu in our tote bag.  Wah Fung also sells ""plates"" of char siu, roast pork or chicken and rice for $4.50, but we just wanted fresh char siu to season our home-cooked fried rice, Singapore noodles or soup.  Beware however the char siu sauce is very sticky and leaked inside our tote bag (my husband was carelessly bouncing the bag on his shoulder).  It smelled so good that we couldn't wait to snack on it - rushed back to our car and ate the char siu on top of cilantro and scallion steamed rice rolls that we bought for $2 each from Delicious Huang Bakery around the corner on Hester Street. Wah Fung gives huge portions.  Good value for char siu exactly like what I grew up eating.  I only remembered to take a photo halfway through our feast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Hole in the wall, no frills, and everyone who comes knows what they are getting. They're pretty quick and calm and collected, and it's definitely a neighborhood gem. The little box I got was hefty but probably more due to the amount of rice.

Because of COVID they allowing two customer inside. Or always have been 2 people inside, because simply not enough space for 4 people. No Dining in space.  I already knew what I was gonna order roasted pork and duck combo for only $7.50!!!!! But many uncultured tourists need a lot of time to figure out what they want.  It literally says on the signage #1 fast food, but more of a must stop tourist hot spot with average wait time of 20minutes or longer.  When it was finally my turn to place the order there was one skinny old man and a young apprentice working together.  I ordered and got my food and set on the nearby park bench. White rice at the bottom and stirred fried napa cabbage on top of the rice and roasted pork and duck at the very top.  Nice crust textures on the pork and it tasted delicious!! Who needs fried chicken from Zaxby's;).

I did not expect to wait about a half an hour in line, but it sure was worth it. We got to try the duck on rice and the pork on rice. We are happy with both. The duck and the pork or such different flavor profiles and I am so glad that I ordered them both because though they are different, they sure to complement each other. The duck has a nice Crunchy texture that goes so well with a nice warm bed of rice. It's also very fatty and it taste so good. If you have never had duck I would highly suggest that you do try. This would be a great place for you to try duck as a first timer. Now the pork was very different. The pork was also on rice, but it also tasted different because of the sweeter profile. It almost had a candy like texture. And I was very happy having it. Unfortunately we weren't able to sit in the restaurant, so we took it over to the park and got to enjoy the weather and we even got to enjoy some locals doing some Dance or exercise.

You're probably asking yourself, what's the difference with the roasted pork and the pig? Well let me tell you. The roasted pork is a marinated chopped up meat which has that slight sweet taste and the pig is similar to a lechón and not marinated. I know going into this, it was my first meal of the day, and without that bias of starving, the food was great! The meat was juicy and tender and fresh. The rice was moist and slightly sticky. The perfect meal for a college student who has 5 bucks to spare and be  full of quality Chinese bbq. A must go in NYC! Bring cash! It's the only way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I got the duck and well just a heads up it's 5% duck 95% bones. The flavors were fine (not amazing), rice was okay, and the vegetable tasted old. I don't frequently eat vegetables but it's pretty easy to tell what's almost spoiled and what isn't. Whatever duck there was wasn't tender and cooked well enough either as it took a considerable amount of time to chew.

Leo Y.,/user_details?userid=FaqTnv6hKl35006S8OZK9Q,"Brooklyn, NY",11/13/2020,5.0,"This is a classic Cantonese roastery across the block from the end of grand St park. Back in the day you could find stacked boxes of meat and rice for only $5.00, but due to covid and inflation prices have gone up to around $6.50. It's still an excellent deal, nonetheless. The master roaster and butcher chops up a mountain of meat for each order. They serve char siu, roast pig, roast duck, soy sauce chicken, and more. My personal favorites are the char siu half fatty, half lean, and the roast pig. There's a wonderful crunch from the roast pig and a delectable sweetness to contrast the savory dish. You absolutely can't go wrong with any fish though. Everything is made in house, and for Manhattan it's an absolute steal.

Waiting on line made everyone eager with anticipation and the food did not disappoint. I ordered the small roast pork combo over rice, took it over to the park across the street and devoured the whole container of food. The only knock on the experience was that the food wasn't as much as I've seen in previous pictures or reviews. The amount of food for the price was fine but I guess my YouTube-hyped expectations thought there would be more pork but all in all the overall amount of food was perfectly adequate.

It was cheap for a small carton of rice, cabbage and meat (4.25 for pork or chicken and Duck has an additional charge). My siblings and I got pork and duck. When we came there was a line. You have to watch out Bc the shipowner next door will come out and sort of shoo you if the line blocks her shop. The inside was nice. You can see the workers cutting up the meat right in front of you. Taste was alright. The duck was eh. There wasn't much flavor and the rice was bland. The pork was much better tasting. It was sweeter and saltier and coupled with the rice better. Recommend pork over duck if you had to choose. Would recommend coming here. Definitely worth it for the price and a visit if you're visiting from somewhere else and want to explore different eats in china town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

That's what our daughter believed and we were there on her recommendation. As we waited the smells became more and more enticing and we viewed the roasted meats hanging in the window with mouth-watering anticipation. Finally it was our turn! The chef chopped the pork, laid it on white rice in an aluminum pan and spooned some drippings and broth over it. We eagerly paid and headed back out to the sidewalk to see if it would live up to our daughter's review. One bite of this incredibly flavorful, moist, tender pork with crispy edges, combined with the fantastic sauce and perfectly cooked rice was all it took for us to join Team Wah Fung! We agree it is the best pork in NYC! Maybe the world.

I would've liked to have a little more meat and less rice, but I can't complain for $6. The line was out the door, but the store is very small, and they move pretty fast.

They have the $6 for Meats where you can choose any meats you want either for porks for chickens or two porks or two chicken.. it's a dollar more if you want the noodles instead of the rice.

Jenna L.,/user_details?userid=c8Du5NCHQwEu-kGio1-4yA,"Albany, NY",10/6/2016,5.0,Wow. So good. My husband and I both got the roast pork with ginger sauce and my mother in law got the roast chicken. It was excellent. I'm not huge on ginger but so glad I got the dollop of ginger sauce on the pork because it was really excellent and added a nice contrasting flavor. The place says it closes at 6pm but they kept serving past them. There was a long line the entire time we were there but the two guys worked hard to move it as fast as they could. They do not have soy sauce packets so be sure to have some at home if you like that on your rice. The meat is really well seasoned and doesn't need it at all.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was turned onto the Roast Pig (which is different than the Roast Pork/Char Siu) by a friend and it is by far my favorite option there. It's all white meat... crispy, fatty, and full of flavor. It reminds me of really great southern barbecue thrown into a Chinese barbecue joint. All the right levels of crispy, salty, juicy, etc. My second favorite is probably the duck which is also super tasty along with the rice and cabbage they throw in.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Obviously, that created a very high expectation about their food. When I arrived on a Saturday afternoon, there was a short line of people waiting, but the line moved pretty quickly. I ordered a large size combo of char siu and roasted pork. After my first bite of the roasted pork, I found it very bland, but the skin was good though very crispy. After eating almost the entire meal, there was only one particular piece of roasted pork that was well seasoned, but the rest was very bland. Not sure if the chef did a lousy job seasoning the pig that day. The char siu was ok, I found it to be a little bit too sweet and was lacking the real char siu flavor. The only good thing is that this place gives bigger portion than other Chinese restaurants for the 2 combo. Overall, I was disappointed about the food. It was too much hype. There are definitely much better places out there in term of flavor and quality in Chinatown and Brooklyn Chinese areas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This shop have been around for years. Students and old timers love to come here for the $3.75 special of BBQ roast pork/chicken with rice and veggies. This is all day special. I just order the small box for lunch. The guy that works here is fast and efficient. He chops the BBQ roast pork and chicken so fast. I know his arm is strong but all the years of cutting may hurt his arm. The lines are long everyday. Yesterday when I went the line moved quickly. The owner hired another guy to help him with the orders. In the past it was the owner and wife. This place is still popular and affordable for everyone in chinatown. Good place to get comfort food.

Spending my childhood exploring Chinatown in SF, NYC's Chinatown definitely blew it out of the park with this little hole-in-the-wall eatery that was delicious and cheap.

The young man behind the counter is the same from years go and he's a real sweetheart. There's such a long line for lunchtime that the neighboring store's owner/manager was yelling at the poor owner of this eatery to move his customers waiting in line and blocking her store.

Vennessa S.,/user_details?userid=tTK8aOKhvBNGxbJFDFKLWg,"Chandler, AZ",2/19/2020,5.0,"Literally, THE best Chinese BBQ we have EVER had. We were visiting NY from AZ and came across a ton of recommendations for this place. We walked long and far to find it, stood in line for over 10 mins - out the door in 20° weather (cold for us Arizonans) and it did not disappoint! We got the BBQ pork and Roast duck combo, came with rice and steamed veggies for under $7. Definitely the cheapest meal of our entire trip and probably the best tasting meal as well. Me and my boyfriend shared this because we wanted to explore as many restaurants, dessert and drink shops as possible. There are no tables inside nor outside.

Jocelyn K.,/user_details?userid=AjrQR51BIpJ2ELxq4MjtWA,"Ridgefield, NJ",2/16/2020,4.0,"Decided to check this place out with some friends after seeing it on the Insider. There was a line when we arrived, but we waited around 15 minutes max. We got our food pretty much right after ordering. My friends and I got a large roast duck and pork belly ($6.50) Both came with cabbage, white rice and a few spoonfuls of their respective juices (yum). The pork belly was my favorite out of the two.The skin was super crispy! It was slightly too salty but the white rice and cabbage helped offset it. My friend said he was going to go back and get just the pork belly ($9). The roast duck was okay, each bite I had mainly consisted of bones with little meat so I was disappointed about that since my friends had raved about it before. I'll definitely come back to try the char siu and give the roasted duck another chance. All in all, worth the price and wait!

This place provides a generous serving of delicious pork for less than $5. I come here regularly when I'm in the area and will sometimes make a trip out from Queens for it if I'm really craving it. There's plenty of Chinese BBQ places near me but I'm more than happy to make the trip out. I've yet to come early enough to get noodles instead of rice but I believe that speaks volumes about the store.

Ling J.,/user_details?userid=KcQF4Pkfs_ZgdPBk61baAw,"New York, NY",6/5/2019,5.0,"I'm so hooked on the BBQ meats from this fast food restaurant. Oh well, it is more of a take-out. Even though it is advertised as a fast food restaurant, it is not what you think - the meats are roasted carefully and they are in the ready to serve status if you will. The store front is very small and you'd walk pass through it without even noticing. But hey you can't, you know why, because there is always a line. After this place was featured by several vloggers, it is getting even more popular, with tourists all over the world even. The other weekend when I was in line waiting for my perfect chicken, duck and pork combo, I overheard a group of tourists asking a lady behind me about the food. Unfortunately they asked the wrong person, or maybe the lady behind me did not want to deal with these tourists, she replied nothing special, just for a quick bite. No, she was 100% incorrect and ironically she stood in line for her meal after turning away the group of tourists. I feel so bad for the misinformed tourists. They completely missed a perfect opportunity to experience Chinatown and a tasty meal which are not available in typical Chinese take-outs in the states. Alright, let me speak about the meats. I'm sure by now you've probably heard that is one of the best place to get charsiu AKA Chinese roasted pork in NYC. But what most people don't know yet is their chicken is equally as amazing or even better. I found charsiu can be a little over sweet but the chicken is cooked perfectly. The juicy and tender dark meats are infused with cooking wine and soy sauce. And the crunchy skin gives extra chews and adds up more flavor. The stewed cabbages are quite delicious too.  It is so simple but adds so much freshness and balance to the meal. I'd be very satisfied with a small combo meal and if you are really hungry, a large combo will definitely fill up your stomach with only 7 bucks.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I've tried other places, but Wah Fung remains the best. The meat is always perfectly cooked, just the right mix of tenderness and firmness, with a great glaze--not too sweet or salty. It's also really nice that you get a bit of cabbage along with your meal, as most places just plop the pork on top of rice and send you on your way. At least here you can pretend you're eating slightly healthier since there's some vegetables on the side (though they really do help cut the richness of the pork as you eat). The chicken and duck are both pretty good, but my favorite order is half roast pork, half char siu pork. The roast pork has an amazingly crunchy skin, and combination of flavor and texture is impressive. While the occasional long line can be deterring, the price and quality of the pork offerings is unbeatable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The cabbage, cooked in the broths of the soup, is perfectly soft and flavorful. The grilled pork is perfectly cooked with a crunchy texture on the .outside and chewy texture inside. The BBQ pork isn't even remotely dry, as it is juicy with just the right amount of fat and lean meat. Put all of that over a bed of rice, and you have the perfect lunch box. You can get their special smaller size portion for around $4, or get the larger portion for $6. Since it comes with veges, it's a great alternative to the usual junk food at these prices.

I saw a video on youtube by Mike Xing Chen aka strictly dumpling. In his video review of dishes from Wah Fung he proclaims their char siu to be the best outside of Hong Kong and boy was he right! I have had char siu in Brooklyn and it does not compare at all to the char siu at Wah Fung. My order today was 2 char siu over vegetable, 2 char siu over noodles, 1 roasted soy sauce chicken over vegetable and 1 roasted pig over vegetable. I skipped the rice because I have no desire for it. All white rice does is take up belly space for no reason. I just want the good stuff. The roasted soy sauce chicken is so flavorful and the skin is that awesome gelatinous skin which sticks your lips and melts in your mouth. The roasted pig is awesome! The crispy skin puts it over the top and makes it super enjoyable. I must say that the char siu at Wah Fung is elite and is the way to go no matter how many times you visit. There are few things worth  going on long walks for, but the char siu at Wah Fung is well worth every step. I am now hooked on this stuff and am proud to admit it.

Chloe S.,/user_details?userid=XH4_ND1zwe6PIdMuF89MSA,"Seattle, WA",10/16/2015,5.0,I thought I just had to come to Wah Fung before I took the Fung Wah bus back to Boston. You know this place is gonna be good by the fact that the line is around the block. Trust me it's worth it. For $5 you get a GIANT styrofoam container full of rice and cabbage and then the entire surface is covered in amazing delicious BBQ meat. If you want a normal sized portion you can get a smaller container with mostly less rice for $3.75. Cash only here (obviously). They have a very limited menu in the best possible way. I got the pork and my friend got the chicken and both were incredible. Some of the best of this style of food I've had.

I no longer get the chicken or pork after trying the pig. It makes me feel gross as it's really oily, tasty as well as the exterior is crunchy fat that's heart-stopping great. In case you adore fat-encrusted greasy meat, get the pig. It's really nice and so poor at the exact same time.

For $3.75 you can get a small char siu fan (roast pork rice) and they also have soy sauce chicken and duck.

The next day (Sunday/today) I decided it was worth it from viewing all of the mouth watering photos. I live in Hells Kitchen and decided to trek all the way out here which took 30 minutes due to the D train rerouting onto the F line (boo). Waited in line for a good 20-25 minutes. Messenged my roommates if they wanted to try anything from this place (all 3 decided ""yes"") and put in their orders and venmo'ed me. I held up the line a bit with my order: 1 roast pork + rice, 1 roast pork + noodle, 1 roast duck + noodle, 1 whole roast duck chopped up & 1 roast pig + rice. Total? $34!!! I only had 20bills so I gave them the change. I'm assuming no one tips at this place because the old lady and man holding down the joint looked at me at first with confusion and then gratitude. The $6 tip they deserve for the speedy service & later, justified in the tasty meal. OMG. Do you like no frills, greasy Chinese food?! This place is it. I got back to my Hells Kitchen apartment an hour later because there was subway delays (con ed decided to power off in some stations)... anyway I decided to have a feast by myself in front of the tv + an already opened bottle of prosecco. The taste of the food was exactly what I had been craving!!! Each to-go box was filled to the brim and overpacked with rice and meat ! Let's just say I will be back.

While I'm all about mom and pop shops in today's age of gentrified neighborhoods and I am a Chinese native in this area for over 30 years, this business should not be operating and if you had access to the stairwell just next door of them to see their basement and yard, you would see the truth. If I still had access, I would have provided photos but anyone with access to the building would see this. They even kept a poor diseased cat who had infected eyes and a bad limp in this area of the basement, running really hot down there. One day they saw me trying to rescue it but it got away in another locked room down there, and the next day the cat was gone and never seen again for the next few months, when it used to be there every day with no escape to the outdoors.

His old offerings (usual food cart fare) was in the back. And the rice boxes were in the front. It was so cheap a few years ago and it was still delicious.

Get a large pork, chicken, or duck over rice for the best bang for your buck as it actually costs more for the same amount of meat if you order the meat alone. The small meat over rice is also a good deal but why not look under your couch for an extra buck twenty five to get double the food?

Wah Fast Food is a tiny store front with no seating but they do not mess around on the food. Their Cha Shao pork is to die for and the duck and the chicken are amazing too. The line is always the most torturous part as you can smell the sweet and savory aromas of the pork the entire time you are waiting. You order your food and they chop up the pork/duck/chicken fresh for you. I always make sure to order just some pork to take home and freeze for later. The menu is mostly in Chinese so bring your best Chinese friend if you want the most authentic experience.

We each got a small pork over vegetables (it's just cabbage) and rice. For two of those and a bottle of water only set us back $8. We took it to go and waited to eat it on the bus. At this point, it was cold but still very tasty. It was very filling so even with the small, I could only eat half to start. It was a little greasy, but food tends to show it's true amount of oil when it cools down. I'd definitely recommend it for it's value and quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wah-fung-no-1-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This place is a hit or miss really, and it may be hard to communicate if you don't really understand or speak Chinese (this coming from a Chinese girl herself who knows only a few phrases in Cantonese). Luckily there's a menu right behind the Chef. I ordered the large with all 3 types of meat, and I was rather disappointed, forewarned by previous yelp reviews that the duck had a lot of bones I still thought I should sample all 3 meats, and my favorite was definitely the pork (char siew) just because of the flavoring it had and the fact that it had no bones!!! Seriously I cannot emphasize this enough the bones in the duck varied from noticeable to these little pebbles that I did not even realize were bones until I bit down on it, and damn did my tooth hurt after. Overall this place is a small business but for its pricing which was 3.75 for a small (which I should have gotten) and $6 for a large with any meat, this lunch was definitely a steal. I'm definitely returning again for that char siew. But be warned cold charsiew from this place reeks of oil and pork, but once heated up again, its delicious LOL. Also  there's more to this place than just char siew, duck and chicken, although these are definitely the highlights.

The Roast pork seems to be more fattening than the roast pork I had at other places. You can look at the pictures that other people have posted on yelp to confirm my observation.  Also, I think there's too much sauce on the rice.

Within the hour this place filled up like mad! It definitely had more of a lounge vibe than some of the more traditional ramen spots. My vegan miso ramen was very flavorful, full of all the fixings and all in all delicious. We got the shitake appetizer from the bites, which came with big pieces of toasted bread. But the appetizer was basically hummus with 3 pieces of charred shitakes up top. It was a totally bizarre dish tbh. It ate Mediterranean in flavor, and was way too heavy on bread before consuming ramen. Happy I tried a new spot, but I'll be returning to the more traditional ramen spots around the neighborhood instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tonchin-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Zhang C.,/user_details?userid=lHFLFIc0DT1phaJlfFg3Yw,"Queens, NY",1/10/2023,4.0,"For a fast food style restaurant, you order and pay at the counter after you get seated. There were many selection of beers and wine listed on the wall. Fairly simple menu with limited selection of items. It was like going to a upscale Popeyes or KFC. We had almost all the items from the menu. 3 pieces of regular size fried chicken with 2 sides costed $27. A burger was decent priced around $10. I personally preferred the burger over the fried chicken. The fried chicken's flavors were super intensely and too oily. The original had the least oil and the spicy chicken was super oily, it was dipped in hot oil after the chicken was done frying. The egg covered fried chicken was not much of difference from the hot oil dipped chicken, the egg was always an oil sucking and form a super oily skin of the chicken. The chicken itself was super crispy which that was good. The sides were my favorite. I recommend getting the string bean, the bean and the rice. Those can help you simulate with the oiliness from the chicken. Overall I am not a fan of oiliness food and I am not expecting myself to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pecking-house-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jonathan T.,/user_details?userid=Rasj7fpxmimkHLix38Djeg,"Brooklyn, NY",12/4/2022,5.0,"Peking House started off as a waitlist a couple years ago. I was on that waitlist religiously. I also had the privilege of eating at the OG location in Queens. Eric has long been an awesome chef carving out a name for his incredible fried chicken and while the fried chicken is incredible, all the other dishes he offers is just as amazing Eric already knows that I live for his bone broth. Every time I go, I order quarts and quarts and quarts to go. This time I got to visit his new restaurant located closer to me than the last location. I wasn't sure what to expect. I was hoping that the place had not become gentrified or too hipster, which normally happens to good restaurants. Luckily, the food is just as incredible as it was back in Queens. I am lucky that I have access to some of the best fried chicken in the world spicy is the way to go however, if you have children, you can always order the spicy Szechuan oil on the side and pour it over your own piece This time I also tried the salty egg fried chicken, which was absolutely incredible. Not sure if my Asian heritage is the reason why I love it so much but it is definitely something worth trying. If you are feeling adventurous, the dirty rice is the same race they had in queens as are the fried brussels sprouts both simply amazing. Add the start of the show it's always the broad, bean side, savory, crunchy serve cold, and absolutely delicious. I am not usually a fan of beans like this, but these are delicious and I highly recommend you try them. The bone broth itself is the perfect cure for a cold, the flu, world, peace, and pretty much anything else wrong in your life, loaded with ginger and white pepper. It will shock you back into a state of absolute happiness also ordered the spicy chicken sandwich as well as the regular fried chicken sandwich with foie gras on top of it. The foie gras was absolutely incredible served fresh, and a really large portion for the up  charge. All in all this restaurant is incredible. I'm glad that they are back and will gladly give my business to them that as much as possible. Come try this place out. If you like fried chicken it is probably some of the best that you can get don't forget a couple years ago. There was a wait list of about 10,000 people for this chicken and if you try it you'll understand why.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pecking-house-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Richard W.,/user_details?userid=NPgFxhnx0kku4ZA8bFhDig,"Bloomington, IN",3/17/2023,3.0,"With all the good reviews and an interesting menu, I thought this was worth a try. My first attempt was the Ma Po Tofu sloppy Joe, just because it sounded so good. I was disappointed - without the Szechuan pepper or soft tofu, it really lacked flavor and texture. Hard tofu might make structural sense, but along with a slice of avocado, it really did not work.  So since the chicken is top of their list, I did not give up and tried the fried chicken, one with hot chili and the other with salted egg. The chicken was way over-cooked, over-salted and unsatisfying. Yes it had a nice crust and a good crunch, but the salted egg sauce was too skimpy to make any impact, and while the chili was spicy, it didn't have much else going for it with everything so over-cooked. The breast meat was still dry and stringy.  The bean salad on the side was the best thing, and the mac and cheese cornbread was mostly just cornbread.

In hindsight, it's a love it or don't (but not hate) kind of fusion experience. I personally didn't love any of it despite my trying to mitigate my own expectations. The chicken was juicy. The spicy crust was plenty oily and spicy. But the combo wasn't for me. The salted egg was interesting in that it was like a creamy crust. I guess what I love about fried chicken is the chicken skin and the batter ruined it for me. Not the fault of Peking House. I just really wanted Popeyes. Oh well. The sides were ok.

The pasta is fresh, flavorful, and delicious with a thoughtful combination of flavors and textures. My friend added the $6 burrata to hers and that was definitely the way to go.

Keeley G.,/user_details?userid=SVTH55FF5eXW4n_TBF39Ow,"New York, NY",1/6/2023,4.0,There are a few different La Pecora Bianca locations in Manhattan. I'd heard that this Bryant park location was a great option for a midtown work lunch so I decided to give it a try. The options are a bit expensive but such is midtown Manhattan pricing. I love that you can add burrata to any pasta of your choice! My dining companion had the same order of rigatoni with burrata and we both agreed it was an enjoyable dish. I absolutely loved the Brussel sprouts. It's a really large portion considering it's a side. We shared it between the 2 of us and did not finish.

A couple of my friends got the Garganelli so I was able to try that too, and I actually enjoyed it over the Rigatoni so next time I'm coming, I'd probably order that one! One friend also got the Toscano salad and added salmon to it, I thought it was also a great dish. Perfect if you want something lighter for your meal! We got 1 order of the Local Burrata as an appetizer and I loved the burrata paired with the sweet figs.

One dish Gramigna, curly pasta dish was outstanding.  It tasted just like we were in Italy.  They did not have a good selection of drinks or cocktails, otherwise it would have been a 5 star review.  Service was great & location was awesome.  if you're in Manhattan, near 41st & 5th avenue, I highly recommend La Pecora Bianca.  Don't forget Online reservation.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We didn't mind but it took her 10 minutes after catering to them to get our order. Our appetizer comes out I asked her if we can get more bread she said sure but was hesitant. By this time its been 20 minutes and we have not received our bread or seen her. Our entree comes out and not once did she even acknowledge us but asks the table next to us multiple time if their food was good or if they needed a refill or anything, but she never once came to our table after taking our order.

We were able to make a same day reservation which was great. We arrived early and were seated right away. Advice right off the bat - if it is cold outside (it was 37° when we went) DO NOT let them seat you anywhere near the door. Every time someone opened that door we were blasted with ice cold air. I had to put my coat and scarf back on while we were dining, which I would not usually do but it was just freezing with the door constantly opening. We got the meatball appetizer. I would consider the meatballs and sauce to be average. I ordered the tagliagelle pasta and it was fantastic. I ate every bite. My husband got the strip steak and said it was mediocre. Service left a lot to be desired. My husband was half way through his steak before they brought him a steak knife. He also had fries with his steak and was not offered anything like ketchup for them. He was also never offered a refill of the tiny glass of soda they brought him.  While I really enjoyed my entree I don't think we would return here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered a bunch of appetizers, love the meatballs, burrata (with figs), zucchini fries and roasted cauliflower. The quality was awesome,great combination of the ingredients and tasted fresh. For mains, me and one of my friends ordered pasta, really love the sauce and the texture of the pasta, flavorful and chewy. For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu for 4, it came with a cute sheep on the top, super creamy and smooth. The waiters and waitresses were welcoming and attentive. Overall, we were very happy about the dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was not aware that this place was fancy and was worried I was underdressed. I was here on a Friday afternoon and it was packed! The service was impeccable, they definitely know how to do hospitality. There was a table next to me (the table was a bit close to me, but everyone had to be vaxxed to eat at this location), and the table returned an appetizer due to a health concern and shortly after the manager came by to ask what was wrong and if they could do anything to turn around the experience. When I observed this, I was blown away because not a lot of restaurants do that! Even if it was just a health concern/allergy that the person wasn't even upset with, they still checked in on the customer. As for the food, the pasta I had was delicious and I had the olive oil cake which I have been hunting down for since I had a friend that shared an olive oil cake slice. The place is super clean, very elegant and the staff is super friendly.

I went in with a group of four friends - we had a reservation - and they seated us quickly, which was nice. Once we went to order, the waitress pointedly asked one of my friends, who had ordered a FULL MAIN as her meal, if that would be enough food and that she should get an appetizer (to be clear, none of the rest of us ordered appetizers or received this comment). My friend was flustered and agreed... and ended up being served at least 3x the amount of food of the rest of us, which she couldn't finish. When she asked for a box, our server literally rolled her eyes at her and begrudgingly obliged. The server spent the entire second half of the meal being incredibly rude to all of us in general, rolling her eyes a ton - and to the point where we were all commenting on it because we were so shocked at the behavior. The server also brought us still instead of tap water, which we hadn't asked for, and ended up charging us $27 for WATER ALONE. Finally, we wanted to order desert for the table. When my same friend went to order, the waitress again asked her if she thought that would be enough because the dish was very small while glaring rudely AGAIN!! - As if this poor girl hadn't just been forced into ordering an appetizer she didn't want, couldn't finish her main, and now just wanted a bite of a dessert that we were planning to share. The waitress was clearly trying to make a larger tip off of us by forcing us to order more, and we left shocked at the behavior. Will not be returning.

However, I have never had a positive experience with a server (across two locations). Most notably, this restaurant is very difficult and inflexible when it comes to dietary restrictions. I have a dairy allergy and have run into many challenges with getting a meal that meets my needs given the inflexibility of the servers and the menu. Further, the servers are often downright rude - I've gotten very negative reactions from servers when questioning about my allergy, and our sever last night completely forgot our appetizer and was disrespectful when we questioned about how long the food was taking. I definitely would not recommend this restaurant (at any location) and have no intention of returning again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Suzanne T.,/user_details?userid=tIw9FxrLUkDJu3xWruC6fA,"Saddle River, NJ",12/11/2022,1.0,"I Visited La Pecora in Bryant Park, today, December 11th, for a Christmas lunch with my daughters and their friends.  I was very disappointed with the service.  We waited over an hour for our food and they forgot our appetizers and delivered them after our entrees.  I would have been willing to accept slower service because it is Christmas in New York, but, when the waiter came back to fill our water he dropped my glasses of water and it shattered all over our food and table.  I was soaking wet and my daughter's friend sat on a piece of glass and ripped her tights. They cleaned up the food that was wet but never brought us new water.  As an apology for the spill and shattered glass they offered us two single scoops of gelato to share between 5 of us.  I decided to complain to the other manager and after he asked the server what happened, he came back to the table with the impression that we caused the spill.  In the end I explained that it was the server, not us that spilled the water and broke the glass and he ended up comping our dinner.  I understands that accidents happen and that places are busy at Christmas time, what was unacceptable was: 1. The server placed blame on us for the spill and broken glass 2. Our water was never replaced so we had no drinks and the glass was never cleaned up from around my seat and the water with glass in it was never removed.  Very disappointed in this experience!  Additionally, the female manager, Rea - (she would not give us her name loud enough for us to hear) did not assist in solving the problem, after the accident, the team scattered and left us to fend for ourselves, we sat at 2:45 and did not leave the restaurant until 4:50.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The vodka sauce rigatoni was excellent, and so was the chicken milanese (I personally especially liked the salad that came on the plate with the chicken).

A C.,/user_details?userid=yU_HLaC6X2wlV0biHAh5cA,"Irvine, CA",4/6/2022,1.0,"All I can say is that the food was mediocre at best. We were a table of 8, for a birthday dinner on a sunday night. We had a reservation so we were seated immediately but they stopped us on the way in because we had cake. I asked them if they could hold onto it for us while we were eating dinner and asked if we could celebrate with the cake after dinner. They said there was a cake cutting fee of $5 per person..... and even if ""cut"" it ourselves, there's a fee for even if we want to eat it in the restaurant. We ended up not having cake together because we had already ordered an overpriced meal per person and a bottle of wine. The food was okay but it definitely was NOT good enough to be priced that high. I got a brussel salad and their most popular rigatoni which there are plenty of pictures on here. The rigatoni was just normal and there wasn't anything special that made it stand out. The brussel salad was fine too, the sauce and taste overall was a bit strong and I didn't like that the raisins were pickled but that's just me. We had a pizza to share in the middle and it was not hot at all, it was a cooled down temperature with a super thin middle and thick crust. Not my preference but maybe others like their pizzas like that .... To each their own I guess. Overall, the servers weren't too attentive even though we had clearly been one of the larger tables and one of the only tables celebrating a birthday. In the past, I have been to so many more restaurants have made efforts to make a birthday dinner that much more special because we chose to have it at their restaurant. I just remember leaving the restaurant feeling unsatisfied and disappointed by everything-- especially the fact that they don't have bread as an appetizer!!! One of the best parts of an Italian restaurant is the yummy bread with olive oil and balsamic and LPB did not have it at all. Not even available to order as a side. So disappointing and mediocre.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pecora-bianca-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My daughter and I shared a bottle of their own label dry rose; it was a perfect accompaniment to our very different shared entrees.  The branzino with Swiss chard was a winner - lemony and salty/savory with the addition of capers. Our other choice was the tagliatelle - also delicious.  The only complaint is that the serving dishes should have been hot. The food cooled down too quickly. We also ordered a side of the roasted Brussel sprouts.  These were amazing! For dessert we shared the tiramisu for two - delicious but really can feed four or five people! (Not complaining - lol - enjoyed the leftovers the next day) Finally ended with an espresso martini - best one ever! This is a very convenient location close to GCT.

The location Inside of WholeFoods took a little time for use to find, but the hunt was worth it. We tried the nachos, tacos, enchilada and horchata. The horchata was the only thing I might not order again, it was just ok, and didn't have quite the right balance of flavor of horchata that I'm used to - maybe it wasn't sweet enough, but it also didn't seem to have enough cinnamon, and there was another flavor in it that didn't belong that I couldn't put my finger on. The nachos were the star, as was the vegan chorizo taco. The salsa verse was a tad too sour, but everything else was excellent. The service was prompt and friendly. The area had a unique decor from the rest of the Whole Foods market so it felt like it's own separate space.

Upmanu L.,/user_details?userid=mMYP4Z-koUZ0pBu2Vsi4zg,"Manhattan, NY",12/12/2021,1.0,"overcharged and no vaccination check. We went to this place based on the reviews and past experience at another location. It was not crowded and it is located inside a Whole Foods. We ordered 3 Tacos each for 2 people. You pay at the counter and then sit down. No one asked to see our vaccination status, even though there were signs posted that they would check. After the food came, we were discussing that it tasted good and was well priced given the location.  As per the Menu the Tacos were $8 for 2 and $3 for a third one = $11 for 3. I had paid $28.30+15% tip at the counter (=$32.54) and opted for no receipt on their checkout device. This did not seem to be right, since we should have paid $22 + tax (8.85%) = $23.95. So, I went and talked to the checkout person. She rang up 3 tacos and informed me that it was $13. I pointed out that this did not match the printed menu or  the menu on the board above the checkout. She was dismissive and said that the menu was wrong in that case since the prices in her device were correct. I pointed out that this was not a good situation and they should fix the menu prices to reflect what they were going to charge. Her reply was she will pass my comment on to the management. I have never run into a restaurant with such deceptive pricing policies. We and likely most customers rarely check the details of the bill so likely they can get away with this kind of practice.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/jajaja-mexicana-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ordered the chicken mushroom chili wonton and the beef noodle. The beef noodle was good, a solid 3/5 but the wonton is under cook and have this doughy taste. First i thought nothing of it since it's my first time having this place, by the 3rd piece i realize there's no way a thin wonton skin can be this chewy and doughy then that's when i break apart the wonton and inspect it. The dough was definitely under-cook which pretty much mean i had atleast 2.5 under-cook chicken meat wontons. I know i ordered the food kinda late but damn, atleast make sure the food is cook before you clock out.

Angela L.,/user_details?userid=qds0RgNCDa2D2t9E4rH2tA,"Midtown East, New York, NY",11/19/2021,4.0,"Popped by on a Friday night with a friend when everything was booked in town and glad I did! They had a seat for us immediately and there was relatively short wait to receive our food - maybe 10 minutes or so. We got the Pan Fried Pork Buns which had a nice crispy bottom and were slightly juicy on the inside. I thought the Spicy Pork Wontons were very much on the mild side but flavorful enough. Our favorite dish was the Sautéed String Beans as it came with a slightly sweet dark soy sauce mix and very tender. The only disappointment was the dan dan noodles as they lacked flavor. Overall, I loved what they did with the space for a casual and chill dinner - very modern, clean, and spacious especially for New York. The decor is a mix of neutral tones and some modern Chinese photography on the wall. The bathroom is clean, always a plus.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/3-times-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

A little disappointed to see that the LES restaurant didn't have a lot of the entrees on their social media page. I I ordered the crispy croaker rolls instead, its basically fish wrapped in fried bean curd skin. It has a very crispy shell, the fish inside is steamed tender, it almost melts in the tongue. The only thing I dislike is so much oil is used to fry the roll, there was so much oil I could see it dripping. They give a sauce to soak up the oil; which I find in dismay is something like thousand islands sauce, quite thick and tangy, which doesn't help lessen the oily taste of the fried bean curd skin at all. Me recommendation would be to serve it with a sour or spicy sauce in the future?...the Tangyuan were fine, nothing special, I don't think it was handmade, but just be bought from supermarkets instead, but still a decent meal",https://www.yelp.com/biz/3-times-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Their signature dish Shi-bing-tong is like Chinese version of savory crepe with different fillings inside but skin is more crispy. It was very good. Their dumplings were also very good. Filling and skin proportion was good unlike some other place that  has very thick skin with little filling.  Noodles were quite impressive also. It's different from the usual lo-mien. It's not oily, simple with noodle and topping but it was very good. Staffs were very friendly and they have plenty of seats.

Joseph T.,/user_details?userid=Cns9kEt9-9wmuvUg3jNz7A,"Brooklyn, NY",7/18/2022,1.0,"I have eaten here on two different occasions with the most recent being 7/17/2022. My girlfriend and I decided to revisit this place after we had come two years ago for my birthday since we didn't get to try the pasta. We sat in their garden area towards the back right of the restaurant. I will say, the pasta did not disappoint. However, the reason for my 1-star review was the rats that were running around behind us. I didn't get through all my pasta when I noticed them and from that moment I couldn't eat anymore. Some other guests there also noticed the rats and one of them even went up to the area where they were to try to get a better look. When I called our waiter over and discreetly mentioned the issue, he nonchalantly told us ""Well, this is Brooklyn. There is nothing I can do about it"". He then asked if we wanted to move inside instead of apologizing about it first. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there so we requested the check. For them to give us a response like that knowing that is a clear health violation that can get the business shut down is unacceptable. It doesn't matter what borough you are in. A visual sign of rats is a clear indication of what is happening inside the restaurant and if it has a chance to affect my food?

Christina G.,/user_details?userid=r2mNNrfcq97V-qaK1taI1A,"Franklin Square, NY",9/13/2020,2.0,"So we did not have a reservation but fortunately we were still able to get a table. My first impression of the place is that they have beautiful greenery but once I interacted with the host he was very snippy and I guess he had his friends at a table because I saw him go over there to sneak a sip to drink a few times. Anyway we were seated on the side walk which was still fine but it took the waitress awhile just to bring water to us and also to even bring the mixed drinks we ordered over. The drinks we had were nothing to rave about. We ordered the croquettes to start and they were delicious but the fried calamari we ordered was dry and oily. For dinner I ordered the ravioli and it was actually pretty decent, we also got skirt steak and it was good but the quantity of the dish was lacking. There was a few slices of steak on a plate but not much to eat. Overall I'm giving this place a 2 star because the hospitality was lacking, waitress was lacking, and food was just ok. At this price point the standards should be higher. A little disappointed but maybe next time my experience will be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The crab was seasoned and tasted so succulent the greens were so complimented on the dish that it was as perfectly paired as a pb+j sandwich. My boy Sebastian had the short rib burger, looking at the juices flow on that bad boy i said I'll risk it all, Covid? Bring it! I bit in to that bad boy and fell in to a delicious sea of tenderness and perfect seasoning, it was as awesome as encountering your first burger, Revolutionary. The salmon eggs Benedict were also so delicious, the smoked capers placed on top were so crunchy and the tomato complimented the salmon perfectly!

I was so excited to try this place because the decor was really cute but the food and service was terrible. Not once did our waiter come and ask if we were ok or if we needed anything else. We waited about 20-30 mins before we ordered because our waiter was not around. We got the calamari to share, it was alright nothing special. We all got pasta, I forgot the name of the dish but it was absolutely awful!!!! It was soooo salty we barely could eat it, of course our waiter did not bother to ask how the food was. We all left our plate of pasta full because it was just honestly not edible, I could make the dish better myself. I am so disappointed and will definitely not be returning.

Anup R.,/user_details?userid=ORUSfeLmO-l8M9kjmyqjng,"Chicago, IL",3/27/2017,5.0,Came here for Sunday brunch before going bowling. The outdoor enclosed garden area was great. Our party got seated quickly. Pomepelmo was a good take on a mojito. They give you bread while waiting for your entrees which was delicious. Soft inside and crunchy outside and were quick with refills. The entrees were tasty. I got the Parma eggs Benedict which the waiter said was the most popular dish and I can see why. Only thing is the side salad is useless. It's just a few greens with no dressing on the plate. Would rather have a couple more potatoes. Fiancé got the eggs florentine which was equally as good. Definitely recommend this place for a regular non boozy brunch in Williamsburg.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was still busy even at around close to 11 by the time we left but then again it's Saturday night in Brooklyn. The place is nice and they have a charming outdoor seating area. For appetizers we ordered the octopus which was great and fried zucchini blossoms stuffed with mozzarella cheese and anchovy which was amazing. Too bad it's only a special for the night because it was delicious. Sadly my squid ink pasta entree was terrible. It was so fishy tasting. It was overwhelmingly fishy. I forced myself to not breathe and eat a few bites because I didn't want to offend them if they saw that I didn't touch my food (I am way too polite at restaurants..Sometimes to my own detriment). I've had squid ink pasta so many times at so many different places so I have no idea why this one had such a fishy taste. Maybe it was the clams??

I had a home made saffron pasta with shrimp ragu. It had a distinct flavour of sea, in a good way, and the pasta was cooked al dente. A great pasta dish. My husband had spaghetti vongole- also good but it as memorable. The service was superb throughout. We got a wine recommended that was great with our food.

It's comfortable, natural lighting through large windows. The staff are down to earth, casually dressed, very comfortable vibe. There's optional outdoor seating in the summer...or a closed outdoor seating area in the winter. I think they make their own pasta in house. The flavors of their dishes are really well put together. For brunch I had a salmon dish. It came with avocado, cured salmon, goat cheese, poached egg on a whole wheat bread. Very good. Overall, they use simple but good ingredients to make outstanding dishes and I highly recommend. The prices are moderate. The bill was $95 for three dishes, one appetizer(heirloom squash it was sweet and salty), one drink(mimosa) and 2 lemonades. Lemonade was $4 each. Tasted fresh as if it was homemade. Overall, I would keep coming back to try everything on the menu (besides beef or pork).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The eggs Benedict with Parma and ricotta was rich and delicious, exactly what you want for brunch. The polenta with eggs, kale and mushrooms was perhaps my favorite. Say yes to the side order of bacon, which was sliced and cooked to perfection. More like a tasty crispy strip of pork belly. Such an excellent balance of flavors. I cleaned my plate.

We originally chose this spot because it has a really lovely outdoor garden area, but it ended up being booked out for a private party. The inside of Aurora is very simple with dark wood floors and tables, brick walls, and minimal decor. I got the paccheri pasta with eggplant and mozzarella- it was delicious and I love how all of their pastas are made in house daily. That is quite a rare thing at most Italian restaurants in New York. The only negative is that there weren't that many exciting options on the menu. It was the very usual eggs benedict, frittata, and burger options.

Nichole K.,/user_details?userid=aFHoc8JGImkeHC65pOrxew,"Brooklyn, NY",6/1/2017,5.0,"I struggled if I wanted to give four stars or five, but ultimately, the bottom line is the food was really good. The service was great. The ambience (we sat outside) was beautiful & so welcoming. The prosciutto was so tender & not slimy which prosciutto can sometimes be. The olive oil they put on the table, on a silky note, was one of my favorite parts. They make their own pasta. I love places that do this. You can tell it to. It really is so much better than dried pasta. The two things I didn't like were the amount they gave you. We had a table of about 15. I looked down the table at the end & everyone's plate was licked clean. Yes, that means they like it, but it also means there were some people probably still hungry. For the price, I believe the portion sizes could be a little bigger. The second thing is the Williamsburg 'your lucky to be eating here' that some of the younger generations foster. Let me explain. They don't want to give you bread with olive oil because it makes the tables too messy and the menus get ruined. The menus are printed on a thick resume type paper. Really. Just print more. We were starving b/c our party got there at 7 & didn't order until 8:30. I don't know whose fault it was. It could have easily been someone at our big table causing the lag, so I can't point fingers. But if one end of the table is telling you they are starving, please oblige. It's a restaurant. This goes back to, 'no, we can't give you a side of fresh fruit even though we serve it as a side on another dish.' Mentality, that makes me mad. One reason people go out to eat is because of choices. Enough of my rant. I would eat here again. Although not if I was really hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sam M.,/user_details?userid=DvkkNm6I3iNYVAKzEl2WgQ,"New York, NY",4/14/2018,5.0,"With an hour to spare before a movie at Nitehawk, my date and I were looking for a close spot to grab dinner. We walked by Aurora which was pretty empty (it was around 6pm on a Friday) and decided to go in. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and has a lovely outdoor seating area which I highly recommend if you can get it, we were not able to sit outside due to reservations and by 6:30 the entire restaurant was packed so in the future I would make a reservation. Our server was wonderful, very nice and quick which was perfect since we had less than an hour for dinner. I ordered a cocktail called the Darlington, essentially a very upscale vodka tonic which was good but very small for the price. I then chose the Arctic Char, it was on the specials so I don't know how often they have it, but if they do when you go it is a MUST. Perfectly cooked fish, smoothy creamy polenta and amazing charred artichoke hearts. Pure heaven. Date got the fazzoletti with lamb ragù which he said was delicious.

It's cute and rustic but like a typical hipster DB place, they wouldn't seat the entire party without everyone being present. It was Easter Sunday morning at 11AM and quiet. I told my party to go ahead and just start ordering and eating. They did. It was filling up by the time I got there but I ordered and the rest of the party ordered coffee/tea. I got a green fave bean salad which I finished rather quickly. It looked promising and fresh, but I'm not sure what ingredients they used. I started coughing a bit (I'm allergic to preservatives) so I'm convinced something in there - maybe their dressing - was NOT fresh. Waitstaff was pleasant but they wanted us out.

I personally really liked the Gnocchi and Beef Wrap, but didn't find the Tonton Hot Pot to be very special. If I ever come again, I'd focus more on the small plates/appetizers. It's pretty pricey, but I'd say average for any place here in Midtown. The Gnocchi had a really strong mentaiko and sweet taste. And what I loved about the Yakiniku Wrap was that the wrap (similar to Chinese scallion pancakes) wasn't soggy as all. The Tonton Hot Pot is a good level of spice, but felt the portion was really small for the price. And, there wasn't anything impressive in the hot pot itself.

The almond pudding was better at Kimura.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/hakata-tonton-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We didn't have reservations so just opted to sit at the bar, which worked out since we weren't getting hotpot. Service was fast and efficient. We just wanted a quick bite, so opted to try a few of the app plates. We ended up ordering the citrus salmon, pepper chicken, roast beef rolls, and garlic pork belly. Everything arrived fairly quickly, portion sizes were good for sharing with 2 people max. I loved the brightness of the salmon citrus, that was my fave dish, especially with the roe! Second fave was the pork belly, you can't go wrong with either flavor. They have a nice assortment of specialty cocktails, along with beer and liquor, which we did not indulge in tonight but good to know for options. We enjoyed our dinner here and would come back to sample more plates!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/hakata-tonton-new-york-7?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We shared the pepper wings, the small Tonton hot pot (spicy miso broth, chicken thigh, pork feet, pork belly, dumplings, tofu, vegetables), and the green tea tofu dessert. The wings were crispy and the black sesame gave it a good crunch. The small hot pot was a good portion for two people. The broth was flavorful and had a good kick to it. My only gripe was that there were only two small dumplings and I wanted more haha. The green tea tofu dessert was the best dish. The tofu was so silky and definitely tasted homemade.

It still wasn't enough food for me personally (I think l was just extra hungry that day) but I liked everything on the menu! I especially liked the shake shake ramen which they have in a big mason jar and they literally shake it in front of you to get all the yummy flavors mixed in nicely with the noodles and the sauce. It's a cold noodle with chicken I think.

Taheefa S.,/user_details?userid=xUl9ugLVt-4jnRrSNJmEpw,"Brooklyn, NY",1/7/2023,5.0,"I love going to SoCo. Every time I return it's like nostalgic, of real home cooked food very comforting but with class and sophistication for the presentation. It's warming and welcoming coming here. Being greet when you came in was like coming to an old relatives house who you haven't seen in years. We were seated by the very hospitable hostess and then greeted by our waitress sooner after. Their menu you short and sweet with a wide variety for every palate. We ordered apps; deviled eggs and smoked wings. I went with the BQE salmon burger which comes with a baked potato for my order and my partner with the chicken and waffles for his entree. Sealed the deal with a m&c for the table. The apps were gone as soon as they hit the table none other than delectable. The deviled eggs have a new touch with a crispy chicken skin on top and overloaded with mixed yolk filling. My BQE Salmon Burger was delicious! The taste of it was warm and buttery you can tell it was made to order and fresh. Soft and just right for the bun. The seasoning was all there if you wanted you could've ate the patty alone! However, it was made for the sandwich. Together on that bun, lettuce, tomatoes and that Zesty sauce it was phenomenal! I would definitely go for this option on the menu! The baked potato was lined with cheese and given sour cream on the side to light it up! This entree now is my favorite on the menu!

Anyway the music was a vibe every single person we encountered was professorial and nice. We ordered wings for appetizers and Mac and cheese. The bday boy loved the wings (I'm not a wings person) I absolutely LOVED the Mac and cheese probably one of the best I've ever had. My and hubby had a pitcher of Sangria ( no fruit lol ) it was thick not watery but i still didn't get a buzz. That's okay it was a school night lol i ordered the burger OMG!!! But it doesn't come with fries ( i had two small daughters they were disappointed there weren't fries) but the baked potato it came with was okay. I was so full from the Mac and cheese i took a doggy bag for burger ate it the next day for lunch while at work . Let me tell you that chipotle mayo is the . My hubby ordered the pasta he liked it, the bday boy ordered the baby back ribs enjoyed it. My cousin ordered the pecan crust chops she raved about it . Basically all the food was phenomenal we'll definitely come back( without kids) lol  we even embarrassed my son and sang him happy bday .. Two things i feel would've been better more lightings .

This time, I had the fish and grits. It was superb. Very flavorful and creamy. I feel as though the fish could've been meatier, but the price point is good, so no complaints here. Also, for me, if deviled eggs are on the menu in any restaurant I'm getting them and it was no different here. The deviled egg was classic, with a slight fried chicken crisp. No big innovation to the classic, but great tasting. The only thing that prevented me from giving 5 stars was the wait for the food.

I called 6 times & emailed twice over the course of 4 days to try to make a reservation for a large group. Every time I called, I was told that it would be taken care of & they would get back to me. Ultimately, the day before I needed my reservation, they said they would send me a prix fixe menu to look at and decide on options & that once I got that back to them via email, they would send me a form to fill out for a deposit...the very same people who never responded to my initial emails & never addressed my issue when I called multiple times wanted me to plan on a reservation that hinged on me emailing them back twice before my reservation the next day.

Loved sitting  in the back with the glass roof. The food was phenomenal I had the chicken sandwich and the strawberry short cake and Oreo cheesecake deserts. Everything was perfectly seasoned the sandwich was a perfect combination of salty and spicy,  the chicken was perfectly crispy. My friends had the chicken and  waffles and it was delicious as well. The deserts were also perfectly balanced not overly sweet. We also had the chicken wing as appetizer and the were some of the best wings I ever had.

I am now pescatarian and had stopped dining there because I felt like the menu contained more meat options. I was pleased to revisit and see they had updated their menu. The weather was nice so we asked to be seated outside, unfortunately because their plants are real, there were ants. Brunch used to be bottomless but now they offer just pitchers that was a tad bit disappointing. My friend and I started with the cornbread which was scrumptious! For our meals my friend ordered the steak and eggs, I ordered fish and chips, and we had the Mac and cheese to share. The food was good no complaints. Service was fine too. Overall experience was pleasant however the restaurant will need to do something about the ants for the outdoor seating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Teleah R.,/user_details?userid=Ye1B-iqQ8KHUy-iQQI4GcA,"Jamaica, NY",5/8/2021,1.0,"We sat down at 3:30pm. The waitress didn't take our order until 35 minutes later. And it was not crowded on this day we seen her standing around. So once she finally came I ordered the fried chicken and waffle dish. By the way this event took place on 4/17/21 around 4:00pm. Our main food came out about 40 minutes later. The appetizers took about 30 minutes. On the first order I took a tiny piece of the chicken and it tasted weird. Something told me to break into the chicken before actually taking a real bite. I'm noticing the chicken is pink very pink. I start tearing the chicken closer to the bone and it was wet with pink blood. So I called the manager over he said oh you want your chicken well done ? I said excuse me I want it cooked, this is not steak where you request medium well, the chicken needs to be fully cooked before serving. I could be eating salmonella. And I let him know I'm actually pregnant. This is ridiculous. So he said okay we'll get you another order well done. This is the 2nd order you see in the picture to me still looking pretty pink I didn't eat it. I didn't want to take the chance. The waffle tasted like water flour and red die. It had absolutely no flavor.  The waitress never came to check on us. The manager never came to check on us after the 2nd order to see if the chicken came out better. The only thing on the table that was decent was the macaroni and that was decent I was starving I still had to end up getting something else to eat before I went home. The bill came to 118$. My friend ordered salmon cake appetizer and a shrimp lobster dish, she said her salmon was okay  she didn't enjoy her main dish. My friend paid 60$ cash I paid the difference. Omg while I'm typing this review I'm checking my statement and they charged me the full amount for the food $117.29 I'm definitely about to call my bank right now. They were suppose to charge me $71.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The space is a bit small inside but not uncommon for Brooklyn. They also have patio space in the back. I started with the Mardi Gras drink, which their version of a rum punch. It was very good and I definitely felt the rum! My friend ordered the smoked chicken wings and said they were unexpectedly delicious with the tzatziki sauce. I got the fried chicken and red velvet waffle. I'm pretty sure the chicken sits in a brine overnight bc it was some of the best I'd ever had! The waffle was good as well. Barely needed any syrup.

Joann L.,/user_details?userid=JQ9ZwC2ESFFp1E78iBPW-w,"Brooklyn, NY",12/31/2020,4.0,We did a group take out from this place and they did delivery the food extremely quickly. Their menu is pretty extensive and everything definitely sounded good to me. The only downside to ordering from online was that there was not any drinks option at least on Seamless. I ordered the Soul Fried Chicken Sandwich which came with a side of fries. The chicken was super crispy and tasty. It was amazingly flavored and it was pretty decently size as well. The fries were also amazingly seasoned as well which I was pleasantly surprised with. The only downside was that we placed a fairly large order (maybe 9 different items) and it only came with two ketchups even though 6 of the orders were the Fried Chicken Sandwich with fries. They also did not provide any utensils or napkins even though there were some orders that definitely required an utensil but other than that this place was super tasty and I can definitely see myself coming back in the future!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jennifer F.,/user_details?userid=yXFfemF5OvbBh687ZTaNLw,"Long Beach, NY",2/9/2020,5.0,Came here for brunch this past weekend and sat in their outside area which is heated. Everybody wins! Got rum punch by the pitcher. Ordered mac and cheese with the fried Catfish and cajun fries. Mac and cheese came in a skillet with a cheesy crust but still creamy once you dug in. Delish! Catfish was a bit on the salty side so I had to use the lemon wedge that came with it to so that helped. Other than that I'd definitely swing by here again. Waitstaff is friendly and they let us sit and talk for hours without telling us to buzz off so A+ for that.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I recommend reservations for a large party with an option for the pri fixe menu at $50 pp. The staff was attentive and there were no complaints on flavor or portion size. Still an awesome fixture in Brooklyn. The music gave me life, a blend of Afro carribean vibe but was slightly too loud at times.

Reservation was made in advance which I would highly recommend on a Saturday night. Hostess at the door is cayuteeee, friendly, eye catching! We were seated right away in the area in the outer part of the restaurant. There was a large party also celebrating there and they were soooooooooooooooooooooooo loud. Aside from that, love the section we were in because it's like the cut. Crystal was our server. Order was taken within reasonable time. Drinks...simple....how do you mess it up. Virgin pina colada came out looking like pineapple juice. 3 men came over to check it out and then brought out what looks like a pina colada....on the rocks...that's different....no cherry, no pineapple. Lol...my mom requested a cherry at least and the manager brought out like 5. That was comical. What turned her completely off was when she said ""what happened that y'all don't know how to make a pina colada?"" He basically said you should come work for me....whew Chile was she offended lmao. I had a sweet tea, no issues. We ordered Cajun pasta, fried catfish, and marinated steak...all of our plates were cleaned. Food was good! Strawberry shortcake was a no for me, my aunt seemed to enjoy it. It's a busy night in Brooklyn, my expectations for amazing service wasn't high to begin with. My mom was annoyed, I was chill, my aunt enjoyed it all! It's was a decent night. I've been here a few times before with other people.

The drinks were average wouldn't recommend. The main course I had the lobster, shrimp, and grits delicious. I would recommend. My friend had the pork chop with the mash sweet potatoes and collard greens. The pork chop was good but the pork chop needed seasoning. I think they only season the flour when making it.

Madalena G.,/user_details?userid=EJ_gdZtiUaNTQa9WzqgeVg,"Brooklyn, NY",11/3/2019,2.0,"I came here last night for the first time and I was not too impressed with my experience. I'm giving Soco 2 stars because the food was delicious, however the service was not so good. First I made a 8:30pm reservation for a party of 5. Upon arrival we were seated at a crammed table that was clearly for 4 not 5 people. We were elbow to elbow and the table set up was 2 of their small tables put together. When we looked to the right side there was a table available for a party of 6. We complained to our waiter and the general manager came over to speak to us. I forgot what his name was but he was very rude and unapologetic about the situation. He stated that he didn't have other options available and that we could wait upfront for 45 mins. I told him that didn't make sense since we had a reservation which we were on time for. He responded with he has a lot of reservations. The table of 6 was then separated into a table for 4 and a table for 2. I could not believe how ridiculous they were about the seating arrangement. We couldn't even comfortably eat because we were crammed. Also parties of 5 and above they automatically add the gratuity into the bill so read your bill carefully. I might try them again for brunch but I was not impressed with their service whatsoever.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Erica A.,/user_details?userid=Gzp6eDnZWHF8QZHlLz_FmQ,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",9/30/2021,1.0,"I loved Soco, the food is amazing but here's the thing, rules and regulations now apply. Only vaxx groups can dine in, while unvaxxed groups must order takeouts. Clearly, I had no choice but to order take out and I was very disappointed. Firstly, the food portion was way smaller compared to the amount of food you will get in the restaurant. Secondly, the food didn't have that excellent quality I would normally receive when dining in. The star of the restaurant for me is the Mac Cruz & Cheese not sure about everyone one else but I love my mac nice and brown on top oozing cheese. Negative, literally did not get that when I went back home at all which was 35 mins back. The mac &cheese was in a small plastic container which I felt should have been in an aluminum pan instead, that will be suitable to go into the oven and lay flat. The Mac&cheese that was in a bowl, looks like it was picked up by an ice cream scoop straight from the refrigerator and place into the microwave. Then the cheese wasn't melting, even after putting it into the air fryer for a few minutes to warm up. I ordered cornbread as well, it was already hard when I got home, and warming it up was pointless still hard, I would like to curse, but I'm too cute for that. Don't get me wrong the shrimps, lobster, and grits and mash potatoes were good warming it back up but the cornbread and mac and cruzzy were not good at all to even do takeouts. The moral of the story is it's best to just dine in overall with the food, you will get it freshly hot and serve or eat as soon as possible outside or better yet in your car.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I am very pleased! It was a very modern and young atmosphere. Very nice on the inside and patio seating. Nice bar area. Staff was nice and accommodating. Went during Saturday brunch. While there were quite a few people there, there wasn't more than a 5 min wait for seating. The food was AMAZING!!! I had the buttermilk fried chicken with a red velvet waffle and the Mac and Cheese!!! Good portions and great flavors! Very cute for a girls day/night out or a date with your sweetie.

However today... NOT THE BUSINESS! For the most part, the majority loves ribs.. right?! So this time I chose to order outside the norm that I usually get. I ask the our server (who was very kind) about the ribs. She stated they are delicious. However I seen on there it mentioned ""spicy"".. so I asked her about how spicy are they. She simply said they are spicy. Which is fine.. to a degree. But because I love ribs, I chose to order them. WRONG ANSWER. They were entirely too spicy to consume. The bridge of my nose was sweating my nose was running just after a bite of one. So I asked them is there another bbq sauce they can add to tone down how spicy there are.. they offered me a glass of milk. Lol! Like come on. The food was barley edible. I couldn't really send them back because I ate the mashed potatoes and the coleslaw.. which was the only thing I enjoyed. Even my drink which was the red lemonade was filled with cherries of some sort but literally no vodka. I was then told this is how they are made based on what the ""owner"" wants.. it's his ""vision"" Okay?! But it my money they paying for it right? Like I didn't understand. I even heard a woman adjacent to my table have a similar concern. I felt absolutely taken advantage of and I'm absolutely disappointed. I love going out to eat and supporting restaurants in my neighborhood.. however they were so dismissive about it, I will never return. So basically I paid $28 for mashed potatoes and cold slaw and $14 for red lemonade with a lick of vodka. How disrespectful. Wow. You'll never get my business again after that.

However, I wish the sugar was toned down a little bit. Our waiter, Malcom I believe, have an upbeat attitude with great aptitude on describing the menu and helping us decide. We ordered a Jambalaya. They were able to create a deep flavor in the jambalaya (sautéed Pepper and Garlic). AS the true authentic southern jambalaya, you can see in the picture the sausage, rice and shrimp simmered with tomato sauce. This dish was spot on.

I had the shrimp and grits and my friend had the red velvet chicken and waffles. We shared an order of Mac and cheese which was off the chain! Waitress was nice. Drinks are strong. Tables are a bit too packed in there though, it's like you're sharing a meal with the ppl to your left and right as well and they'll hear everything you talk about.

Nadia M.,/user_details?userid=hgHWYt3HwGOxtd3b63T78Q,"Brooklyn, NY",7/9/2018,2.0,"I'm up in the air with rating this place. I started off with 5*'s and had to remove a star from every encounter that made it go from great to good. So, when I arrived I met my friends at the bar. They already had a drink and the hostess told us our table was ready and we headed to our seats. At first, they placed us outside in the corner. I asked the hostess if we could sit inside with the music so we can feel the atmosphere where the music was playing. After 10 minutes we were seated inside. That worked out well. Our waiter approached us and seemed to be so frazzled. I would have thought he had 20 tables.  He took our drink and food orders and I showed him my free cornbread when I do a Yelp check-in. 10...20 minutes in 1 out of 3 people receive a drink. The other drinks are still being being made. I asked about the cornbread and he said its coming. 20 more minutes, my drink arrives and it's wrong. In fact I have no idea of the contents. 20 more minutes, the food and the rest of the drinks arrive. We ordered 2 shrimp and lobster with grits and 1 sausage with grits and a side of scrambled eggs. I again ask about the cornbread and I'm told its coming. Ok. How's the food? Honestly, I enjoyed it. 5 minutes later the cornbread arrives with butter. I would have thought that it was coming fresh from the oven considering the wait time but it was cold. They always say to watch what you ask for. So I'm 3/4 the way finish with my meal when my friend shows me a curly strand of hair in the butter. I wanted to barf up everything . My friend calls the manager, standing behind us, over to show him and to request another butter. As we sat and waited the manager decided to advise our server to address the issue with us. Such a bad move by a manager. The server proceed to show us a cup with sprouts in it and tells us we saw sprouts and not a hair. Good thing I took a picture. I was born with hair, I'm sure I know what it looks like. We explain to the server that it was hair and request the manager to return to the table. We than explain to him that was poor judgement on his part especially when all my friend asked for was more butter not a discount or a free meal/drink. All he said was ok, ok, ok. They must be hiring managers off of street corners because that was the worst response I've heard from a manager. My friend then ask him if he could bring her a new cornbread since he removed her plate with the cornbread. He obliged. All said and done the food was good except for the mishap and i would give it 4 stars. The service was horrible and the managers response with the service added insult to injury. Thus, the 2* rating. I really wanted to love this place. Hopefully, they will be humble in the future when it comes to customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It felt like it was more like a club than a restaurant. We were seated right away and it took a while for a waiter to come up to us and take our orders. I showed them that I checked in so that we can try the cornbread. It was freaking delicious. I hate corn bread and this one was perfect. I could eat these all day at this restaurant. But I was a bit upset to find out after we left that they didn't give us the cornbread for free, they had charged us. But no big deal. Anyways, I ordered the jambalaya and I forgot what my friend ordered. But the jambalaya was pretty good, it was a bit spicy but that's how it's supposed to be. We also ordered the Mac and cheese which was pretty good. I don't normally like Mac and cheese either so for me to say it was good, means it's good. We also ordered drinks, I had some kind of drink with vodka and vanilla and caramel which was amazingggggg. My friend had something similar to a jalepeno margarita. And we both enjoyed our drinks very much. The price was a bit much but it was worth it.

I literally told a couple of people today that this is my favorite restaurant and I will personally have to retract that statement. Lately I've been noticing it going downhill, but today took the cake. To make a very long story short, multiple items on the menu they do not serve, will not make any substitutions, the cornbread was cold and hard, and I was offered an array of sides to accommodate the fact that they no longer serve what they are still serving on the menu. Any items listed as chicken sausage dishes are now pork, so please ask!! The kitchen even decided, seemingly on their own, that they would not serve salmon during brunch, even though it is on the brunch menu. I was thoroughly confused and disappointed, left hungry, and waited for food that never came for an hour. Even after it seemed like I would be taken care of for the inconvenience, I still ended up with a $25 bill for a small Caesar salad and a drink. Soco will not be seeing me or anyone I speak to for a long time until they can sort out their organizational and managerial issues.

Cordelia N.,/user_details?userid=8XnROzl-lKdXvO_dcdZzew,"Brooklyn, NY",11/2/2020,5.0,"I never rushed so fast to make a review for a restaurant. My best friend and I came during a busy Sunday afternoon in the mood for some brunch. We had no reservation and were still seated almost immediately. No lie guys, as soon as our butts touched the chair, someone plopped hand sanitizer and our utensils right in front of us - talk about perfect timing. For drinks we ordered two glasses of mimosas, a pitcher of their Soco sangria and two other drinks I can't seem to remember the name of but our server suggested it to us. The mimosas were very bubbly and different, the sangria was amazing (sneaks up on you so be careful) and the other two drinks were made with love and with the intention to get us tipsy (which it definitely did). Now on to food: My friend ordered the strawberry shortcake French toast with eggs, bacon and Mac and cheese (once again suggested by our wonderful server). I ordered the chicken with waffles and a side of the Mac and cheese. Let me tell yallll , the food was so on point flavor wise, everything was perfect. I wish I remembered our servers name, he was amazingggg and really made sure we had a great time. I'm a server myself so I know great service and he was a blast. We left a generous tip and he came back around to thank us and to our surprise - free shots on the house. We left Soco amazed with our belly full ready to bust, drunk and with leftovers. We went home and slept for 7 hours straight and even when we woke up we were STILL FULL. Thank you so much for an amazing time, can't wait to come visit you guys again. Can't wait to tell all my friends about this spot!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered a number of entrée dishes and everything was great although my hashbrowns and toast or room temperature my eggs however was warm and hot. My friend had the strawberry shortcake French toast which to be honest is so good to look at and tasted just as great it was sweet it was savory it was fresh. We also have a hibiscus agave margarita and Asoka sangria which were all great the hibiscus margarita took us to that point really quick so we ended up ordering two more rounds.all in all everything was great service could've been a little bit more faster but it's a Sunday in Brooklyn and everyone is going to brunch so I could understand why service was a little bit slow.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was not disappointed everything came out piping hot and the Mac was the very best ever!!!!

Ohhhhhh I forgot to mention the drinks were definitely on stage as well, I enjoyed a Bellini for the first time and I would definitely order another one if or when I go back.

Alex M.,/user_details?userid=F9IMKXB9zO9SdI_hUVMnNw,"NoHo, Manhattan, NY",4/8/2021,2.0,"This past weekend we decided to go to Soco for Easter  brunch. They do a temperature check, make everyone complete the Covid questionnaire and wear a mask until you are seated. Everything was fine until they decided to sit people very close to us; not social distanced AT ALL! The tables were not even 3ft apart which was very concerning to me. When I spoke to the waitress about it she made it seem as if she was going to talk to the manager about it and didn't. Instead she never came back to our table for rest of the time we were there and sent another waiter to take care of us. We had already ordered our entree and appetizers which made it difficult to get and leave. We tried moving our tables and were told it was not possible. Needless to say We will not be going back as it was very uncomfortable for us to enjoy our food and time and on top of that being ignored and treated as if we were asking for too much when asked to be distanced from other patrons.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The restaurant is a blend of southern dishes with an east coast twist to many of the dishes. These red velvet waffles and fried chicken taste like they were made by your aunt who makes the thanksgiving Mac N Cheese. No bottomless mimosas here but the food is worth the visit, they also offer great carafes that do the trick.  The vibe is super chill but don't let that fool you.

Jacqueline N.,/user_details?userid=07YgUh6yKCTuy_Ff2_cJ2A,"Brooklyn, NY",11/22/2020,1.0,"Soooo. Went to Soco once before and really enjoyed the food. Came back last night and now I realized why they have bad reviews. Food was mediocre. I honestly felt as if people didn't want to help/serve us because we were Asian. Stuck us in the corner of their store and it took us 10-15 minutes of sitting around to get a glass of water and no directions as to how to get a menu (seems there may have been a QR code? We ended up pulling up a menu up on their website as a last resort). I literally raised my hands up for minutes with no one caring and I can tell there were workers standing by the walls who saw me and pretended they didn't. When water and dinnerware were finally brought out, they were missing a set and of course that took a while to get anyone's attention to remedy too. Mind you, it wasn't even that crowded. Food came out at an unbearably slow pace and wasn't anything spectacular. This place absolutely deserves a 1 star. I won't be returning nor will I be recommending anyone else to do so. There's much better food with happier service elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Angel S.,/user_details?userid=okmfkKuGXxq18nvmK6u16g,"Linden, NJ",1/13/2020,4.0,The location was perfect. A quick walk to the subway on a really nice block. I notices a parking garage across the street. So we made a reservation and due to the subway system we were 9 mins late. The gentleman who greeted up who I believe was the owner said the gave out table away out ready but if we wanted to seat right away they had space in the front. If we wanted to sit anywhere else it would be a 35 or more minute wait. I was disappointed as I really didn't wanna seat by the door and wanted to see the back part of the location but I was also hungry so we took the seat up front. They do a mimosas by carafe rather than bottomless. 40 was a little to expensive for just the two so us so be passed on drinks. I decided on the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with the red velvet waffles and Mac a cheese. I wanted all dark meat but the four dollar up charge talked me out of it. I was glad I didnt. Normally white meat is too dry for me but this chicken was amazing! Perfectly seasoned and so juicy. And the waffle was just right. The Mac and Cheese was to die for! The people next to use shared their mimosa with us so that was a win. Brooklyn isn't a place to a travel to often but I would def check this place out again and make sure to be on time get better seating. January In nyc and sitting by the door can ruin a dining experience. There service was okay for the most part. The waitress did seems to have a lot of tables .,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Evan C.,/user_details?userid=RhP4oyRMvxgYhSGHyJy_1w,"Shirley, NY",8/6/2017,4.0,"So, very interesting story, I was hungry. I mean what else is new? Oh and we were also celebrating so that's a real reason to go out. My friends and I were treating so we needed to find the right place. One of them suggested ""SoCo."" After looking it up I definitely wanted to give it a shot. Parking is crazy around the area, so plan early. Looking at the building, I loved the dark look. I couldn't believe how well it fit in this up and coming part of Brooklyn. Going inside I noticed the place is longer then it is wide. But it wasn't that bad. A+ for the live music playing, it definitely added to the vibe. The place was packed, I was impressed with how many people they got inside. The locals definitely know all the hot spots in Brooklyn. The tall boys we sat on were comfortable enough, I just personally prefer a booth. The staff was nice and so was our waiter. The orders got placed and we waited for our food. When the food came out we all got quite, you know that means it's time to eat. The odd thing is that if you ask each person at the table they will tell you something different about there experience with the food. Two people got the same thing, the chicken and waffles, one liked it the other didn't. I got the mac & cheese and felt it was to dry. I liked the corn bread and mashed potatoes, but my girlfriend didn't like the mashed potatoes. I thought that was strange. None of us agree one hundred percent what was good. The only thing we all liked was the corn bread. I do like the place myself and will return, I will just bring ""Yes"" people with me next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I wish that I would have taken more pictures of my food. However to start off, I ordered the deviled eggs and cornbread. When I say I don't even like deviled eggs, but I was intrigued by the description on the menu so I gave it a shot. Boy am I glad that I did. The eggs have a crunchy pork topping which enhances the flavor times 10. Now let's talk about the cornbread! Baby!!! It was fingerlicking good. It was so sweet and savory. Definitely a must have. I had the fried chicken with the red velvet waffle and that alone was mouthwatering. I hate that I didn't take a picture. I will definitely return!

The food was good and my waiters, Mike and Lucas where nice but my perception of the restaurant was tainted by the poor service I received from the hostess upon arrival. The restaurant was going to open at 12 p.m. and my friend and I arrived about 11:55 a.m. The hostess would not let us sit inside at least at the bar, she made us stand outside for 5 minutes until they opened. I thought that was poor judgement, from that point on the experience wasn't as good as it could have been. On a positive note, the mac and cheese was very excellent and so was the chicken and waffles. I would not recommend the cheddar grits as they lacked flavor to me. The hibiscus cocktail was very pleasant, so I would recommend that one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sade T.,/user_details?userid=y4EtU6kwo7gvj54bwrxujg,"New York, NY",4/26/2018,5.0,I attended yesterday for lunch and it was a great. The Chicken wings are by far the best selection on the menu and I've tried a few selections . The reason for such a great rating is due to the service I had from your amazing waiter  Lukas. He was so polite and fun.. very vibrate. He was very knowledgeable  of the menu and the cocktails they offer. He suggested everything for me. He is a true gem to your restaurant I will only attend for him lol.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Dania F.,/user_details?userid=c85iSHVWiZoTE8HIH_QF4A,"Queens Village, NY",2/2/2020,4.0,I would've given SoCo 5 stars if not for the wait time. I visited this locale for my birthday. It had been a while so I was excited. The bar staff (while I waited) was amazing. I had a lemon drop for the first time and I wasn't disappointed. The food and drinks pretty much made up for it all. The chicken and red velvet waffle is amazing and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't try the Mac and cheese as it's too delicious. I would definitely go back for brunch with the girls or for a casual date experience.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

If I was in the privacy of my own home, then fine.  But this is an establishment with different age groups and races.  If I was there with my parens I would have complained about the music.  Again the food, drink and customer service 5 star but choice of music made me drop my rating to 3 stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The mac n cheese is served on a small skillet but enough for 2-3 ppl. It is AMAZING. I swear I want to go back for this mac & cheese.

Brandon W.,/user_details?userid=_LTJwPYLX-0R_QdR2DwGfA,"Elkridge, MD",11/11/2018,5.0,This is one of the best black owned restaurants I have had the pleasure of visiting in a long time. The service is very accommodating and the ambiance reminds me of an upscale club but with the sociability of a gala. The kitchen is fantastic and I highly recommend the brunch menu. The sweet potato pancakes were a sweet treat paired with the whipped cream and the dragonfly shrimp were very crispy and are paired well with the chipotle mayo. I highly recommend the County Sangria for a nice and steady buzz throughout the meal (if you're into that). This place is honestly a great place to feel the presence of a welcome and flourishing black community along with a hype playlist as you eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered the side of okra and tomato, veggie flatbread and salmon with mashed sweet potato. It took 1.15 hours to get our food and 15 minutes to get our menus. The salmon dish was so flippin small that my partner is still hungry and the flatbread was basically bread with HUGE raw onions and tomatoes on top. Gross!!! The waitress was rude and careless. The hostess was extremely rude, she had no manners what so ever. I guess she assumed she was the manager . She took my name and number and said I'll text you. 20 minutes later she passed me and said ""What's your name? I texted you?"" And she kept walking. Uh rude! But I guess it fits the crowd .

It has both indoor and outdoor seating which is great for when you want a change of ambiance. The servers are always so friendly and respectful and some even go out of their way to serve you by asking about food allergies and refilling your drink (not just the water lol!) One downfall is that on occasion the music can be so loud and overpowering that everyone tends to shout to be heard and then the restaurant is just a loud mess. Some days they have live music (a full band or a violinist) and that's always great. Oh last but not least, their Mac n cheese is THE BOMB! I've never had anything like it.

We came to this place out of recommendation of a friend who lives here. We are visiting for Afropunk from California. We came here after calling all morning and no one ever picked up. Then we try to make a reservation online and nothings available. So we take our chances and go into the restaurant. The apparent manager Sam says he can seat us for a 4 o'clock reservation, it is currently 3:20. We say no problem and go next door for drinks. We return for our 4 o'clock reservation and  the hostess immediately says she can't seat us because the guys are wearing tank tops. Mind you we came in dressed just like this 40 minutes prior and made the reservation and none of this was mentioned. We start complaining to the hostess and telling her that we made the reservation in person and nothing was said to us. And she says don't yell at me I've been on my lunch. We ask to speak to the manager and he says he was trying to make an exception because of the Afropunk festival but he just spoke to the owner and is unable to make an exception and turns us away. This whole time he had our phone number for the reservation and never called us or anything. He didn't apologize but just said he wish he could make an exception but could not. We waited 40 minutes to be turned away by this fake ass restaurant with these dumb rules. Whoever heard of a dress code for brunch? Don't eat here don't give them your money when they have no problem turning away business. We should have been told from the beginning when he saw the way we were dressed.

The food was ok, nothing to brag about. Pooch hall, an actor from the tv show The Game, showed up and all hell broke loose! He stood right in back of my chair and took pics all night.

Y G.,/user_details?userid=oZBvFR_yTMyuni_OgsOyVA,"Queens, NY",4/6/2019,4.0,"We went here for a friend's birthday brunch. We were a group of 8 and some people were late so we lost the table. Space opened up at the bar so we were able to sit and wait while waiting for a new table.  The only thing I didn't like was that the hostess seemed to forget despite telling us that our table would be ready soon so that we continued to wait even after the table was ready. Someone from our party had to go ask.  This was around 3pm so the brunch rush was pretty much over.  The bar was pretty slow too because we ordered two pitchers of mimosas to start but they came literally seconds before we got our food. Everything was really delicious though and I have no complaints about that.  I had the sweet potato pancakes, which were huge. They were a little bit too sweet with the berry compote and cream on top but still yummy.  The mac and cheese was the star. It was creamy and soooo cheesy.  I'd happily get that again. My friends got the chicken and waffles,  which I'd try next time.  I would come back but with a small group and definitely stick to your reservation time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

A few people at the table weren't a fan of the shrimp and grits but as always I kept it simple with chicken and waffles. The ending was coming and we were at the bar getting drinks when the manager Sean approached us with such a bad attitude. He comes up to us in the back and tells us we can't have open drinks !

Tanya J.,/user_details?userid=gv0eLU4T2hsSfxkY-xq_MA,"Tampa Bay, FL",4/22/2019,4.0,"Absolutely love Soco. The host accommodated my group after arriving late for our reservation.  Food was amazing. My waiter was great until we were leaving, hence the 4 star rating. He approached someone in my party on the way out the restaurant asking about his tip. I understand the eatery was packed for Easter Sunday but he clearly wasn't paying attention. We paid our bill with 18% tip included. Stayed for an additional 1/2 hr after bill was paid. I'm assuming he had our party mixed up with another party. In any event it was a little embarrassing having a waiter chase us down for a tip that was already taken care of. I'll be back because of great food and past experiences. However, I will stay clear of the waiter who served us to avoid another embarrassing moment.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The service was terrible. We waited for over an hour and 30 minutes for a seat. We got seated by the door after all that time and had to flag a waitress down, because no one came to take our orders. That woman we flagged down happened to be the manager, but the quality of service never changed. We got the sweet potato pancakes as an appetizer, it was brought to us with no syrup or water to enjoy. Following that, our drinks took 25 minutes to come out, and our entree took another 25 minutes as well. Over all I am very disappointed with our experience here.

We were hungry so we waited 40 mins for someone to leave the bar. When we sat the bartender was so amazing his name was Daniel. He was just very nice and accommodating to us even though it was super busy. I ordered the F-Que wings with the baked Mac n Cheese and it was worth the wait!! I advise splitting the Mac n Cheese because the portion is huge. My cousin ordered the chicken and red velvet waffles but her chicken was dry (so upsetting ). Oh and if you check in on Yelp you get free cornbread so definitely do that ! All in all if it wasn't for the bartender being so cool and cute the experience wouldn't have been overrated.

Lydia A.,/user_details?userid=g-r6NMt10NntVjIh-fGVFQ,"Bethesda, MD",3/5/2018,4.0,"This place... So I kind of have a love and hate relationship with this establishment. A couple of friends and I decided on a weekend trip to NY from DC. We heard good things so decided to give SoCo a try. We made reservations on a Friday night and it was packed and busy with a nice booming Brooklyn atmosphere. There were a few celebrities in the house if you're into that sort of thing. The music was great the ambience was nice and the gentleman who walked us to our table was awesome. But unfortunately the service stopped there. After being handed the menu we waited about 20 minutes before we accosted one of the waitresses to come and take our orders. She was friendly enough and told us that it wasn't her table but she'd take our order. Everything on the menu looked so good and we took a glance at everyone's plate and everything looked amazing. I finally decided on the herb marinated skirt steak and it was divine. We also had an order of the cornbread and the lobster shrimp and grits, Yum Yum! The food came out in decent time. We never got an actual server, btw. The cocktails were also tasty. However, the bus boy hovered over our table and made us feel a little rushed after we finished our meals. Even though it was 11 pm and the restaurant was still relatively full. With that said, the food was absolutely delicious and he ambiance was awesome. I would return simply for the food.

Charles D.,/user_details?userid=386X7625rVwMbaJgFTQD-Q,"New York, NY",1/3/2018,4.0,"Had a reservation for 6 PM & arrived shortly thereafter.  I walked in and wasn't greeted by anyone. I did walk past the sign that said ""Please Wait to be Seated"". I then went to the bar with my company & decided to enjoy the happy hour menu and specials. I ordered the Mac & Cheese and the Wings as an appetizer & I must say the Mac & Cheese is the best I've ever had, literally. Once settled though, a runner (short, with a gold chain) was talking all sorts of nonsense. He was complaining and speaking restaurant  business in front of guests. He needs to know how to play the game and learn a quiet voice. I then ordered the Mardi Gras & Sangria drinks & they did the job. The female bartender was excellent.

As for the drinks, the sweet tea with mango is really really good. Hits the spot! Lastly, the unlimited mimosa for $15 per person is such a great deal.

Jessica H.,/user_details?userid=mzuback4oVNuhRGVh7LigQ,"New York, NY",8/18/2019,2.0,"I'll start first by saying I wasn't going to write a review because I'm a local customer to this establishment and have supported this black owned restaurant since they opened and the food there is delicious. The reason for the 2 stars (used to be 5 stars) The service here seems to be gradually getting worse and worse. Either you can't get through to the restaurant with the telephone listed on their site or in my case, you have an issue with an online order and have the experience that I had this past Friday 8/16. Firstly, The General Manager they have there is a clown. His name is Sean and he's the definition of why you can't give certain people authoritative positions In Hospitality. Without going into full detail, I ordered food online that never made it to the kitchen, even though the online app said it was ready for pick up. Instead of making things happen to avoid any additional frustration for me ( the customer) this ""General Manager"" is giving me a song and dance about his password not working to log into the website, and a bunch of other irrelevant stuff that I really didn't need to know. Never an apology for the issue or even a glass of water as I sat there visibly frustrated. As I sit there trying to shift my attention while I wait for my food, with a vehicle double parked outside thinking I was just picking up food and leaving, I assumed that this guy had already placed my order. I turned back around and he's standing next to me asking me multiple times if he should place my order? After taking a deep breath and calmly explaining to him that I rushed there from across town to pick up food for a elderly family member that requested it and that I placed the order over an hour prior to picking it up, I was exhausted and needed to know if an order was going to be placed or not. He boldly looks at me and says in verbatim ""oh, well thats not how we do things here, you don't just come into a restaurant and expect food to be ready"" I was disappointed and embarrassed for him. I was disgusted actually. I just got up and left. I've never seen a general manager act like that. There's another manager there that I usually see and he's always very pleasant and easy to talk to when there's an issue. Soco didn't need my hard earned money that day and they need to get rid of that ""General Manager"" Sean altogether.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was surprised they take reservations and we were seated right away. The restaurant isn't very big, so between the music, and the large groups, it was very loud. Drinks are wayyyyyy over priced. The website also offers two drinks made with Hennessy, but Hennessy is actually $2 extra. They were still good, though. App was good. We had the mussels and the shrimp rolls. The real problem was waiting almost an hour for our entrees to be served. We all had the salmon, so how long could that really take? And the best part was the food was cold!!!!! Why wait that long for cold food?? Lastly, they charged us automatic gratuity for a party of 5.

This place had a nice crowd so if you do want to eat here, a reservation is highly recommended. Since we got there 30 minutes before our reservation time, they were really cordial and got us a table 15 minutes early. For drinks, I stuck with Apple Cider draft beer and my wife started with Honey Jack and cola then Rum and Cola. Kudos to the bar for the cold beer and well balanced drinks. We decided to do one appetizer and had the California Shrimp roll, delicious. Only wish they would put six rolls instead of five lol. Our entrees, I had the Buttermilk Batter Fried Chicken with red velvet waffle and garlic sautéd string beans and my wife had the chef special which was a surf and turf with nice rib eye, lobster tail, mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. Of course, we shared each others dishes like any modest couple lol. I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts but these were delicious with a nice bok choy style flavor. String beans, waffle, rib eye, mash, all the food was good. Lobster tail was slightly over cooked but was still good. Fried chicken was OK but I have reservations about it. Dessert, cheesecake and smore, both delicious and best part, not overly sweet but perfect taste.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. My friends and I had a 2pm brunch reservation and we didn't get seated until 4PM!! I could maybe understand the wait time had we just walked in, however we had to wait for two hours. They also did not offer us any discounts or apologies for the 2 hour wait time which is unheard of. We even had to go somewhere else because there was no real waiting area and the music was so loud. When we were seated our waiter was inattentive and it took us an additional 30+ minutes to even get our orders in. And on top of that, in my opinion, the food was too expensive for the quality. I would not recommend SoCo to anyone unless you want a 3+ hour wait and mediocre food and service. P.S.

Being from the South, I was under the impression New Yorkers didn't know much about soul food. Boy was I wrong! I went with my friend to this jazzy restaurant on a Friday night. We forgot to make reservations. Luckily, the wait was only 15 minutes. We got seated and our waiter Rob immediately greeted us. I ordered the County Sangria. We started off with the Mac and Cheese. The huge portions didn't have us leaving the restaurant hungry. The mac and cheese was absolutely delicious. I ordered the Cajun pasta and it was the best pasta I ever tasted. My friend ordered the classic Chicken and Waffles. Depending on the appetizer, you may want to go straight to ordering an entree.

However when we were seated, we noticed an Asian gentleman sitting next to us with a baseball hat on. So my bf decided to put his hat back on. 15 mins later as we are eating appetizers and having drinks the same man storms over to us, passing the Asian man, indicating that he had to remove his hat immediately. When asked why the rule wasn't being applied across the board the employee had no words. We asked for a manger and the check to pay for what we ate and left.

The Mac and cheese was the best I've had in a long time and the corn bread was delicious. I was supposed to receive the cornbread for free with a yelp check-in, was still charged for it, but they gave us a 10% discount of the bill for the hair.

Monica D.,/user_details?userid=QBft3HbPymWjWvy4jb_-oA,"San Francisco, CA",2/8/2020,2.0,The food was phenomenal. Just a warning.. make a reservation first. I am from Queens on Friday night business in Brooklyn. A client told me to try SOCO. So we went without a reservation. They placed us in an enclosed outside area in the back of the restaurant. The seats were cold and the air was freezing. When we asked to go back inside the restaurant we were told those were for reservations only by the hostess. We asked the waitress who confirmed what the hostess told us. They also said the heater took time to heat up the outside area and it will get warm in a few.. it didn't. My back ached and I could not shake the coldness from my body. Eating dinner in your coat is not for me. And yes there were seats available inside,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friend ordered a modified Surf and Turf, I got the Cajun Creole Pasta and we got an order of the F-Que wings and the Aunt Cruz Mac and Cheese to share. I loved the the creole pasta. It was delicious, everything from the noodles to the shrimp were cooked perfectly. My friend loved the the 'Surf' in her meal. She got the lobster and it was good but she did mention that the steak in her 'turf' was really really chewy. The wings were AMAZING. Perfect sauce, not too sweet but we both didn't like the mac and cheese. Our waitress was amazing she took it back and didn't charge us for it. We ended our night with the strawberry shortcake and it was soooooo good.

Camren H.,/user_details?userid=32z0NWRsyn8Kzfw65dQerw,"Auburndale, Queens, NY",1/5/2020,1.0,"So, this wasn't my first time visiting but it was the third time. And they say, third times a charm. So, I had a reservation for 9pm for my friends birthday dinner. I arrived at 9 pm sharp and let the hostess know I was waiting for 5 other friends and that they'd be joining me in 10 minutes. With no hesitation, she assured me that was no problem. They arrived exactly at 910 and then she told me to wait 5 minutes so they could set our table up. Fast forward, it is 930 and the owner or whoever and hostess seem to be avoiding us. Then, it's finally 10pm and I just can't seem to understand what was the point of my reservation if I still had to wait an hour and some change to be sat. The owner or whoever then comes up to all of us and states that he never knew we had a reservation. Long story short, there was a bunch of miscommunication and honestly it felt like we were being profiled which is sad since this is a black owned business. Finally, we get seated and we had to wait 30 minutes for water. The food was subpar and by that point we were all just tired. They offered us a pitcher of sangria but honestly that doesn't make up for the hour and change wait on my friends birthday.

We were seated right away which was good. They seated us at one of the tables which I was disappointed at because I wanted a booth but it was reserved for larger parties but we dealt with it. The food service was so fast! We didn't have to wait a long time for our meal to arrive. We ordered the goat cheese pizza which was awesome but a little too much goat cheese for me. I had the jambalaya which is a must if you are trying new things like I did and my boyfriend had the skirt steak which he loved.

Doreen F.,/user_details?userid=vFaO9ljt2sKZkD9Hzv_Liw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",12/6/2019,3.0,Earlier today me and my friends decided to do brunch off my recommendation of this restaurant. It was their first time and my probably 10+ time. This place has always had great food and good service but today wasn't one of those days. On a normal visit I would of given this place 5+ stars but today oh no hunny! For starters our waiter came over we asked a questions so she went to the kitchen to clarify something came back with the answer an disappeared for twenty mins. No drink order nothing. A man I'm going to assume was the on duty manager came over and took our drink order. While I watched the waiter run to about three different tables and collect their checks.The waiter finally comes back and takes our food order. This is when real hell began imagine watching people who came in after you get their food enjoy and pay. We sat for an entire hour and half waiting for our food. We enjoyed mimosas on the house but it still doesn't make up for the service. About three tables came in after us and got their food before us. The food was great the service was terrible very disappointed in my experience today.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The only reason why we visited this spot is because it is Kenya Moore's husbands establishment (if you are familiar with Bravo's television show ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"". The decor of the place was very nice, modern with a touch of a rustic vibe. We sat at the bar and got a pitcher of the white sangria, it had plenty of fruits but was on the weaker side. I had the chicken and waffles but instead of waffles i had mash potatoes and greens. Not a huge fan of the greens but the chicken was cooked PERFECTLY and perfectly crispy and the mash potatoes were really yummy. My boyfriend has the sausage and grits and practically licked the bowl, so definitely would suggest these two dishes. Only con was that the menus were pretty beat up and the seating near the bar is very awkwardly set up.

I was seated under an A/C vent and it was ridiculously cold. I normally wouldn't complain, but it was becoming unbearable. I asked to move, but they couldn't accommodate due to the size of our party. I was also told that they couldn't turn the unit down because it gets too hot for the cooks in the kitchen (at least they're employee-focused). I would have just canceled my order and left, but I had out-of-town guest that with me and I was excited about introducing them to this restaurant. So I stayed and tried to tuff it out. The final straw was when I got ready to leave. The owner/manager who was greeting people at the door, didn't even bother to tell me to have a nice day or open the door when I exited. Normally, this wouldn't have been a problem, but he did it for the next 6-7 groups that exited after me. I got the feeling he was upset because I complained about the A/C vent blowing directly on me and he could visible see I was miserable during my entire meal (didn't finish it and steeped out-side several times to warm up). I spent way too much money in this place to be uncomfortable and not appreciated for my patronage. I really try to support certain businesses, but the customer service aspect has got to be a point of focus. As a matter of fact, I've just upset myself while typing this.

I ordered the chicken and waffles that were really good. I also ordered a side of the $9 mac and cheese based on the rave reviews from yelp and was greatly disappointed. The mac and cheese was truly a let down and waste of money.  The ambience of the restaurant is cool and the staff were friendly.

The food looked promising as described on the menu but didn't live up to standard expectations (EX the greens are greasy and sweet). Though there was ample staff that were knowledgeable and polite, the service was very poor due to not having enough people working in the kitchen or behind the bar. After being seated at 2:30, we didn't receive our food until 4:00 or our drinks until 3:15! I really wanted to love this place but that kind of time frame is unacceptable. I'm not sure how long a business operating like this can stay in the game.

How ever this time was a whole different ball game. I was there for a family friends birthday dinner. There were about 12 of us and they didn't know how to host a big party at all. Our waiter was rude and inattentive. To make matters worse, we brought in a cake {because it's her birthday duh} and was told that there is a $20 charge to keep it in the freezer. Seriously??!?! The owner was rude and refused to waive the $20 fee after we spent as a whole over $900 . I found that completely ridiculous and will not recommend soco to anyone again. They forced us to choose from a prix fix menu as well and the entrees were terrible .

Ellen H.,/user_details?userid=KfdDxrZ3cwmJMQXYJn8sCA,"Boston, MA",3/19/2017,3.0,"Just had brunch here today with 9 other friends. We did not have reservations, but were there right when they first opened (12pm) so we're seated right away. Our waitress Sacha started off with a really bad attitude toward me and my friends, when we were very polite and respectful. The food came out in about 30 mins which wasn't too bad of a wait, considering after the 30 minutes we waited for our food, almost every table/seat was filled up. Some of the things we got were very bland and needed salt and seasoning. (Collard greens,French fries, and homefries ...) the jambalaya and salmon was personally my favorite things on the menu. The chicken and waffles looked better than it tasted. 20% gratuity is automatically added to the bill of 5 or more people. I absolutely will and usually do tip over 20% to the waiter/waitress if they provide a good service. Our waitress ignored us the entire time being there... probably because she knew she was already guaranteed 20% tip.. anyways, was ran out of drinks and water twice and she completely walked by us multiple times without even asking if we needed refills... we ended up asking the bus girl in the restaurant to let our waitress know we would like more drinks, and when the waitress came back she was very rude the way she put down our drinks and the way she talked to us... we are a very easy going group and just wanted to enjoy our brunch here :( Over all we were all expecting a better experience than we had today.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nisa L.,/user_details?userid=XubDUu9tj9OHx1FyedR6kg,"Brooklyn, NY",4/21/2019,5.0,"I like their spin on soul/creole cooking. I recommend making a reservation, to ensure you are seated timely. I love their gumbo and rice and beans, I always order on the side or as an appetizer. They offer a few more sandwiches on the lunch menu that aren't available for dinner. So that's cool. The shrimp Po boy is the only one I'll eat from up here. Not all soggy and gross like other places. Lobster and grits are good, my son always orders it nice flavor not too overwhelming. I order the steak a lot, I like skirt steak, it's best grilled and they grill it just right. I haven't had the chicken in a while. When I last had it I wasn't able to pick white or dark meat, for the price I think that should be an option. I'm a tough sell with fried chicken so it could just be me. That also bugged my hubby. The waffle was freshly prepared and a nice size. The wings are good. Proportions are appropriate, I never leave hungry, I usually have a doggy bag lol. I love the Brooklyn Bellini, Hennessy and champagne with a twist. The drinks are good, not too flowery and egg based, but not boring. I think they have a happy hour, I have to check it out sometimes.

Definitely worth a try. The chicken and waffles were good. The red velvet waffle is sweet enough no syrup needed. It actually tastes like cake batter. The chick was crispy yet moist. They didn't ask what kind of meat we wanted but we asked for white meat and they accommodated us. The atmosphere is nice I liked to sit outside but not really being outside since the weather is not right just yet. The second time we went ordering the same thing we were disappointed. The chicken was sweet almost like a coconut skin taste. The waffle tasted more plain not sweet as before. We were thinking maybe a different cook. Their sandwiches look good maybe I'll try that next.

As part of my meal, I ordered the F-que wings and the grits. Much to my surprise, when one of the servers (a black woman who is bald-headed and was wearing large hoops) came out with the wings and grits, her nail (she had long, red-painted acrylic nails) was touching my grits. Immediately I told her I do not want the grits because her nail was touching it. She denied it and proceeded to show me how her hand was supposedly situated on the plate. I told her check her nail, she showed it to me and said there's nothing on there. I told her replace the grits, I'm not eating it. As I waited, I watched her in the kitchen-I was seated facing the kitchen. She called my server and had her serve me the same plate of grits. In order to not make a scene, I scooped up the part where the imprint of her nail had remained, and proceeded with the rest of the evening. I spoke to the manager before I left since I think it was only fair to inform him before I wrote an online review. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that this server did not mean to have her nail on my food. However, the point at which you will tell me I didn't see what immediately caught my eye as you were approaching me, her thumb's nail was in my plate and on my grits, then resend the same plate using another server is absolutely unacceptable and totally disgusting. There was nothing wrong in her saying, I'm sorry, it was certainly not my intent to touch your food, I will go ahead and replace it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Joy A.,/user_details?userid=PX9t-uF2T_GEDCdavjQ6XA,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",12/7/2018,1.0,"I have dined here about 4 times for dinner and I enjoyed the food and ambiance every time. However, I celebrated my birthday this past Saturday at their Brunch and the service from the manager, Annabelle was horrible. First, at the time of reservation we were not advised the kitchen closes at 3:30 and does not open until 6pm for dinner. Our reservations was for 3pm and we felt rushed with our food. A friend ordered the sweet potato pancakes which she did not like and tried to order something else and was told she couldn't because they were preparing for dinner. If we were advised of this pwe would have picked another place because we like to eat and drink without limits. While speaking with the manager I explained we were not advised of their policy regarding the kitchen but we would like to enjoy more food and drinks. She said we would need to move from our table because the table was booked for another party but we can sit near the bar because there was no waiters available to bring drinks and wait until after 6 for more  food... However, we had an under age person with us that was not allowed at the bar. I explained this and asked what else could we do because we are still celebrating, she advised I can do whatever I like but we couldn't sit at the table anymore because she had another party with reservations for the space. Then sat us in a tiny area in front of the bathroom. By this time it's after 6 and there still was no party at the table she moved us from and we ordered over $300 in drinks and $500 for food. Another worker felt our frustrations and sat us somewhere else. I'm not sure where this lady got here experience from or if she was having a bad day but I really felt because we were young, urban people she treated us this way. Now, I will not patronize this place of business again. This is not the place for a good time while brunchin'... try Ricardo's in Harlem instead!!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I made a reservation for 2 on Saturday at 6:00 pm. We checked in with the friendly host & were  seated promptly. We had cornbread (free after checking in on Yelp) & the Mac & Cheese as our appetizers. They did not disappoint. The cornbread was just right & the Mac & Cheese was the bomb! I ordered the molasses braised short ribs with collard greens & garlic mashed potatoes. It was soooo good!!! My friend had the lobster, shrimp & grits (another amazing entree). For dessert, we had the s'mores, yummy! Overall, I will give SoCo a 5 star rating. I will soon be returning to try their signature dish: Chicken & waffles.

I believe theres a top coat of brown sugar on the cornbread, it's not something I'm used to but was yummy none the less and free lol . I had the Mardi Gras drink , the nutmeg was strong but still very good. My boyfriend had a blue Long Island and he loved it. He ordered the steak frites with fries and fried onion skins and he said it was aammazziinng! He was saying how amazing the meal was a day later lol (he's ate good steak at steakhouses too so that's says a lot). I had the jambalaya, OMG! It was peerrffeccttiiooonnn!! Huge shrimp too! Very filling too. One of the customers did spill my drink on me and my server gave me a drink on the house which was very nice of her ! In the end she came out and sang hbd to my boyfriend with their strawberry shortcake dessert and he loved it . In conclusion this spot was perfect from the food , to the drinks , to the service!

Still, I hope this reaches the right person. With no reservation, myself and four friends were able to get seated quickly. The food and drinks were great, but the service left a bit to be desired. I felt the staff almost nudging us out the door. First, our server never offered us another round of drinks, despite our empty glasses. The staff was focused on clearing our table and boxing our leftovers the moment that we relaxed our forks. Then, when their hints weren't enough, our server flat out asked us to leave so that they could seat a party with a reservation. So, we took our coins up the street and bought two more rounds at Five Spot. Still, Soco left me with a sour feeling. I don't live in NYC, so I could chalk this up to differences in dining culture, but nah. We weren't there that long. And even if we were, we were paying customers who were willing to continue running up the tab.

Finally for my mother's birthday I decided there was no better reason. I had a group of 6 so I got to try a few dishes. I decided to order what they are known for and get the chicken and waffles, I am glad I made this decision. The waffle was so good and not overly sweet and the chicken was crispy and well seasoned. My sisters skirt steak was tender and the pork chop was very good as well. I loved the free cornbread that came by checking in on yelp. They also have fun and tasty cocktails.

Tanisha G.,/user_details?userid=p8FZk0-7gNEjXatJa-jAgg,"Brooklyn, NY",2/19/2017,4.0,I came with my BFF to celebrate her birthday.  We made 10p reservations and I was presently surprised to find that we were seated before 10p.  Our waitress was nice.  She checked in on us a few times and was very pleasant. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles and my friend ordered the short ribs.  The waffle was tasty but I'd rather it be a little more crunchy on the outside but it was still very tasty.  The chicken was so-so.  Ive had better. We also ordered the chicken wings for the appetizer which was very good. It came with a sauce that tasted cucumbery (lol..just made that up) and it complimented the wings very nicely.  My only problem was that the damn tables were so close together. When we originally sat down we had enough space to sit but then they put another table in between us and the party next to us.  There was no way that anybody could fit through without pulling the whole table out. I was just glad that we left before they could actually seat anyone at that table.  Overall we had a nice time. They are a little pricey but it is worth it for special occassions!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

After today's experience I will not be going back again. The place has gone down hill customer service wise. I don't even want to explain what happened today but it ended up a shouting match with managers and servers, we paid over our check amount and was to that we shortened them $211. The server had no idea how to calculate the tab correctly. It took about 1 hour for her to figure out the bill. It was quite a mess. The food has also lost it's zest. The red velvet waffles and fried chicken used to be so good. I don't know what has happened but the chicken portions have gotten smaller and the waffle is horrible. Soco's has truly lost it's touch. People will still go because it's a ""hot spot"" or they know no better. Everyone will have a different experience but after going to eat there for years and now will longer go back, that is saying something. Our entire party of 8 was disappointed and will not be going back. Some of them it was their first time going to Soco's.  First impressions didn't go well. Bye Soco's it's been real.

Stephen M.,/user_details?userid=HK86uOn7-M8w61WNZy8DnQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",6/23/2019,1.0,"This past Friday was one of my many times dining at the restaurant. All my previous visits were stellar, prompt service, positive attitudes from staff and quality food. However this past Friday I hosted a group of 15 women for my sisters 35th birthday with high expectation of what I planned to be an enjoyable evening I was severely disappointed. Our waitress was extremely inattentive with minimal knowledge of the menu. The waitress didn't immediately take drink orders, we sat for a long period of time before we were addressed. After ordering our entrees our food arrived at our table approximately 90 minutes later. The waitress did not come to the table to offer consolation or and update, instead she held a nonchalant posture. The manager was immediately alerted and offered excuses for the poor service. At the end of the night the expectation in every establishment in the civilized world would be for the manager to compensate the party for the subpar service, but not this manager he never once offered any discount or even offered complementary dessert for the honored guest. This was not only a disappointment but it was an embarrassment for myself as the host. I've elected to inform my friends, family and professional colleagues and even those I may not care for to refrain from patronizing this establishment, I've never paid a $900+ bill and was totally unsatisfied in every senses of the word.

I came here mid afternoon after work & got right to it. I ordered the (typical lol) chicken & red velvet waffles & a side of white cheddar grits when the food came. I had the sweet tea which was incredible & the bartender hooked me up with a little more of it for free! The food comes out....the presentation was amazing as I expected. The waffle was great & also my first red velvet dish ever & the chicken was hot, crispy & seasoned by Jesus Christ himself! It's kinda out of the way for me to just jump up & go to, but I'll definitely be back. Damn that chicken!!! Realistically you're looking at $20+ a plate, but definitely worth every cent!

Well after watching Atlanta housewives I was very much interested in eating here. So I when I got the chance I hopped on it. First being greeted by the door man who was very pleasant and asked me to remove my cap, which I thought was a bit much because I thought that only pertained to men but ok I entertained it and followed and was then granted entry and was then met by well let's say a person that could have used a tick tac and then was told that there was no seating. But the host was kind enough to swat us at the bar and it was happy hour so it was a win win I guess. Being seated at the bar we were met by a young African American sister who was very busy and was definitely I believe trying to handle the load of drink  orders they bombarded her. So I ordered my happy hour drink and my partner order a drink as well and we put in our order which was deviled eggs shrimp  lobster and grits and the blackened salmon and the Mac and cheese the salmon came with a citrus mashed sweet potato, which I'm not a fan of so i asked if I could have the red beans and rice and I was told that that could not happen.  So the waitress called over the host and he says no we can not change it but I can give u the garlic mashed potatoes instead I said cool . Food arrived and I was disappointed the Mac and cheese was terrible dryyyyyy like a desert  but the rest of the food  welll it was meh‍ I don't recommend u traveling from far to venture here.

I ordered 2 orders of chicken and waffles (one for me, one for the Boo) and an order of mac & cheese. We brought the food home, I placed the food into the oven for a few minutes and my kitchen all of a sudden had a strong garlic smell. The mac & cheese was OVERLOADED with garlic, beyond belief! We rarely ever throw food in the garbage and guess where that mac & cheese went? The photos I've seen of the mac & cheese are deceiving. There was not one ounce of cheddar, it was all white cheese. The chicken and waffles were nothing to write home about. Chicken lacked seasoning, had NO flavor at all and the syrup was heavily diluted, we just grabbed some good old Aunt Jemima from the kitchen. I should have saved my $54 and made my own damn mac & cheese for 1/6 the price. Will not be going back.

Very professional and courteous. I don't recall my servers name but she was great as well.  My son wasn't fond of the fact that our table was next to a door way that opens out onto the enclosed patio but he got over it very quickly. For appetizers we had the ribs and wings and both were very tasty ( I seriously considered getting an order of ribs to go).  For dinner I didn't love the sauce that my short rib was braised in and there was a lot of it but it was super tender. Around the table the red velvet waffles and chicken and mac and cheese was a hit. My son loved his grits but thought the seafood was a bit chewy which usual indicates that it is over cooked. He enjoyed his dessert I believe it was banana wontons oh and I had a bourbon mango something drink that hit the spot it was nice and strong.  Overall great time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I understand the concept of having a ""dress code"" to deter specific types of people or more importantly creating a certain kind of environment (non-hostile), but please train your staff to not only have concrete answers as to why these rules are set in place but more importantly as a business owner, BROADCAST this so that people are aware of this before spending money to get to your establishment, being seated, and then asked to leave because of a ""baseball cap"". And do realize the ""people"" be it black, white etc.. that you are attempting to attract come in different packages...sadly we won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Why allow me to make a reservation when the restaurant isn't open????? If I wanted to go to a bar I would have instead of this restaurant. I ultimately wasn't seated until 5:45.

The food wasn't mind blowing or even out of the ordinary for me but it was overly expensive at the same time. For those that may be wondering, the chicken in the chicken and waffles dish is not boneless. There is also no sauce except for maybe A1 or BBQ sauce that you can use for the blackened chicken dish. When we had it it was extremely dry and bland. At the same time, this place is a little on the pricey side.

Electa T.,/user_details?userid=2QX-lOU8DV7KoBesJY2sYg,"Morrisville, NC",4/22/2018,3.0,I've been here at least an dozen times and last night was by far my most lackluster experience. I've start by saving the food was great as per the usually but everything else let something to be desired. I brought some friends from Long Island and had raved about this place. We have reservations for 8pm and showed up on time and we're told they were seating some larger parties and it would be a little while. Ok fine it's a Saturday it was busy. We did not get seated for 45 mins with very little communication from the hostess about the delay. The whole point of reservations is so you don't have to wait. We finally sat and were starving the waiter came over quick enough and took our appetizer order and things seemed to be going ok. We had to ask for water at least 3 times when our cups were empty. Our drinks came with no straws we had to ask for some and wait. Our waiter was friendly enough but a little scatterbrained not sure if he had a lot of tables. Our food took 45 mins to come out. We were so hungry by the time it came all and all the whole dinner experience took 2.5 hours from start to finish. The people sitting to our left said it took 30 mins to get a sprite and the women next to me waited 15 mins for syrup for her chicken and waffles. I really hope the service improves because we would love to return unfortunately this was a very bad first impression for our guests.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

As we were waiting for our order two ladies sat next to us, they were celebrating a birthday, their waiter asked If they would like something to drink one of the ladies asked what kind of red wine they have he said he would be right back, upon his return he informed them that they were out of red wine in which they responded with ""Awww"". A few seconds later a gentlemen (Maurice, Mgr.) walks to their table and asked if they were okay and one of the ladies said ""Yes, but a little disappointed that there is no red wine"" he responded with an unwelcoming tone with the reason is that ""they are going to start selling a new line of wines"". He was very unapologetic, with no empathy or care. The two ladies tried to brush his rudness off so they ordered a Cosmopolitan, now I'm no drinker, but shouldn't that come in a martini glass??? Well it came in a shot glass.  Now our food arrived and let me say the pork chops were well seasoned, oh how I wished the seasoning would have mixed with the collard greens and where was the garlic in the mashed potatoes?

I ordered the bbq chicken with mashed potatoes and string beans. I was able to try their red velvet waffle and wished I order that as well! Best Mac n Cheese I've ever had! Their mac n cheese is a very large portion so I suggest to order it for 2!

They offer happy hour on drinks which the rum punch option was delicious. The margarita look more like a sample. For food, we tried the cornbread as an app and it came with a tasty butter but the butter was cold and took a while to melt. I ordered the fish and dirty rice the rice was more of a veggie rice than dirty rice I had to add salt to it for flavor. The fish was good. This entree was $33 and I wish I could have said it was great! My husband had the filet and Mac and cheese. It was good. I appreciated they cooked his filet at the right temp.

With that, the next stop was SoCoBK. This place is small and very noisy, but cute. It sort of has a modern industrial feel and there is outdoor seating in the rear. The staff was polite and on point. The food was pretty good as well. The mac n cheese that everyone raves about was just okay to me. It is seasoned with some garlic powder like flavor and it's just a bad move in my opinion. The shrimp appetizer was burnt on the outside and raw on the inside like they had been fried in grease that was too hot and did not cook long enough. The sweet potato pancakes and the lobster/shrimp & grits were delish! Overall, I give this spot 3 out of 5 stars.

Kimberly K.,/user_details?userid=_qYjW9xj6ndi1puZ6GxQkQ,"Plainview, NY",1/9/2017,5.0,"I came to this restaurant a long time ago but I can't get the flavors of the dishes that I ordered out of my head (which explains this very belated review). I ordered the chicken + red waffles (this was my very first chicken and waffles experience) and upon first bite- I was hooked. Of course after such a pleasant first time experience, I started ordering it at every restaurant I went to but stopped after a few times. The chicken and waffles at other restaurants was nowhere near par with the one here. The chicken was absolutely tender and it wasn't strenuous trying to eat through it. The red velvet waffles was packed with more sweetness than regular waffles, which made it pair so perfectly with the saltiness of the chicken. The second dish that I ordered was the Mac and cheese and it had me putting all the pieces of the puzzle together in my head: I now understand why soul food is such a hit to so many people (and I started planning my next visit back to SoCo). Unfortunately, this spot is pretty far from where I live and painstakingly long of a commute but I haven't forgotten about you, SoCo.

P K.,/user_details?userid=eOeqBGKZpRGwn3suVy_xBQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/6/2018,1.0,"On Saturday 5/5/18 at approx. 10:40pm I ordered food and nearly 50 mins later. I'm wondering where's the food?! (Two orders of split lobster tail, shrimp and grits) No update from the waitress at no time. I ask for a manager and then she comes over said let me look into it and then advised me that the server (Crystal) forgot to put the order in. That's absolutely unacceptable. I observe a couple that was seated prior to us wait for their food, get served, have their drinks, pay for the check and leave. Shortly after a group of ladies sit at a table adjacent to us. Get served their drinks and order their food, get served (Chicken and waffles, string beans, Mac n cheese, etc.) We conversed with them and they were shocked that we didn't receive our food yet and they got theirs. The manager comps two drinks one for me and my lady. She had been here a few times and told me how good the dish that we ordered was, but this was my first time. The food comes over an hour later. The server has the nerve at this point to ask is everything okay. I've been to establishments in different countries and have received better service then this. I also worked in customer service for many years and wouldn't even think about doing this to a customer. There was no satisfaction. I feel like I should of been compensated for those meals. I think upper management should take a closer look at the customer experience because I won't recommend any of my friends eating at SOCOBk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Dominique B.,/user_details?userid=RrwxdIcB9R93pAkIISa-dQ,"Manhattan, NY",10/1/2013,3.0,"Made 2 pm reservations to come here with friends on Sunday for a hungover brunch. Unfortunately, I missed my reservation and had to wait, but the host was really nice and accommodated my request to sit outside. After about a half hour wait, we were seated outside. I already knew I wanted to try out the red velvet waffle and fried chicken. We got two orders of that mac and cheese and free cornbread from checking on Yelp. Everything was very good. Their alcohol brunch is on Saturdays. $12 for unlimited mimosas. The drinks are an average of $13 individually. I opted out of drinking while a friend got a Bloody Mary. I took a sip and it was so spicy. I wasn't a fan, but my friend loved it. Usually I'm a little tipsy at brunch or straight up drunk so everything is delicious, but since I decided not to drink (bc I'm cheap) and I was hungover I was a little more critical than usual. The cornbread was exceptional though. Served with melted butter it was the best I've ever had. Three perfect cornbread muffins was great for the three of us. Not too dry, not too corny (yeah I said that), it was definitely a hit. The outer layer of the Mac and cheese that was baked to perfection was delicious. I wasn't crazy about the inner layer. The Mac was made with a lot of garlic and I can easily describe the inside as creamy garlic noodles. The main event, the red velvet waffle and buttermilk fried chicken was very good, but definitely overhyped. The waffle is good. The red velvet is more subtle than it appears which is good, because it's not dessert. The fried chicken is crispy on the outside, but also a little bit dry on the inside. Next time I would come back on a Saturday for alcohol and try out the wings and other things I saw the people around me eating.

The mash potatoes were average. The collard greens were inedible to me, it was more like a salad, too crispy,  not done enough.  My friend had the same issue with her collard greens. I asked for all white meat chicken and was given a thigh amongst 3 pieces.  Also the chicken was pink near the bone,  the manager attributed it to marinating the meat in a paprika type seasoning?

I was finally greeted by someone, I'm assuming she was the host and she was absolutely RUDE she raised her brows and looked at me like I just did not belong in there and asked me what I was doing? Uhmmm, trying to eat???! I told her I was looking to be seated for 3 and she walked away from me and came back a couple minutes later and asked me the same question and walked away AGAIN. She was so rude and did not try to help me AT ALL. I ended up walking out and taking my business elsewhere. I was a little disappointed because I really wanted to try their food... soooo I just recently decided to order some food through ubereats (not sure if it was ubereats or doordash because I use them both pretty frequently) and my food came on time, but it was not that great... it was honestly pretty average and I don't really understand the hype about it.

Shanequa P.,/user_details?userid=AC5t6JZ2UiSAfJYbl-r0Sg,"Queens Village, NY",5/29/2018,1.0,On Saturday 5/26 @7:45PM I arrived for a 13 party reservation for 8pm. I madethis reservation on 4/18/18 which was over a month ago being sepcific on the back table I wanted for my husbands birthday dinner. Upon arrival I realized the table I had reserved was being given to another party although I was 15 minutes early for my reservations. My party ended up having to be seated elsewhere which was the first issue but I decided to let it go to enjoy the night. We were not seated at the other table until 9PM. At this time we all are already hungry but happy to be seated none the less. From arriving at 7:45PM by the third hour at 11:20PM all our party recieved were salad and appetizers. During our visit the owners were in the building and not one person apologized for the lengthy wait or gave a time frame on the entrees arriving. My party ended up leaving after 3.5 hours and never recieved our dinner. I sent a long email to manager and have yet to recieve a respone nor was there any sympathy or apologizes from staff for the 3.5 hour wait. If your celebrating anything don't waste your time coming here.

Kerry R.,/user_details?userid=yZ554MpPJ0t1hZKNs_oWig,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",4/29/2018,3.0,"Went here for my birthday brunch with group of friends on April 22nd.  It was picked mainly because it was one of the few brunch places that I could find that took a reservation for Sunday brunch. I also know it was trendy fun atmosphere with music and vibe and a mainly African American crowd which is what I wanted. I also saw they had bottomless mimosas promoted for brunch but when we got there we found it that is only Saturdays not Sundays....boomer..  This was my 3rd time eating here -  twice for dinner before this date.   And the food gets a solid C at best . Not horrible but nothing special.   I have tasted the chicken and waffles, the shrimp and grits , the salmon and the french toast.  Nothing was really special.   The only exception was the mussels my table shared for  appetizer which  was very good and the rum punch - which was absolutely  perfect.  We ordered 3 rounds of  the rum punch pitchers $35 each pitcher amongst all 6 of us.   We thought being a birthday celebration that So Co could at least give us a deal or special of some sort especially with a $400 bill.   When we asked the manager if we could even get a round of drinks  for the birthday , he said no.  So please note So Co gives nothing special for birthdays not even a free dessert.    Our waiter was excellent and fun - even singing me happy birthday while I did my tipsy dance.   Overall So Co is cool if you have big group and want a reservation and not chance a long wait .  Its a cool vibe but the food isn't special .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered the Mac n Cheese, braised molasses short rib, the salmon , Corn bread and the okra and tomatoes. Let's first start with the Mac N Cheese, I would give it a 3 out of 5, it's creamy and slightly cheesy but it has an underlining taste of garlic or some sort of flavoring herb/spice of some kind, which I am not particularly fond of. I don't like the after taste it leaves on my tongue, like msg. The braised molasses was good, average flavored meal with mash potatoes and cheap broccoli or string beans. I didn't finish that meal because the taste become, too redundant and boring. The salmon dish , had absolutely no flavor, bland and horrible and the collard greens mix with the mass potatoes tasted too wet and flavorless ( it looks good but it doesn't taste good). A couple Parallel to us ordered the shrimp/lobster and grits for $29.00 , which only came with grits not costing more than 1 dollar 3 medium size shrimps (YES 3) and 1-2 inch's of microscopic lobster tail, (not 1/2 a lobster)  the female was very unpleased with the portion of her meal and she made it known. The cornbread was dry and the only thing I enjoyed was the okra and tomatoes, I don't see what all the rant is about this place, the food is overpriced for the portion, bland, or has some type of flavoring the decor is trendy but cheap (concrete floors), I mean really, the place looks like a trendy cafeteria.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Our first impressions were that it was slightly crowded and it seemed fancy. The host never asked us if we were comfortable inside or outside the patio - she just sat us outside. Our server was very friendly and kind. Very accommodating to our needs. We had the option of different types of waters: tap, bottled and one thing else I forgot. The brunch menu was expensive $17 for a b54 burger without cheese. $2 to add bacon, $1 to add white cheddar cheese with Parmesan French fries. My least favorite thing was the French fries- didn't have salt on it just Parmesan.

I had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken/Red Velvet Waffles, Aunt Cruz's Mac & Cheese. First the spicy chicken was prepared a little well too done for me to appreciate its flavor. The Red Velvet waffles looked appealing but was lacking in taste. Last, Aunt Cruz's Mac & Melba's was tremendous in a miniature skillet but ate like a casserole. The beef short ribs were seared just a tad bit over blackened. Since I was celebrating my 25th Wedding Anniversary, I had what was supposably their best sparkly white wine turnt out to be bittersweet. But I would like to add that my server (Amy) was courteous, attentive and seemed caring, so I made no complaints. The decor and ambience was somewhat Applebee's- ish.

First off, the wait for the food was very long and certain important details like for example: my girlfriend is pregnant and she must have very well done steak was still mess up after that long wait. And when called and let known that she is pregnant and that the meat needs to be very well done. We had to wait another 30min-1hour and the steak was burn on top, but inside was still bloody. So finally we had to get the manager to deal with this and have him take the steak away and just have a complete different order which didn't take too long as the other orders.

I made reservations for a party of 11 and we waited over 90 minutes for our food to come out. The party of 7 seated next to us came 30 minutes after we arrived and received their food before us. When our food finally came out one of the orders was ""allegedly"" given to another table and they expected us to wait another 15 minutes for that person to receive their food. And when the food finally came it was cold and not one person at the table was satisfied with their food. We waited forever for food that didn't taste good! When we voiced our concerns to the manager his resolution was to take the gratuity off the bill so we could decide what we wanted to tip our waitress. Why put the responsibility solely on the waitress? She doesn't cook the food or run the kitchen?!

Ashlea R.,/user_details?userid=9qORB-CgvRweozXa5N4wiA,"Elmont, NY",7/8/2015,4.0,I'm giving the food 5 stars because the macaroni and cheese was AMAZING. It comes out in cute individual pots and the cheese on top is so crispy and delicious. It has really good flavor. Some Mac and cheeses are bland and dry but not at Soco! We also tried the chicken and red velvet waffle and the jambalaya. I'm not sure what's the hype about with the chicken and waffles. I've had better. It's just okay for me. Maybe because it came out cold after we waited about 45 minutes for the food. But that's okay because the macaroni and cheese made up for it. The server was okay as well. We were in a hurry to leave and were trying to get the check but the waiter was nowhere to be found.

My visit here left a lot to be desired. I'm not sure if it's because I can cook well or if I'm just a food snob. There was a very minimal wait time because I went ahead and made reservations after reading horror stories about people waiting in line for hours. For my appetizer I chose the Nola mussels and my friend got the California sushi rolls. We didn't have to wait too long for our appetizers luckily because I was starving. My mussels tasted decent, however some of them were a bit gritty. I know I should've sent them back but I didn't...anyway I ordered the red velvet waffles and chicken for my entree.  The red velvet waffles just tasted like regular waffles, I'm guessing there isn't any cocoa just red food coloring. I ordered white meat chicken with it which oddly Costs extra(3$ up charge which waa magically 4$ on the bill) which was a little pink inside. The seasoning on the fully cooked peices I ate was flavorful. The scenery and ambience of the restaurant is very nice but I think it's overrated overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered the famous red velvet chicken and waffle dish.  The real appeal for me was the red velvet waffle and while it was good, it was nothing to run to yelp about, so that I could write a review and give it 5 stars.  I know there are other chicken and waffle dishes in the city that do make you do just that.  My caramel martini drink was watered down and the service was meh.

It's like every Real Housewives and Love and Hip Hop wannabe must eat here.  It's a platform to stunt and front. This culminated in a shootout that the establishment did an excellent job of keeping under wraps. When I go out I wanna just chill, eat a great meal and sip on some good drinks.  SoCo has the elements but I'm concerned someone's lace front weave, fake eyelashes or Lee press on nails might end up in my plate.

I really loved my nola food when I visited and this place definitely brings it home. The chicken and waffles is O-M-G so so good! The shrimp and grits, is W-O-W and the hash that we had was awesome. There isn't a wait when I went and it can get a bit loud but thats because everyone is enjoying their food.

Tina D.,/user_details?userid=1uktnDzIN0EPSqI9mphegQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/15/2015,1.0,I will never be returning to this restaurant because it's very over hyped and not worth it AT ALL! The service here is not good. They are very disorganized the server was not attentive and the food was very mediocre. The drinks didn't taste like they had any alcohol in them and they are over priced. The only good thing about my experience here was they had a man playing a violin to popular songs and he was talented. Half the staff was standing around doing nothing and it was difficult to get the servers attention to ask for anything. I would never eat here again or recommend it to anyone. They need better service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Why was EVERYTHING a dollar more than it was listed on the menu? We got charged $9 more than we were supposed to pay, a dollar for each dish we ordered. Water came late. Plates came late.

We had chicken and red velvet waffles. The chicken was amazing. I really like the frying flour they use. Also had the Bourbon Street eggs Benedict.

As it usually is there were people waiting inside and outside for a table - the wait we were told was about 45mins. Luckily, we snatched two open bar seats and sat down. The bartender was great, I should have gotten her name to give her a shoutout. She was making some really interesting drinks and entertained all of my questions as she was doing her job. I originally wasn't drinking but i convinced myself to try their bloody mary and boy I was not disappointed. Their mix is really good. I wanted to order one of everything on the menu to taste them as they all sounded amazingly good. We ended up ordering the chicken and waffles, and the omlet to get some healthy in.The food didnt come out that fast, but we expected that because of how busyu it was. I have had my share of chicken and waffles and this one takes the red velet cake! The waffle is cooked to perfection and the syrup is perfect. My chicken did come out a little undercooked for my eyes, and our bartender apologized multiples and sent it right back. It came out fresh and perfect!

I specifically asked for a table in the back because we are with children and a pregnant women.

Only thing I wasn't too fond of was that they automatically added a gratuity charge to your bill. I'm not sure if this is something that is charged regardless, after a number of people are at a table or the amount of the bill. But there was four people in my party and the bill came up to a little over $200. They charged a 25 dollar tip into the total and also added a tip line on the credit card receipt.

My party and I missed the brunch time before 3:30PM by 10 mins and had to until 5:46 PM to be seated -__-. Expectations were set high so I waited patently because of the reviews and the place was packed so i figured it would be great. My waitress was very nice and informative about the menu. I ordered the red velvet waffles with fried chicken. The presentation was okay but i guess they've gotten lazy overtime because i didn't get my strawberries. Also the waffle was very good but the chicken was very bland and regular. Thats why I give soco 3 stars but the live violin was pretty cool 2.

The place quickly became packed within a 15 minute window. My friends ate there before so I knew that I was in store for some really good soul food. I ordered the short ribs which came with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Our table ordered a pitcher of sangria which was also pretty tasty and had a nice ginger spin to it. The food was delicious and so was the ambience. My only reservation was that they only brought us out six pieces of cornbread and when we inquired about the seven piece of cornbread being that we had seven people with us they told us it would be an extra charge. Rule of advice...if seven people are eating at your establishment and spending hundreds of dollars don't be skimpy on the cornbread it's very tacky.

My friends and I had a reservation at 6pm. They left me a voicemail around 5pm mentioning the kitchen will be closed until 630pm, so we arrived at 615pm to check in with the host.

Oh, and they didn't have any chicken tonight (aka half the menu). My sis and I ordered the jambalaya and it was the worst jambalaya I've ever had (and for $24? What a joke!).

Kam w.,/user_details?userid=qqTm16tEF91EwAWXStn6pg,"Brooklyn, NY",6/11/2014,3.0,For a place that serve soul food they try to put a twist on it. Many enjoy their grits and shrimps others enjoy their red velvet pancakes and fried chicken. The bathroom area is interesting and different than you're use to. Their out door seating is refreshing and their drinks are good. I would not recommend their burger though it was very dry even though they tried to jazz it up. For me personally that was not the way to go. Their Mac and cheese is pretty good the corn bread is good as well. The atmosphere is noisy and they tend to play loud music at night. The crowd is mixed due to the neighborhood. It is a good place to enjoy,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Love the back covered patio. The food and drinks were delicious and clearly prepared with care. While the service was friendly, it was very slow from the moment we sat down to the moment we received the bill. I think this is largely due to the fact that the gratuity is built in for parties larger than two. We were very put off by this, as we do tip well if the level of service warrants it. Here, there is no incentive for a server to provide excellent service because they know the 18% or 20% will automatically be added on. In addition to that, there is an additional tip option added, which seems like one could easily not realize the gratuity has already been added and accidentally tip twice. Generally, just not a cool feeling to have as a customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The chicken was good but I've had better. Due to the hype, I expected more of the chicken and waffles. The fries however, are very good! While they are a bit salty, I enjoyed them a lot. The peach iced tea is also good. I chose another iced tea drink and ended up drinking my friends peach tea :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

If you open at 5 during the week and the average person gets off of work at 5 that means you really don't want to serve discounted drinks. There are a million restaurants in Brooklyn, and in this immediate vicinity, that have Happy Hour until 7. The menu items are expensive enough - like now the mac and cheese is $10 (LMBO) so you mean to tell me I can't have a Mardi Gras for $7 if I come after 6?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Ashleigh G.,/user_details?userid=Q5aw3N6HoTiGfTkNarnJJA,"Camarillo, CA",2/19/2016,3.0,"Since I can't give it a 2.5 I'll round up to 3. My husband and I went to SoCo Valentine's Day (freezing I might add) for some good ole soul food. When we arrived I instantly was digging the ambiance! It was larger than I thought and they were playing 90's-early 2000's R &B. Let the choir say Yaaaaas! We were a little early for our reservation (subway actually did its job) and waited roughly 10 minutes. We were then seated and spent quite a bit of time analyzing the menu. Everything  looked great, minus the 20% gratuity that was going to be added on all checks, regardless of party size. Also, any alcoholic specialty drink could not be returned. What?? I've never seen that before, but since this place has high ratings they must be doing something right, right? Well the drinks came and we weren't that impressed. My husband had a drink that could best be described as Hennessy and fruit punch. The fruit punch taste completely overwhelmed the drink. Disappointing. I ordered the Fried Chicken & Red Velvet Waffle, hubs got the Jambalaya and a side of greens. The greens weren't right. I took one bite, and they tasted strangely sweet. No seasoning, and definitely no ham hock! My fried chicken pieces were tiny and bland. I needed large quantities of hot sauce to even make this meal appealing to me. My husband's meal was spot on, I think all the seasoning went into that meal smh. The waiter started off ok, but he disappeared for long periods of time. He failed to mention the specials which I heard a different waiter tell his section so that was disappointing. Overall, this was the most disappointing meal we had when we visited NYC over the weekend. The next time we visit maybe we will go back, but I definitely won't have the chicken.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Buffy P.,/user_details?userid=qoPNxPJcw3PBzFxDUCimvw,"Baltimore, MD",9/22/2014,5.0,After reading so many great reviews on this place we ventured out of our cozy bay ridge and decided to give brunch a try. SOOO very glad we did!! There was a wait when we got there around 12:30 which we expected so we saddled up to the bar and were offered to have brunch there. Sure!! No wait! Our bartender/server was Sumaiya and she was PHENOMENAL. Her suggestions on drinks and food were on point. I had the hibiscus margarita and my bf had the strawberry moonshine. Both delicious! I ordered the crawfish eggs Benedict and he had the crowd favorite of fried chicken and waffle but it's a RED VELVET waffle! On her suggestion we got a side of the Mac n cheese. To call it a side doesn't do it justice because it's a meal on its own! My bf doesn't really like waffles but these waffles made him a believer! Now he says he just likes THESE waffles. They were fluffy and perfect! My Benedict was amazing with perfectly poached eggs and an old bay hollandaise that was beyond good! We will definitely be back and most likely for dinner next time!! Well done!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Shativea P.,/user_details?userid=J0OVaDXxsooWmNYB9vM_-g,"Brooklyn, NY",12/6/2016,1.0,"Okay so where do I begin. SoCo has earned its way to my list of  worst restaurant experiences ever. I went there the other night with my sister, mother and sister in law (who by the way came all the way from California). I heard so much great things about this place and thought it was a good place to get dinner on my sister in law's last night in Brooklyn. The horrible experience started as soon as I walked through those stupid doors. The owner was there ,who by the way is clearly an incompetent jackass, who before I got my big toe through the door told me that I had to take off my hat. Mind you it was not a pretty sight under this hat lmbo but anyway like why should I have to take off my hat like it's not a club and I'm not a guy. He really pissed me off with his useless ass just pacing back and forth watching the Knicks play basketball. If he wanted to be there so bad he should have bought a damn ticket to MSG instead of being at the restaurant pissing off customers. So last forward then it got time to order and I had a choice of different types of water so I chose Distilled. I'm not sure what the difference was but it sounded better than tap water but not as boogie as sparkling. What pissed me off is when I seen the bill the damn bottle of water was $6!! If I knew that my ass would have drank the water straight from the pipe if it meant it was gonna be free shittt. But anyway let me rewind to the biggest thing that oissed me off which was what I ordered. I ordered the Pork Chops, which sounded delicious from the description of the meal..... BUT IT WASNT. It was the toughest piece of meat I have ever come across. Literally inedible and clearly not cooked. Which sucked because my mother and I had ordered the same thing and both were the same. We even sent it back and I swear when they sent another one to our table, I swear to you the meat was tougher than the first piece they took back. The only thing that was half decent that I ate that night was the order of max and cheese that I had on the side. I swear that is the only reason I gave this place ONE STAR and also the fact that it is the lowest star I can give anyway, lucky bastards. But anyway STEER CLEAR FROM THIS PLACE, I WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered steak which came with potatoes and collard greens. The steak was decent along with the sides. My fried ordered short ribs which was perfection!! The next time I come here I will be ordering that. I rarely eat ribs so ordering that isn't something I would normally do but the piece she gave me was soft and seasoned extremely well.

It's pricey so make sure you walk with a good amount of money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered 2 appetizers the gumbo and the wings and never looked at each other or spoke during the time we were devouring it. For our entree we both had the blackened salmon which was cooked to perfection.

I can't say that I am mad about not getting in tho. My party of 3 was seated less than 5 minutes after arriving. I ordered the strawberry shortcake pancakes with a side of grits. The grits were amazingggggg. So much that the person I was with ended up ordering 2. Initially I loved the pancakes. It came topped with strawberries and whipped cream. They were delicious but after a while became too sweet for me to finish the entire plate. We also ordered a pitcher of rum punch. When we saw the size of the pitcher we didn't think it would be enough for the 3 of us but with the glasses we were given we each were able to have at least 3 drinks with still some left over in the pitcher. On this particular Sunday there was a violinist playing live music. Overall It was quite enjoyable.

And I wish I could stop there but unfortunately their service is below standard. I have never been asked to vacate a table, especially after spending more than $115.00 on the tab and an automatic 18% gratuity!!! And this was our second time returning in as many days.

I've heard good things about the food so I was so excited to finally get there and that was quickly dampened by the poor customer service. Upon entering the restaurant we were told abut the no hay policy so my boyfriend took off his hat. We get inside to the area where you designated to stand and wait to be seated, unfortunately no one was there but another couple also waiting to be seated. Now 5 minutes go by and numerous employees pass us NEVER ACKNOWLEDGING OUR PRESENCE.

Toni T.,/user_details?userid=jlr4fySpZ2tlRJMsgA0xNA,"Jacksonville, FL",9/7/2013,3.0,"Came for Sunday brunch with the chicken and waffles in mind,  thanks to previous Yelp reviews. The bf and I waited about 20 min. at the bar before we were alerted via a nifty text messaging service used by the host on his iPad mini that our table was ready. I thought I'd try a cocktail other than my typical mimosa to go with my brunch,  so I tried the red lemonade on the basis of our server's recommendations (along with a few other drinks she mentioned as ""stand outs""). The drink didn't wow me...there was a good amount of vodka but not enough lemonade to balance the flavor. Needless to say, I wish I had stuck with my mimosa. We both ordered the buttermilk chicken with red velvet waffles.  The waffles were just the right consistency (soft and fluffy) with enough hint of red velvet flavoring...the syrup complemented these flavors well.  The chicken tasted fresh and well seasoned.  I wish the skin was a bit crispier.  I also wish establishments that offer chicken & waffles on their menus would use white meat only.  While we're on the subject, it baffles me why a restaurant would serve bone-in chicken with waffles.  As a patron, I want to be able to cut my waffle and meat in similar portions and have them both on the same bite I take from my fork...a chicken bone makes this difficult to do. Aside from those gripes, the hosts and our server were pleasant.  We enjoyed the overall vibe of this spot.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I had to go for the chicken n' waffles since it was highly recommended and I was overjoyed.  The chicken had just the right amount of crispiness to it and it wasn't drenched in oil.

I had the salmon with whole green beans & yams along w. a side of Mac & cheese. The salmon was just right & the Mac & cheese was delicious as well cheesy but the yams were horrible (tasted straight out of the can. I couldn't think of a way to save them in order to eat them) & green beans coulda of been sautéed better. He had the red velvet waffles & fried chicken. He loved his meal & wasted no time digging in. We were both alittle disturbed with the water which we felt tasted like toilet water but the bottles in which they serve it is cute. He disliked the lemonade. The service was great & the establishment is very nice along with welcoming.

Isaiah B.,/user_details?userid=BqfjfsB-QEm6NArjFNnpBw,"Brooklyn, NY",4/17/2014,4.0,I love SoCo. Today was my first time having it and I finally found a new soul food restaurant that really is tasty. I was told every thing was good here and that was no lie. I started with the gumbo which was really tasty with a great broth and tasty sausage. My mother had the mussels which were AMAZING cream broth and was cooked to perfection. For entrees we both had the chicken with the red velvet waffle. The waffle was perfectly sweet and the chicken was okay hence one lower star. The service was great and the decor was on point.

Still loving that sock sangria too:) what i don't understand is how Soco's management continues to run the worst front of house in brooklyn. The two that were working when I was there were not on the same page at all and a big part of that has to do with communication. Speaking of which, the phone was ringing off the hook and even though the restaurant was empty (because your dinner service had not started yet) there was a lot of confusion by the front of the door. Telling people to sit at the bar to wait and then getting the people who just came through in the line at the door is not courteous to those that came earlier, come up with a system, like buzzers, or a list of names. Your staff can teeter on the edge of arrogant/rude and people continue to come here because it is a place to be ""seen"". rude staff detract to what you could have going, and smoothing out the process of seating people could also bring in more revenue. ALSO - change your voicemail and website that say your dinner service starts at 5:30pm... because really.... it starts at 6:00pm.

Cassandra H.,/user_details?userid=_6iQ8J6A5rUR8S2HgCu7Fw,"Brooklyn, NY",4/2/2015,3.0,"Decided to stop in for dinner with my girlfriend. Food was okay, décor was nice and service was great. Our server made sure to give us suggestion and all available options. One star for service :). The décor was nice and clean which lead to a very relaxed feel while enjoying ones meal. One star for the décor :). The food however was JUST OKAY. Literally just okay. Some dishes were not quite what one would expect but everyone is so focused on having this experience that left something to be desired. Me and my girlfriend had multiple dishes- the shrimp rolls, the corn bread, the mac and cheese, the chicken and waffles and the lobster shrimp and grits. The shrimp rolls, served with chopsticks :), were delicious; the flavors were there. However they should be named rolls with shrimp because although you can see the little piece of shrimp tucked into the roll it is merely half a bite which is disappointing. The cornbread was just okay, if that. Not something I would ever hope to eat again, overly sweetened and very dry. VERY DRY. Disappointing because I really do love cornbread. The Mac and cheese was presented nicely and came out piping hot. It was okay and the presentation is what had drawn us to it, the flavor, which is lacking, is what pushed me away. The fried chicken and waffles. SADLY THIS WAS MY DISH :(. The fried chicken was good and had, not loads of flavor, but depth of flavor and was cooked perfectly; commendable especially when one receives a mix of white and dark meat. It paired nicely with the syrup. THE RED VELVET WAFFLE HOWEVER..SHEESH! THERE WASN'T ENOUGH OF ANYTHING THAT COULD REVERSE THE FACT THAT I HAD BITTEN INTO IT. FLAVOR WISE, THEY COULD HAVE SOAKED IT IN POWERED SURGAR AND IT STILL COULD MASK THE DOUGHY, BLAND WAFFLE THAT WENT WELL WITH NOTHING, INCLUDING THE SYRUP. I suggest the restaurant allows its guest to have friend chicken with other sides or seriously fix the big chunk of dough they land on the plate to soak up the oil of the chicken. The waffle worked and tasted like a paper towel. May I have my money back for just the waffle please!. Lastly the lobster shrimp and grits, DELICIOUS. I would come here just for this dish alone.

I've had way better shrimp and grits, FQ wings were a treat and the Mac n Cheese was good. Now for the service that was probably the worst place I've ever seen for customer service. Our waitress lacked, her attitude was poor from the beginning. We finally get the bill and asked to have it split. She had a attitude and said ""we don't split bills""  say what? Ok so what do you do? Y'all when I tell you that I had to do math and sit and split the bill myself like an accountant!!!! THREE TIMES!!! I had to do their job because they weren't advanced enough to get it together. Mind you the manager came over and still didn't provide the right level of service or appreciation for our cooperation. Not one of them assisted to make the situation easier or smoother. Y'all I had to ask for more paper! The owner looked on the entire time like he was too good to involve himself. He was so inconsiderate and not helpful to his staff or us as patrons. If you go in large groups beware. Probably should have kept my reservation at Caribbean Social. They ruined a good food and drink experience. Soco needs to understand that customers service is a absolutely must. Black business/all business thrive when you respect and appreciate your staff and patrons.

She suggested the short ribs and it was so tender you didn't need a knife to cut it. Where they do that at??? Amazeballs!!! Only suggestion, don't make a reservation right after brunch.

First off let me just say everyone I encountered from when I walked into the door was amazing, and it being my first time there definitely was a reason to come again....Not everyone in my party was there so I waited at the bar....were only two bar stools available but guest were polite in moving over for some space which I started to need was more ppl in my party arrived. I got a few drinks....A milky one with a marshmallow, a Moscato, a Martini w/patron, and some nice fruity thing afterwards.....(Eduardo @the bar makes amazing drinks)...Now we are seated all the way in the back which was just so beautiful....As soon as we were seated we were met by the infamous Alex.(very popular on yelp) He was great eye candy for the night and gave us excellent service. Everyone order something different. My sister had the famous Fried Chicken and red velvet waffles which she said was sooo good(so I ordered one to go), one of good friends had the ribs and the other had bbq chicken. (Which by the looks of their plates they were both great) I had the blackened Salmon.....mmmmm I love Salmon, but that took my love to the next level. It was really good with the string beans and sweet potato mash. Gave me a recipe to take home and try with family. Definitely making this apart of my to go places in Brooklyn.

We both ordered the Mac and cheese which looked amazing but was extremely dry I had the chicken and red velvet waffles which was not that great at all my guest had the burger which she felt she could have gone to the diner and gotten better.

The food is ALWAYS hot, fresh and well seasoned. I cant say much about their service because their waiters are usually juggling many tables at once and if you need something extra or help etc. you kinda have to be the one to find them. I guess that's why they include tip in their bills cause they know their customer service is not the best but it's definitely not horrible. Every time I have been there (which is usually in the night), it was crowded so people are kinda on top of each other which is extremely annoying but all in all it's a great place to go out and eat and it gives off good vibes.

Waiter comes over unsure as to whether we could use this for brunch but then says that we can. Now that im home I just remembered that we never got it. As for food we all got the chicken and waffle. I've had better. The chicken was ok but something was weird with the consistency of the waffle. Also the soco carmel martini was super strong and sweet I wasnt a fan. Also we were sitting in the front and it was very annoying to see people come in and get turned away because the kitchen was closed during intermission and wouldnt open for another hr or so, even a poor pregnant lady got turned away. I just felt like they should have just locked the door but they really did just lose out on a bunch of business.

Two cocktails to try when visiting are darn I forgot the names but they were tasty. We each had an order of the famous red velvet waffles and chicken the chicken was moist and tender and the waffle was soft and tasty I do wish the chicken had been drained more I did not like the oil from the chicken on my waffle , I was so relieved to get maple syrup if it had been aunt Jemimah I would have got up and left I don't play that game.

I fully understand how NY restaurants pack people to get more customers than space should allow so that is not my gripe. While looking over the menu the waiter/bus boy bringing the people next to us their food puts their searing hot skillet of Mac and cheese about 2 inches from my face. Then the waiter/bus boy proceeds to drop a piping hot bowl of gumbo or jambalaya on to my leg and slashed 3 tables down. I understand that there are mistakes but he did not even apologize, no one from the restaurant got any napkins or anything for that matter. The customers next to me had to tend to my burn. About 10 mins later the manager of the night came and while trying to explain what happened the people next to me were cut off by him as if they were annoying him. We were then moved to another seat but it took forever to even get a drink out of them. Finally the check arrives...the manager of the night takes a whopping $17 in employee discount out of and a free glass of champagne for my troubles. They could've at least picked up our $82 check. I could've sued and that wouldn't certainly got more than $17.  Smh! I will never go back just because of that treatment.

The food (chicken & red velvet waffles and short rib hash) was outstanding. She then had the NERVE to add a 20% gratuity to a check for TWO people. I would've left a generous tip either way. Instead of making a scene and insisting they remove the unearned gratuity, I said a silent prayer for her & thanked God i don't have to take money I haven't earned from patrons of an establishment that offers me employment.

Even the Manager came to speak to me when H saw me waiting to make sure I was ok. it is a branch off from Negrils, one of my faves from yrs ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/soco-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I also ordered the wings with a side of collards.  Which I'm glad I did.  They came I  handy when I was stuck overnight at the airport due to my flight being canceled.  The sauced wings were delightful and the greens were hearty,  flavorful,  not greasy and still had a bite to them.  I have respect for any food that tastes great eight hours after being served and cold.  So overall,  I'd go again.

Melissa M.,/user_details?userid=c_HehSvyXdCB8vZ36gVd3Q,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",10/10/2017,1.0,"I don't even know where to start. Me and my bestfriend came here for my birthday brunch and the service today was horrible. First, we approached the front hostess who's name is Alissa and she was EXTREMELY rude might I add) and we asked to be seated for 2 people, she informed us that the kitchen was ...closed? nowhere does it state that they close from 3:30-6 .... brunch is over at 4 I believe and they open again 2 and half hours later! So by default we had to wait longer than we expected. Okay, no problem, so we sat at the bar until they reopened. We specifically asked the hostess Alissa if we needed to give a name so at least we would be called as soon as they were ready, she assured us it was not necessary. As 6 o'clock approached we seen the front of the restaurant getting crowded with people waiting, not thinking much of it, we assumed we had already checked in at the front verbally at least since we know she never wrote our name down. Anyway, long story short she seats everyone that JUST came in before even approaching us to ask if we were ready to be seated. I also heard another group of girls saying how the Hostess Alissa was rude so we shared stories. After approaching her and ASKING to be seated AGAIN she rolled her eyes and placed the menus at the table and pointed to where we would be sitting (didn't even walk us to the table like she did everyone else) by this time I was so bothered I asked to speak to the manager who is a bald light complexion man who after being told I asked for him specifically, took an hour to approach my table as I watched him ignore the waiter. I think he even got upset at the waiter who told him I asked for him because I later seen him apologizing. After he approached me so long after I asked to speak with him I just told him forget it. So here I am. A long time customer, GONE.

It was jam packed and super loud, which is to be expected from a popular restaurant like this. I ordered the famous chicken and red velvet waffles, which turned out to be only mediocre due to the fact that my waffle was first undercooked and then overcooked when it was made again. The chicken was phenomenal though. And my mom's burger was good too. Overall the food didn't blow me out of the park, except for that blueberry cheese cake (mouth-watering). However, the main reason why I give this place five stars is because the hospitality was fantastic! Even though it was super busy and rather hectic the staff managed to maintain their smiles and friendly gestures, especially our waiter, who was probably waiting 10 tables at once.

We were visiting some friends in Brooklyn and were actually told to check out SoCo by our Uber driver - so... 1 point for Ubers! We arrived at 12:00pm on a Saturday and the place was basically empty, so we were really lucky to get a seat in their little patio area in the back. We were quickly brought water and Bloody Mary's (duh) and it turns out that they have bottomless Mimosas till 1:00pm. I think you can probably guess where the rest of my morning went... Bob and I shared the sausage and grits and the red velvet waffle with fried chicken. Now, I am not usually someone who goes for these over the top waffle concoctions, but I do LOVE fried chicken and waffles - so what the heck! Bob's sausage and grits were phenomenal! The grits were nice and smooth and creamy, and the sausage was nice and spicy - the whole thing was done really well and it was very tasty. The chicken and waffle was spectacular! The chicken was seasoned well and was nice and crispy, and the red velvet waffle was almost a little cakey and had a nice yeasty flavor that wasn't too sweet so it went really well with the salty spicy chicken. Let's just say that I cleaned my entire plate, happily! The service was fabulous, the ambiance lovely and the food fantastic! What else can you really ask for in a brunch destination?

We were seated outside which to my surprise was covered with a glass top and it was very cool and air conditioned, which was great. I already knew what I wanted, lobster shrimp and grits and the mac and cheese. The shrimp and grits were not what I expected they lacked on taste and seasoning, the shrimp were good but the lobster tasted like it had freezer burn not fresh at all, I couldn't stop adding salt to it, I would never order it again but the mac and cheese is everything it is raved about, gooey and cheesy and full of flavor we loved it.

We sat by the door, that was not the best seating arrangement, but it did not take long for us to get comfortable for dinner. Our waiter was pleasant, knowledgeable, honest and cute. He made recommendations, suggestions and checked on us not too much and not too little (he added to the experience greatly) 3 of us had the fried chicken w/red velvet pancakes and 1 skirt steak. Of course the Mac & cheese. We had appetizer ribs and wings (appetizers are small portions). The food was hot, timely, tasty and gone in a flash once our palate realized it was being treated. I absolutely fell in love with this spot. It's not cheap, so don't bring pocket change. It's an excellent spot for a date with someone you like or going to dinner with your non-broke friends.

I know it's all the same to most people but I like fries better, so anyway I was told I couldn't substitute although they don't have that disclaimer printed on they're menu(strike #3).

With saying that yes, they may have a bouncer at the front door to ensure safety and yes their prices our higher- not only because of their renowned Chef but also because of the quality of ingredients you get.Once seated waiter starts you off with your own  craft of water and offers the drink menu with many refreshing and different spins on some classic beverages. The food and drink menu has slightly changed the different times I have eaten there and can only assume they change menu's with the seasons. As for the food, Ive had the shrimp & Lobster Grits, red velvet waffle with buttermilk chicken, their wings... and pretty much everything else on the menu. Some side items worth purchasing are their mac & cheese and cornbread (for $10 and $5 respectively) both have huge portions and are just to die for.

The f-que wings are perfectly smothered with a sweet chili sauce and served with tzatziki, which works incredibly well. Ok, so the pork chops were a bit overcooked for me, but they came with a heap of sweet potato mash, which made up for it. The chicken and red velvet waffle dish was good. It looks really amazing actually; the color contrast makes it pop visually. I think the waffle can be improved. It wasnt bad at all, it was just a bit generic; almost as if they used a boxed red velvet cake mix and poured it into a waffle iron. I doubt thats what theyre doing, but they can definitely make it pop more flavor-wise.

I'm not even sure why I returned. But I'm glad I did!!! Soco redeemed themselves in every way! The food and drinks were fantastic. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of Mac and cheese. The food came out piping hot and fresh. The first time around the chicken was bland. Not this time. The chicken was very tasty without being too salty. The waffles were fluffy and tasted better than ordinary Eggo waffles but not as sweet as a piece of red velvet cake. They were perfect this time around! The mac n cheese is a little pricey for a side ($9) but it was soooo worth it! And the portion is big enough to share. My cocktail of the night was the peach cobbler.

I found the food to be tasty and interesting. I am an absolute fan of soul food, so it's nice to have this restaurant added to the mix. SoCo attempts to put a spin on the meals that they serve. For example instead of shrimp and grits, it's lobster, shrimp and grits or instead of just chicken and waffles, it's chicken and red velvet waffles. I appreciate the effort as do my taste buds. The bartender was on point, even serving up ciders (w/alcohol) as is done in its original homes of Ireland and the UK-on ice. Unfortunately, I never like it on ice, so I would have appreciated being asked in advance, but I appreciate all efforts in the area of authenticity. Cool points for that!

Upon entering Soco you are transported to a swanky bar to the left and a host stand to the right. My spouse and I were quickly ushered to the Outdoor seating in the back of the restaurant.

The waitress was very energetic and offered great recommendations. I ordered the sangria, Mac n cheese, corn, and the red velvet waffles and fried chicken. My spouse ordered the peach Rum-Tini and the pork chops. The drinks arrived quickly. The sangria...pretty good; the rum-Tini...too sweet. Now....the food. I'm not sure what southen fused cuisine is but my chicken and waffles were standard fare. The chicken could hv used some seasoning salt and the red velvet waffles could hv used a little almond flavoring. The corn was delicious...grilled to perfection and the Mac n cheese....BABY! It was worth the trip. My spouse liked the pork chop but needed to add a bit of hot sauce. We finished off the meal with a brownie sundae (yummy).

My wife thought the collard greens were sweet. I thought they were kind of sweet but not excessively sweet and they didn't have red pepper flakes or even regular hot sauce to balance it out. The mac and cheese that most of the reviewers seem to rave about, is mediocre at best. They use these spiral noodles as opposed to regular elbows and it's just not really good. I say instead of trying to get fancy, just master making it normally. It was a 1-2 hour wait so we ended up ordering at the bar. As we were waiting for our food, a table became available we decided to take it. As we were going to our table, the hostess said that we had to close out the bill at the bar since we ordered everything at the bar. I thought it was kind of stupid to have to do that. I have never had to do that before. If you start out at the bar and then move to a table, of course you'll tip the bartender but you can always close out after you finish eating the way you normally would.

We just had a mini blizzard here in NY the day b4 so I wanted to make sure they were open so I cont'd  to call@ least til one(I am a stalker for good food:) It's def a journey getting to this place if you don't drive, but I didn't see any parking either so maybe a cab/car service is best. On arrival there was def a crowd,music was rockin . I went straight to the host area and gave them my name and they seated us in a timely fashion but they seated us near the kitchen but my gf was like its more room than the booths so I was cool with it. Our waitress arrived and poured 1 glass of water and disappeared. I'm like I knw she sees 2 ppl sitting here. So she comes bk to get our orders. I ordered the Soco Caramel Martini which was delicious, everythg mixed right(Im a Bartender:) My gf ordered a Sprite and it took 10 mins for her beverage to come. I then ordered the Creole Shrimp Gumbo, Mac n Cheez. My gf ordered FQue wings and Mac n Cheez.Our food came out promptly. The gumbo was delicious but there were no shrimp in my gumbo. I alerted the waitress and she went and told the chief, the chief sends her out with a plate of 2 shrimp. I'm thinkin really! So the mgr comes to me and says is that good, I'm like there should be 4/5 shrimp in gumbo. It is $9 whereas gumbo is usually $6/7 but I don't care abt price, Don't be stingy w/the shrimp!ijs So I will be bk for gumbo and I will be checking to make sure my shrimp is in there Soco: The Mac n Cheez was big enough for 2/3 ppl to enjoy. The mac was nuthin special, just basic mac n cheez. It wasn't nasty but it wasn't like ""I need one of those to go"" delicious.

The waiter was nice when he came around but not attentive in the least. We ordered appetizers we were really looking forward to. However, our entrees came before they did. So we had to cancel the appetizers as it didn't make sense to allow our entrees to get cold. Once we got our food everything changed. I had the blackened salmon and my husband had the skirt steak. The salmon was paired really well with sweet plantains and string beans. The food pairing choices were unique but enjoyable. His steak was cooked perfectly and the collards were pretty damn good. The waiter came back and put a damper on our evening. Will ordered the sweet potato pie. He enjoyed it. However he asked the waiter for vanilla ice cream instead of the peach. Te waiter said, ""don't worry. I got you"". The desert came out with the peach ice cream. The drinks on the other hand were a slam dunk. Shout out to the bartender that knows how to really make the drinks enjoyable. if my review were based solely on the food it would be a 5 star. But the service has a lot to do with enjoy ability.

Ava T.,/user_details?userid=ibuof7swfuhAMVOKtDzcaQ,"Springfield Gardens, NY",4/3/2015,1.0,The food is delicious however the service is poor. We waited a long time before a waiter came to the table. When it was time to pay for the food the wait was even longer after we provided the waiter with our cards. Apparently the waiter was waiting for the manager to reverse the charges because he charged the amounts on the wrong cards. The reason for the long wait was because the same thing happened to a different table and the people at the table was very upset so he was trying to resolve the issue. After he resolved that issue the waiter asked him to correct the charges and so we waited again until we decided to go and see what's going on. The manager and waiter passed us standing waiting on them and didn't even acknowledge us to let us know what's going on. When I started to get upset instead of him apologizing he was being defensive. The owner needed to change the management of this restaurant because there's no way I'll be going back here based on this horrible service.  We finished eating around 9pm and did not leave there until after 10pm. That's how long we had to wait to get the bill resolved.

The macaroni tasted like it had a lot of different unwanted ingredients. The service wasn't bad though, we missed our reservations and although the place was full it didn't take long for us to get a table. One thing though is that the tables are very close together. It feels like you're sitting at the same table with strangers. If anyone decides to go here I'd advice you to not get an appetizer if you are trying to save money especially if you're there with a group of friends. You will be full when you finish your appetizer and will have to take home barely touched meals plus the gratuity is very high so the more you order the more the gratuity is. Plus if you want to go here for your birthday make sure you have money for the tiny scoop of ice cream and little lava cake and I'm guessing for them to sing you happy birthday for 10 seconds because it's not free.

I was skeptical and ordered it medium rare anyway. When it arrived, visually it looked like it was prepackaged (frozen) not home made- there goes the sushi quality statement out of the window, and it was cooked well done. On my second visit, I ordered the Blackened Salmon. Again I was told that it was sushi quality salmon and I ordered it medium rare. It came out well done and tasted like cardboard- there was very little evidence seasonings associated with ""blackened"" anything. The best food item that I have tried thus far is the muscles in chicken andouille cream sauce, and I love the Mardis Gras drink.

The wait at SoCo was one hour and 15 minutes before we were seated, it was very crowded, very very noisy, no real waiting area until your seated at a table, people are just all over the place. Had to wait before you saw a server that was all over the place as well, also the hostess not very informative. Now onto the food,the food was okay literally, not great i've had much better. We ordered an appetizer named ""F-que wings"" what kind of name is that for wings??? and the butternut squash ravioli which was decent, my cousin orddered the red velvet waffles and chicken. She said the waffle was basic, regular and she didn't taste anything like red velvet and the chicken was okay. The bill for two people was high and they add tax to the meal, and expect a hefty gratuity tip. I didn't find this place to be great or spectacular like I read from previous reviews.

Noel tended to us at the bar and we each had a glass of wine and the short rib pizza which was truly AMAZING! Unfortunately the night went downhill from there. We decided that we wanted to be seated at a table after hearing from our friend that she was close by. I asked the hostess (she has an afro, dk her name) if we could be seated outside and she told me no because outside seating was reserved till 8pm although I only saw two people outside.  Ok fine, I then asked if we could be seated at a table indoors and then have a third chair brought to the table when my friend arrived. That was a problem as well. Finally we were seated and I wondered what happened to SoCo's Ladies Night aka SoSexy Thursdays'- no dj, a screaming baby, an Oxygen reality show being filmed, and to top it off a steady drift of a mildewy smell that was coming from their outdoor eating area! Ewww,  sooo not sexy and my blackened salmon was dry!!! And wth is going on with the people that patronize SoCo on a Thursday night?! I saw people in there with kids, undershirts, flipflops, hats,- one chick came in there with a fresh doobie from the salon, hair pins and all!

At first glance i wasn't sure if I would like it, but boy was I quickly proven wrong. It is food I had during my childhood but with a sophisticated twist. For those who know Persian cuisine, you would know that all Persians love a stew called ghormesabzi, Eyval took this dish an elevated it. Instead of having cubed beef in it. They place a beautiful osso bucco in the middle of the plate sured with the stew. What an amazing concept. Every dish they have,  is elevated Persian food. From their kashke bademjan to their kabab koobideh. Very well thought concept. Very cool ambiance, and a very interesting menu.

Next was a squash-feta-pomegranate salad which may have been the highlight of the night, the freshness of the herbs + sweet crunch of pomegranate and tamari seeds + roasted squash with salty feta was a dream combo. Then, the tamarind-glazed lamb ribs - a little sweet, a little spicy! - and potato tahdig with a plum sauce that made it feel almost like dessert.

As a huge fan of its sister restaurant, Sofreh, I had high expectations and Eyval certainly lived up to them. The barbari was crispy on the outside, pillowy on the inside, and paired perfectly with the mast-o-moosir. One of the stars of the show was the kashk-e-bademjan. I am Iranian and I have never seen this dish presented in this incredibly inventive way. I even tried duck in the fesenjoon for the first time, which came with fragrant rice. It was incredible and so indulgent. My friend and I both got the Conference of the Birds cocktails which I recommmend if you enjoy floral notes. It was just lovely.

All good but nothing memorable or stunning. Also each dish was small - and too salty. Except the bread, which was hot, not salty. The mushrooms were interesting but not substantial. None of the kebabs came on the stick. So what makes it a kebab -  Presumably they were cooked as a kebab? Overall great dining experience but too expensive for what it was - if you're willing to give up the pretty presentation, there are many places making similar food of the same quality for a fraction of the price. Also it's not ""iranian""- at best this is Persian inspired American food.

I will say, specifically, that the sullontang was divine: the meat was so tender it was falling off the bone, and the broth so rich that I found myself taking extra sips even after I was full. Additionally, in keeping with traditional Korean cuisine culture, we were served numerous delectable banchan as well to supplement our taste buds; and the water served was also the traditional Korean barley tea which I love so much.

Additionally, they have amazing quesadillas that costs between $4 and $5. I ordered pollo asada tacos, adobada tacos, and pollo asada quesadillas. Each dish was mouth watering delicious. The corn tortillas, meat, chopped cilantro, diced onions, sliced pineapple,and guacamole tasted extremely fresh. Everything is made fresh to order. My favorite item was the chicken quesadillas on flour tortilla. The flour tortilla was perfectly thin and layered with an equally thin coating of cheese. The restaurant and outdoor eating area was clean, allowing for adequate room to social distance. Staff also wore masks and required customers to do the same indoors.

I have tried all 4 types of tacos they have and my favorite has to be the pork because of sweetness from the pineapple and spicy sauce they put on it. The staff is super friendly and service is good. It can be a bit confusing if you are new to this place. You place your order and than give your ticket to the cook. It can be a bit anxious since a lot of people are waiting for their food to be called but there hasn't been a time when they gave your order to someone else. Definitely worth coming back.
