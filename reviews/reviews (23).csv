My husband ordered the pork chop and was not disappointed, as he is usually upset with portion sizes, this did not disappoint.

We watched as it was taken back, tasted by the chef, who was repulsed by it too. our drinks were good and the steak was okay, but after recommending what i thought was one the best restaurants in brooklyn to several friends, it really did feel like a let down. no fault to the staff or the chefs but i don't know. im just... saddened by the whole experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/arden-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Granted it was 6:15 but the place fills up early as the outdoor seating is wonderful for people watching during after work / early dinner hours. The service was excellent from the waitress to the busboys. Food was milanese italian style. A bit pricey but great for a neighborhood joint. Nice cocktail list. Pace of food was properly spaced. After being in the hamptons in the summer where the service is terrible and full of pretentious assholes it was nice to be back in brooklyn with some more diversity and nice people.

Laila P.,/user_details?userid=X81HHthtJLBJA3viHK5gWg,"New York, NY",4/22/2022,1.0,"I'm going to be honest here and tell you that I'm not really going to talk about the food. It was alright. I'm not a food critic and I'm not going to pretend to be. Was it worth the over $300 it cost? Not really, in my opinion. The steak was overwhelmingly salty, the portions were small and highly priced, the meringue was mostly whipped cream and I actually have no idea what part of it was meringue but I digress. I've had meals I enjoyed more for considerably less, but then again, my taste is not yours, and I am not going to impress it upon you. What I am going to talk about is the fact that Saraghina is one of the most egregious examples of  gentrification I have seen yet. The air is infected with a sort of wealthy self importance that I have never found even in small amounts to be pleasant, and especially not in this case, where it permeates the very tile. I was even rushed out after my exceptionally overpriced meal and told to leave because ""there are people waiting for your spot."" I am every bit sympathetic to accommodating other people, but the complete lack of tact with which it was brought up was palpable, like a cloying, sickly sweet perfume worn by someone with a demeanor that expresses cleanly and plainly that they think you are not worth their time. There are many beautiful and unique restaurants across New York City that display the vast array of cultures and people that live here. This embarrassingly over-gilded ""upper crust"" establishment is as far as anything can be from what makes NYC special, and I urge you to support smaller local businesses across the city that both need and actually deserve your patronage.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/saraghina-caff%C3%A8-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Hannah J.,/user_details?userid=v7yaJzY6E8h-zRbWXvbXtg,"Brooklyn, NY",5/2/2022,5.0,Kiki's is a special spot in the city. Love this gem and the food. I didn't get any pictures of the food because we absolutely devoured it but it is sooo tasty. It can be hard to get in but it seems to be a favorite of large groups. They have both sides of the street and the restaurant is unmarked other than the copious amounts of people spilling out onto the sidewalk and their doors being wide open for a glimpse inside. The tzatziki is to die for and the pita is so soft. I had the chicken with potatoes and the sauce really made the meal. The chicken also wasn't too dry. Inside there is a lot of energy and rustic decor.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The vegetables and feta tasted incredibly fresh. The fava, which was similar to hummus in its consistency, was delicious and creamy. The zucchini chips were fried and crisped to perfection, making it a perfect side dish that was difficult to stop eating. The shelled Sautéed Shrimp was well seasoned in a tasty creamy sauce.

We also got the Greek salad (horiatiki) which was fresh & delicious. We also enjoyed the octopus. The patates me agave were delicious and the eggs were perfectly cooked (not too runny). The honey mustard sauce with the fries was fabulous. For dinner, we have ordered the moussaka (eggplant, potatoes, & meat) & the lamb (amazing).

Maggie Z.,/user_details?userid=2-uP_Db0SeV721CBYdoZ3g,"Chicago, IL",11/19/2022,2.0,"The food was pretty bland and unseasoned. The grilled octopus was good in that it was tender, but we couldn't taste any other seasoning, only the lemon juice from what we squeezed. The portion of the octopus was also smaller than what was seen in the pictures, so I guess that's inflation for ya. We also ordered the pastichio plate and branzino. I didn't expect the pastichio to be sweet, and it tasted more like it was an apple pie, considering the cinnamon and brown sugar taste. The branzino was the highlight of the meal, but was still on the bland side. This dish came with a side of potatoes or rice, and we opted for the rice. This rice seemed to only rely on the sauce for flavoring, because it straight up tasted like tomato sauce. Additionally the service was flat out bad. The server never came up to us to ask how the food was, never asked if we needed anything else, and never came to refill our water. We were able to wave him down at the end, and even then he only asked if we were done and if he could take the plates away.

Vickie W.,/user_details?userid=v1wOhhRrjsQw6ppkkvk_Bg,"New York, NY",12/12/2020,5.0,"COVID-19 outdoor dining review: during the beginning of the pandemic, a friend and I got takeout from Kiki's (Greek salad, eggplant dip, and a side of fries) and ate everything with delight on a nearby bench. When they opened for outdoor dining this summer, I eagerly came back, and can report that this restaurant still knocks it out of the park. Getting a table both times I came for dinner was shockingly easy, even at prime time, as they have quite a few outdoor tables set up on the street. The setup feels very spacious, and they've been able to maintain the same cool but low-key vibe that made it so easy to while away hours here drinking their house wine and eating simple, excellent food. I've had most of the menu at this point, but faves are definitely the saganaki, moussaka, Greek salad, octopus, shrimp in the mustard-cider vinaigrette, avgolemono soup (pre-pandemic, I loved coming alone during the week and eating the soup + the octopus or shrimp with a book at the bar), roasted lemon potatoes, and my beloved cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'm no Greek connoisseur but we brought my Greek friend who said it was ""solid."" Guess he wasn't blown away, but I sure was. Especially at such a reasonable price point. Carafes of wine (1L) are ~$24! I highly recommend the saganaki if you like savory and sweet. The octopus is also great and lemony and so so tender. Also, tzaziki is crazy good and they bring charred breads/pita for dipping. Nice ambiance, like a dimly lit cavern in Europe.

Peggy C.,/user_details?userid=eRCQMWE2tNuN7hXKUUfymA,"Los Angeles, CA",2/11/2018,5.0,"Honestly, I don't normally even go for Greek food as my first choice, but on a recent trip to New York, Kiki's was by far the best meal I had and I LOVED it. It was just the perfect combination of great service, really fun atmosphere that made us feel like we had found something special, and fantastic food. My friend and I came in for dinner on a Sunday and luckily we managed to get seated immediately. Didn't have trouble finding the location - just be prepared to not be searching for a sign that says ""Kiki's"" (I'd suggest looking at photos of the exterior here on Yelp to help you). I love the decor, which is super charming - also, note to restaurants, the idea to stick a small shelf next to the table for condiments, silverware and the candle is so SO smart...more people got to do this! We ordered a spanikopita, whole branzino, moussaka, and the ekmek kataifi for dessert along with wine. All of the portions were massive but so good and hearty. The spanikopita was so good, the branzino was charred perfectly on the outside and moist on the inside. I've never had moussaka before, and I feel like it was similar to a shepard's pie (and delicious). We were so full we had trouble finishing the ekmek, but try we did since it was such a fun mix of flavors and textures. Our server was so lovely, and when he heard we were in town for a while, he quickly wrote down a list of other restaurants he recommended in the LES area. Just a crazy good experience all around, and I would definitely come again next trip.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

In any case, I found it and when we arrived on a Friday night close to 6:30PM, the place was quite empty. It did fill up as the night went on though. In any case, we were told to sit anywhere we'd like, so we did. I ordered the moussaka, and the food took a while to come out which was a good sign (or so I thought). My food was lukewarm, but the top of my moussaka was crunchy. I thought the balance of meat to potato to eggplant was not very good as there was way too much meat and not enough eggplant and potato. The flavor was just of beef which I guess is expected, and in general I thought it was just okay. Ambiance was alright but I could see the place being really dark if it were dark outside; since it was still light outside, this wasn't a problem. Service was acceptable as our waters were refilled appropriately, dishes were cleared when we were done, we were offered dessert, and we were given the check in at timely manner.

Their menu includes a lot of traditional greek items which sounds delicious. I was very close to ordering their octopus and a dessert but that would be way too much for me to eat during lunch.

I honestly don't get that freaked out my roaches (if it was a rodent, I would've been a lot more upset), but my friends were disgusted and squatted on their chairs.

We were told repeatedly when we called in that they don't take reservations for small groups. Fine, so we went early and got seated at a 4 person table for 5 people in our party. However, when a larger table opened up (seats 6), we asked the waiter if we could switch as it was hot and we have yet to get any of our food. Yet, we were told that the table is reserved (I thought no reservations?) and later, when the party showed up, it was 4 people (which they definitely could have sat at our table designed for 4). I'm not sure if they were just unwilling to accomodate our switch as they have already sat us or something didn't add up.

Rosie J.,/user_details?userid=514cnV0afo118Rut0ETc5w,"New York, NY",12/23/2017,3.0,i loved all the food but they're all small and pricey. i went in on a thursday night around 8pm. no wait. i was seated at the bar while a table was available. i ordered house wine which was not my taste so i would not recommend that. i started ordering the octopus. finished it very quickly because it was quite yummy and the dish was way too small. got seated and ordered the snapper. the snapper has a lot of meat but it also has a lot of bones if you're not into that. the potatoes that came along with this dish were literally 4 strips of potato wedges. i wasn't full so i ordered the meat dish which contained of 3 small beef patties and french fries. i enjoyed this dish more.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I already love Mediterranean food, but they do everything right. If you don't know where to start...get the octopus salad. It will change your life. Flavorful, grilled to perfection, and not dry in the least. I also got moussaka which was an explosion of delicious flavor. This had eggplant, potato, ground beef, and a healthy dollop of love.

We came on a Sunday night four girls and had to wait around 25 minutes. there was a line out the door but they said they'd call us when our table was ready. The wait was way less than she had indicated (45 min). The ambiance was extremely cute, almost cave like with 3 different sections of the restaurant and tables right in windows over the street. Aside from the ambiance, there was a lot left to be desired. We started out with the tzakziki, which was ok- probably the best thing. We then ordered what they said was like hummus, I think the fava dip. This was possibly the most disgusting hummus I've ever had. It was chalky and terrible tasting, no flavor. We also got the moussaka. This was also disgusting. It was smothered in some sort of cheese. We then got the octopus which was nothing special- straight octopus all minced up which was strange. The spanakopita was the only edible thing we ordered besides the tzakziki. Last we got the zucchini chips, which were way too fried for my liking. The service was slow we had to ask for help multiple times and the woman would not answer our questions about the menu. The only good thing was the wine- which was fairly inexpensive for a carafe (around 25).

Natasha B.,/user_details?userid=N8IJBENaNNEU4KoB4HYnVQ,"San Francisco, CA",3/21/2017,3.0,"I think this place is solid, I would say 3.5. It's got good energy, a lot of hip people, on a cool little street, it's lettering is Chinese to match the area and fast efficient service. The food is okay, at least what we had. The greek salad has all the makings of a great salad but I believe is prepared and therefore doesn't have the coolness and crunch that makes this salad perfect. It also needs more red wine vinegar. The feta and olives were good quality. Also the veggies are not cut quiet enough to mix them effectively. The grilled octopus tastes very good but definitely not fresh off the grilled, very moderately warmed, sitting out for some time temperature. The zuchinni chips are plentiful but are smushed together for some and not fried very crispy, I've usually had better. The mousakka was excellent. Nothing was at all wrong with this dish. The cheesecake was also very good but I'd like some fresh strawberries over the preserves. The wine tasted like I was in Greece again, it sent my senses whirling. They did card me which I took as a great compliment ;) I would prefer they were less timely/efficient and make my food fresh.

G T.,/user_details?userid=zVtIfa-2dBNunYWA36xLgA,"Manhattan, NY",4/29/2018,2.0,"I had the misfortune of having dinner here on a recent Saturday night at 6:30 PM.  The noise level was so high that the following day my throat was hoarse and my voice cracked. All of this just to try and have a conversation with the person sitting 20 inches away from me.  We sat at a table that was 20 inches wide so that my knees locked with the inner thighs of the person sitting across from me. There was a ceiling support pole directly in front of my face coming up through the table. We sat on high stools with no back so it was uncomfortable. They overstuffed the room with seats so there was no (and I do mean NO) room for the waiter to pass so each time the waiter went to another table he would have to ask patrons to move out of the way. The climate control system consisted of opening the door and windows to let in some fresh air and then closing them while the temperature rose to 86 degrees and then repeating the same cycle all over again until walking pneumonia set in.  I might have been willing to forgive all of the above had the food compensated for the apparent greed of the restaurant owner to put profit over palate. Not the case. The moussaka had a hard (and sometimes crunchy) thin béchamel layer when it should have featured a 2"" tall soft silkiness. It had pieces of meat instead of being ground as the traditional dish calls for.  Missing was a rich multilayered flavor profile because the seasoning was woefully underdeveloped and revealed a chef who obviously had no formal training in cooking.  That was no more evident than in the disappointing spanakopita (spinach pie) which lacked the expected dill, lemon, and tangy feta cheese flavors that should have made it an easy crowd pleaser.  The lamb chops were unremarkable and lacked seasoning.  How much could a little fresh oregano, basil or mint cost?  The pureed fava beans were unidentifiable in taste and texture and more suited to an infant's diet. The grilled octopus lacked a smoky flavor component to its skin and was obviously not marinated and prepped with fresh herbs prior to being grilled. The tzatziki was a missed opportunity to exhibit a balanced blend of garlic and dill. Instead it was a contrast between the bland and the blander.  The saganaki (fried cheese) appetizer was an abomination. It is supposed to be served flambe with warmed brandy instead it was just broiled. The ""cheese"" must have been a cheap knockoff because it lacked the strong flavor that the dish should command. How could they destroy fried cheese you may ask?  By placing it on a puddle of sweet honey.  Not even Winnie-the-Pooh would have liked it. The honey is unprecedented, unjustifiable and inexcusable. Saganaki is not intended as a dessert. The signature greek dessert, baklava, was underwhelming and unsubstantial in taste and portion size which in a way was a blessing to have less to suffer through. The galaktoboureko (semolina custard dessert in filo) dessert would have been fine had it not displayed a strong sour citrus flavor which made me wonder if it had gone bad.  Thankfully it was fresh and only the baker was bad.  On a positive note the fried zucchini chips with grated cheese were good but not good enough to redeem the multiple assaults to my mouth, body, eyes, and ears.  Perhaps this place may satisfy the uninitiated who may never have eaten at an authentic greek restaurant before and understandably have nothing better to compare it to. The owner may think doing something different is in good taste. But it just tastes bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Stefanos P.,/user_details?userid=BKNysd4omftTNjrHZTPswA,"Elmhurst, NY",6/15/2015,5.0,"Ok...lets start with this first...I was born and raised in Greece and lived there for 28 years which means i pretty familiar with what the real Greek food is.  So after being almost three years in New York finally we found Kiki's place which has 100% Greek recipes and the the food its really tasteful which makes u travel to Greece for a moment. We had mousaka, grilled octopus, greek salad,tirokauteri, ntakos salad, bifteki, saganaki cheese and pasta with shrimps...all of them were just perfect. I have been to many Greek restaurants and by far i believe that the place is the best. Traditional Greek food with a very cute and cozy environment...the staff are so welcome and the noise level is low which is a big plus for a restaurant in NY especially for those who want to enjoy their food in a quiet environment. And the prices are just unbelievable compared with the quantity and the quality of the food. So if u want a really good traditional restaurant here is the one...i will definitely go back. Cozy, friendly, nice music, quiet environment, excellent food, good prices.

Only decent thing is the eggplant appetizer. The fact they have no menu online and the idiotic attempt to make the place unique by saying greek food or whatever in chinese characters also makes the place hard to even find. When you go in you are served soda in mason jars which is annoying because there is nothing greek about that. Right now its crowded and popular but the novelty will die down for sure. By the way I only make mention of the hipster atmosphere because going there in general for anyone else ............you will not feel comfortable eating your meal. There is nothing about that warm greek hospitality and pride in their food about this place.

The corn tortillas, meat, chopped cilantro, diced onions, sliced pineapple,and guacamole tasted extremely fresh. Everything is made fresh to order. My favorite item was the chicken quesadillas on flour tortilla. The flour tortilla was perfectly thin and layered with an equally thin coating of cheese.

Very small menu, the pork being my favorite over the carne. The Quesadilla seems to be a larger taco, open and easier to eat standing... I'd recommend that to start with, choose either flour or corn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Come for the tacos-if you're a purist then don't get the works (salsa & guacamole at no extra cost) but getting everything is pretty darn good. You get a choice of corn of flour tortilla: get the corn. And ask for lime: you'll get a little bag filled with lime, chilies, and radish at no extra cost.

Luis M.,/user_details?userid=z6y50HKEHmOE42vbT1Rdbg,"Flushing, Queens, NY",5/31/2021,4.0,Pretty good spot. Tacos are tasty and the staff seemed cool. The tacos are on the small side and the after you order it's a little disorganized when they ask you what you want and if it's to go or stay. The person who takes your order should enter it according to how you want it to avoid all the disorder and crowd at the food counter.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I decided on getting the chicken and let me tell you something; I'm glad I ordered this. The cheese was delicious and the juices of the chicken were overflowing. The best I've ever had.
