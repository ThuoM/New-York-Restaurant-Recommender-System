Went with 3 friends and split everything family style. Started out with a bottle of Syrah which was extremely delicious. For starters, we ordered the whipped feta, side of cooked greens, eggplant and one of the specials (not on menu) the eggplant bruschetta. First of all, this pita bread was out of this world good. So warm, fresh and topped in a buttery coating. The rest of the apps also did not disappoint. Everything was flavored so well. For the mains, we ordered the chicken and mushroom pappardelle. Both just wow. Probably some of the best chicken I've ever had. The couscous and sauce that went with it couldn't have been a better combination.

Located in an unassuming corner space in the West Village, Balaboosta exudes a buzzy, romantic, downtown vibe that is truly infectious. We stopped in on a busy Saturday evening, and were seated at a fun little table near the back. I started with the Arak Nana, a play on a traditional Israeli arak cocktail, whereas she had a glass of white. I followed that up with a glass of fine Israeli white. Although the vegetarian options were limited, with the restaurant unfortunately running out of a few items, everything we had was incredible. We started with their perfect hummus and their creamy feta dip, drizzled with pomegranate molassses and raisins, which was the highlight of the meal. We followed that up with the delicious roasted cauliflower and roasted potatoes, and ended it with the baklava ice cream, a delicate phyllo pastry stuffed with light, honey and pistachio-flavored ice cream.

Michele S.,/user_details?userid=mukbs7Bj65O2fIVMi935nA,"Vienna, VA",6/26/2022,5.0,"I'm going to begin with: maybe this place isn't for everyone. I'm seeing some ignorant posts. We went to Balaboosta because we're familiar with Chef Einat Admony... and we love Israeli food. We also love her Taim falafel. But when we went last night to Balaboosta for the first time, we were sitting next to many ""first dates"" (an older couple 55+ on my left and 20 somethings on my right). There were a lot of New Yorkers trying to impress each other but thinking this was ""just Mediterranean"" and we literally heard one of the girls tell her date ""we can start with the hummus because that's what you do in 'places like this.' "" I wanted to ask her ""where else have you eaten like this? Greek? Lebanese?"" She just ordered everything on the appetizer list then stared at it when it hit the table.  Chef Einat has created a unique Yemeni Israeli home cooking restaurant. Should you get the hummus? Yes -- delicious. But don't miss the cauliflower with peanut tahini and BAMBA! (I need to try to replicate it at home!). The lamb was extraordinary. And we also had the stuffed cabbage -- which is more like a gigantic dolma than the ashkenazic version (there's no tomato sauce -- it's rice and raisins and savory goodness). The rice was fantastic too... crispy from the pan with dried fruit and pistachios. For cocktails -- we both had Tamar (like an old fashioned with rye, dates and ginger) -- we both loved. Overall: Highly recommended. Cool funky space with an awesome mural of the Chef and her Israeli birth certificate. It gets loud. Go later if you can (we had a reservation at 8pm).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/balaboosta-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We shared the daurade entree which was perhaps the least exciting dish of the bunch but still very good. I might recommend skipping the entrees and sticking to the amazing smaller plates.

ALL the tables on the first floor were empty, but when we asked to be seated there, we were told they were all booked and the restaurant doesn't seat parties of more than four on the first floor. Ridiculous! We suffered through excruciatingly slow service, with one inattentive waiter, and unremarkable dishes that just were not up to the standards of our previous visits.

Hong Kim L.,/user_details?userid=26zqTRlDqrUL3zTdYa_gTQ,"Brooklyn, NY",11/6/2022,3.0,"First time at a cozy Mexican restaurant in the Soho area. The outside does look fancy and inviting. We came here for a birthday party of 36 people. My friend booked for a Family Style Pre-Fixed Menu for $65 (alcohol not included). It is difficult to get a restaurant to secure a large party of this scale. We had to be seated at different tables (3 separate ones). Food wise everything was fantastic. What we had was the Shrimp Tacos, Tamales, Pinto Beans Guacamole, Seared Salmon, Churro Ice Cream, and the Chimichurri Steak. My deductions had to go with the portions offered to us. It is difficult to serve a party of 36 people but what I would've liked was to enjoy more heartier portions of the food. The other 2 tables was offered a nice amount of food but our table, at most each diner only had 2 bites to sample from each dish. And for the price we paid, it was hefty to pay over $100 for a small amount of food. It was my friend's birthday so I told myself the contributions was going towards his special day. But as a diner, I was expecting more. Maybe if I came on a small intimate dinner with a few diners, perhaps the portions would be better.

When I tell you this drink was mixed so well I mean it, I was super impressed, and I got mine with the mezcal preparation (they asked if I wanted tequila or mezcal) and it was sooo good!!!

Roxanne G.,/user_details?userid=OmXpyQ1R_P6pDd9Dl0_Mog,"Manhattan, NY",4/14/2023,5.0,"The hype is real! This place is hard to get into, but it's worth the wait. Laser Wolf is an Israeli skewer and kebab house and all the dishes are made to share. There's about 3 skewers in each order and they are massive. I would recommend 1-2 skewer dishes per person. The meals come out with about 10 different sides (Salatim), fresh hummus, and pita. We ordered the lamb kofta, lamb & beef koobedih, brisket, and salmon. They were all delicious, but I think the lamb and brisket were my two personal favorites. The Date-Harissa Wings and the French Fries were out of this world. The skewers and the salatim with the hummus and pita were way more than enough food, but I am glad we tried the Al la cart appetizers. They bring out a soft serve ice cream dipped in a tahini sesame sauce that is out of this world. Don't worry about not finishing all your sides and your meal, they give plenty of to go containers for you to take home the generous portions of food. On a nice day you will get a beautiful skyline view of Manhattan and in the summer the rooftop retracts. The roof and view is a vibe for sure. Our service was impeccable. Brian was so kind to us and explained all of the dishes in detail. Be sure to ask about how the French fries are made! Our waiter was also extremely attentive and super personable. I will definitely be back (if I can get in again!)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/laser-wolf-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Claire L.,/user_details?userid=kMPbIqznYvHGH_KjwsYMUA,"Brooklyn, NY",2/27/2023,5.0,"This place lives up to the hype and then some! We got the lamb and then instead of another meat dish did the sides for an extra person for $28 which was great. I'm not a huge meat eater so didn't need another meat dish but the lamb was excellent, it tasted really lamb-y in a great way. It was also a very nice sized portion. Our server Josh was excellent, super nice and fun, also gave great recommendations on the food and on the wine we got which was loved. The view was also incredible, we came in the winter so there is a plastic type thing making it stay warm but still able to see the view and that was just perfect. Dessert I was worried would just be an after thought but it had amazing unique flavors and was excellent.

Great atmostphere, location, view, service (with Brian). Girl folding towels a bit of a puss, with no smile and didn't seem to be happy....but I digress. Brian was just the right amount of smiles, service, interuption. The food of course was crazy unbelievable. 9-10 Israeli ""sides"" with the best pita bread EVER. We chose the steak (OMG spices are on par), and Brisket Kabob (delish typical kabob in my opinion)....the cocktails were very tasty and the Israeli Rose was delish. I think the soft serve was a perfect end to my birthday celebration (as much as others thought not), I loved the simplicity and instant gratification instead of perusing the menu for desserts.

Patrick K.,/user_details?userid=eXowZittWxMx-gtwb3Y-TQ,"Minneapolis, MN",12/10/2022,4.0,"The only reason I didn't give Laser Wolf  5 stars was because of the service. All the food was excellent and the restaurant has killer vibes. The Dry Aged T-Bone was one of the best steaks I have had in a long time and although not pictured, the Date Harissa Wings w/Tehina Ranch were a surprise stunner. Don't skip on the Amba-Spiced Eggplant dispute the steep price tag...it was a nice balance to the steak. I will say, wish the wine menu was a bit more exciting as well as the desserts, but at the end of the meal, all I could think about was the steak so it didn't matter much.

Kadeesha L.,/user_details?userid=t0yamaWKaSInp6AoVPmJZA,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9/16/2022,4.0,"This place has a lot going for it and is definitely a popular spot that is on a lot of folks list. The menu structure is almost as interesting as the view (unless of course you go on cloudy day as we did). On average without cocktails your meal will be about $55-58 per person and that is inclusive of a protein/veggie main with a side of basmati rice, appetizer and dessert. Really the only thing you pick is your main and the appetizer is the salatim. Fresh hot pita at your beck and call with all the dips and veggie toppings your heart could desire. More than enough for two people, we couldn't even finish it all and saw other folks taking a box to go. This was the saving grace of the meal because the main proteins were smaller than I imagined. We got the beef/lamb kebab and short rib. Each the size of 1 skewer. I honestly might have been mad about it if I wasn't so full off of the salatim by the time we got it and I didn't have dessert in the back of my mind for the near future. My angst quickly faded though after tasting the meats. They were cooked perfectly and super succulent, very satisfying. We ended our meal with a cool and creamy treat- a brown sugar soft serve that came with a tahini hard shell on top that was fabulous. Reminiscent of a peanut butter dip I would get as a child. A great date spot to go to especially if you're trying to impress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/laser-wolf-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was understandably pretty tough to get a reservation, so we had to settle for a Sunday night, but worth it. The space itself is huge and airy, with unbeatable views of the NYC skyline. It was a bit chilly the evening we went, but I imagine sitting outside in the summer would be incredible. Our servers were great, super attentive and explained how their menu worked. Menu is pre-fixe, each diner gets a protein that is grilled with unlimited dips and sides. We were with a large group so we had an array of proteins, and all were grilled to perfection. I personally had the chicken and loved it. I don't usually like baba ganoush, but this one was delicious, and the hummus was one of my favorites. They top off the dinner with a brown sugar ice cream for everyone, which was such a treat and just enough after a big meal.
