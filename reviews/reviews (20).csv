While the restaurant was a little loud, the dining area was far enough removed from the bar that it didn't feel overly full. The service was prompt and the whole staff was inviting. I got the Cadillac burger cooked medium. While the burger was good, it was pretty clear that the bun was not up to the task. The bottom portion basically disintegrated because of the juice of the medium cooked patty. A more robust bun, or at the very least toasting the bun, was needed in order to take the burger from good to great.

The frozen rose, while refreshing on a hot day, is way too overpriced at nearly $20 a piece. Don't get the crunchy chicken sandwich, it's a very dry chicken sandwich without condiments, except lettuce, on the burger. The Clarke burger was probably the only thing somewhat worth it's value (because it tasted like an okay cheeseburger). Not even gonna get into the starter. Overall, the value of the dinner pictured here was ~$120. I do not recommend going here. There are so many places in NYC you could go to and get a decent meal for that same value. The service is also exceptional poor. Essentially, you have to find a waiter or order at the bar.

The view is magnificent, the bar was decent. Table service was beyond pandemic S-L-O-W. The food for our party of ten took 1hour and 20 minutes and when it finally got to our table all of the dishes except one were ice COLD, the Brussels sprouts, blistered green beans, burgers, fries all we cold. Clearly the food sat for a long time, inexcusable for an establishment that boasts such quality. This has to be my first negative review, normally I would overlook small issues, but a party of 10 in downtown Manhattan should not be subjected to this level of service. You must do better. After speaking with a manager, we received no satisfaction. Fortunately, Endy Sanchez, another manager, was brought to our table by our server.

Asked for a diet coke, was given a regular coke which I drank a partial amount before realizing it could not possibly be a diet coke.  Looked at the bottle and sure enough, it was a regular coke.  I thought I was going to have a diabetic shock, since I have insulin resistance.  Spoke with someone claiming to be a manager who seemed to want to somehow resolve this.  However, apparently he was insincere, because he said he'd call me, but I never heard back from him.  In addition to the coke debacle, the server forgot the avocado and onion rings I had ordered, and finally brought them over, when i was almost finished.  Also I received a salad with croutons after I clearly ordered it WITHOUT croutons.   I felt like I was in a bad sitcom.  Word of advice, servers need to listen to and respect what the patron orders, because given the wrong food or beverage, could have some very serious consequences for the patron. With so many people having food allergies, or medical issues, this restaurant, and any restaurant for that matter, cannot afford to be careless and negligent with what people order to eat, and then be cavalier about it, because it's no laughing matter.  The so-called manager had an opportunity to step up, and should have made some sort of effort to satisfactorily resolve this, rather than disappear and be totally useless, and ineffectual. I've read many comments and critiques here on yelp, where only some get a weak reply from the owner, who only goes as far as to refer the comment to his marketing team for them to investigate, resulting in more weak replies that don't take the customer's part. This is offensive and insulting.  When eating at this over priced over rated, over hyped up joint, people need to make sure they got what they ordered, even if it means being a nuisance.  It's your health and well being that's at stake, not the server's, not the manager's, or owners health.

The Bar was slammed with office workers & they only had 1 bartender solo on the first long bar. Usually that would mean slow wait times if its busy and understaffed but we saw how fast the bartender was working & customers walking away with drinks. We sat at the bar and were greeted by the host & bartender immediately. The food came out fast! And the Bartender Ray as busy as he was was banging out and taking care of his section, everyone had a drink & he was always attentive. We had a great dinner & i recommend the Aperol Cocktail with Blood Orange- has a slight hint of the Paloma to Margarita Taste which makes it so unique as compared to a regular Aperol Spritz. I love to see bartenders actually measure when putting together a speciality cocktail as it keeps the balance & flavor consistent - and Its always great to see a Bartender keep that consistency even when they are busy.

Used to go to the UES location for burgers so we thought the Brookfield location would be nice on a sunny day. Everything was either cold, tasteless or late. All the fries arrived cold --like bagged potato chips cold. Lobsters on the salad and the seafood platter were inedible -- tasted stale and bland. The dressing on the Caesar Salad was like watered down yogurt -- no taste or flavor. Any deli would make a better salad with a store bought dressing. We mostly had salads and lobster rolls but the two hot dishes we ordered came cold as well. One of our friends asked for a bunless burger due to allergies and that arrived after we all finished our food -- 45 min late.

I'm not exaggerating, I am a Pastry Chef and I attended Johnson & Wales, I rarely write a bad review, but this food was inedible. My husband called to complain, he was hung up on twice, after the third phone call to the restaurant he spoke to the manager who said they would resend our meal, only for them to deliver another hamburger that had a stale bread bun, so stale it was completely hard. The pudding again was a liquid mess. My husband then called back and spoke to a rude hostess and then to the manager again, he had to argue for a refund. He was just short of taking food back to restaurant and confronting the manager. We would never order food from here again.

We opted for indoor seating because of the high humidity. Was seated rather quickly and the wait staff was very friendly and quite attentive. The 2 stars were for the food. Started off with the buffalo wings which were nothing to rave about but how can you go wrong with that. Ceviche was good and flavorful, but the fried calarmari was rubbery, tasteless and just not good. Now for the entrees, one daughter ordered the buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich with garlic fries. The chicken was dried and lukewarm and tasteless and the garlic fries were soggy and cold.  My husband and daughter's boyfriend had the cadillac burger with sweet potato fries. I ordered the regular burger with sweet potato fries and all the burgers came out lukewarm and all the fries were lukewarm as well. I complained about the fries and the waiter happily took it back into the kitchen and bought out fries that were hot but looked like it was refried til it looked burnt. The garlic fries came back still soggy and more oilly looking.  We were so hungry because of the long wait for our food to arrive that my husband and daughter's boyfriend did not bother complaining about their burgers. My other daughter ordered the fish and chips and her food was the only thing that was decent including the regular fries which were hot and crunchy unlike  ours. Decided to skip dessert since practically everything we had was not good and did not want to waste time or money.

Don't get me wrong they're not bad burgers but I'd rather get the same burger somewhere else for less money. Their frose is tasty but no where near worth the $20 especially when the waitress takes it off the table before you finish (like wtf?). The waiters are particular sneaky about adding the extra condiments to your meals that make your check add up. I wanted a classic burger and she tried throwing in all these extra condiments knowing what I ordered was specific. They're not worried about service but more about how big the check ends up being. Also odd side note: a waiter was picking coins out of the coin fountain where we were sitting.

The first time I came was after visiting Brookfield Place, I got a table outside. My friend wanted to order something off the Specials menu but they were sold out. He then proceeded to order another dish and it was sold out again...SERIOUSLY?! I ordered the Japanese style lobster roll, but when my order came it was another lobster roll. I hate to complain (bc I don't want any spit in my food) and just ate the bland lobster roll. It was not good at all. My friend got some duck & pasta dish, he said it was alright. I came here again on July 4th, and decided to only get drinks. I asked the bartender for the cocktail menu & he handed it to me and added that the Sangria was the drink special of the day & he highly recommends it. Nothing on the menu really stood out so we went with the sangria...big mistake! It tasted awful! It didn't even taste like sangria & 2 glasses set us back $38 after tip. We asked the bartender if we could take the drinks to the seated area and he said yes, we just cannot go outside the restaurant property with the drinks. The seated area was rather empty so we walked to one of the empty tables (one out of 30 that were empty) and attempted to sit down. A Hispanic busboy runs over like we committed a crime & told us we MUST checkin with the hostess. We asked if he could just tell her and he said NO! We walk over to the hostess and ask if we could just sit down and finish our drinks and she said I needed to put my name on the wait list if I wanted to sit outside.

Service was non-existent!!  It took 15-20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, 5-10 additional minutes to get the menu we were promised and 15-20 more minutes to get our drinks, which is pretty ridiculous (where's Jon Taffer)!! I considered leaving but my girlfriend talked me into staying.  Once someone did attend to us, we received food and drinks seamlessly, thank you Lady!! My girlfriend and I arrived for lunch and ordered the beet/goat cheese salad app (which was really good), the crab cake dinner, so we could have one crab cake a piece and they were delicious, the tuna tacos were good but they were teeny tiny (bit size, a little bigger than a thumb tack, not much) and you only get 4 of them and they are laid on a couple of creative lime wedges for $18!! We ordered their onion rings and they came to us soggy and greasy. Lady apologized and put in another order for us, this time the manager brought it over and not only were they extra soggy and greasy, this time they were on the darker side.  I wondered if they put our previous order back in the fryer and tried to pass it as crispy because they were darker in color.  Manager apologized and said they were very busy and the fryer may not be hot enough (of course it wasn't).  We decided to order something else, which was the mini burger sampler and that was really good.  Drinks and food are really overpriced so get ready to put a BIG dent in your wallet/purse.  I would only visit again because the view is too hard to pass up on, but even then, maybe we will sit in the public area and bring our own lunch next time!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/p-j-clarkes-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jen B.,/user_details?userid=lRoaOeSWI1Jk4vs7euEZTg,"New York, NY",8/22/2018,2.0,"This was a very average restaurant experience. I sat outside by the water which was nice. My boyfriend got the shrimp cocktail, which we expected to come with more than 5 shrimps for the price, but the taste was good. I got the fluke ceviche which was really refreshing and flavorful, but it didn't come with bread or crackers, which I thought was weird. I ultimately asked for some bread to eat with it. For the main course, I ate the swordfish which was full of nice greek flavor. However, my boyfriend ordered the brick pressed chicken which was horrible. The chicken was not ""pressed"" at all, it was barely crispy and the skin was light. The potatoes were crunchy raw. When we brought this up to our server he was very apologetic and gave us a complimentary dessert, but never even brought out cooked potatoes. We also ordered a side of crispy brussels sprouts.. they were not crispy at all. They were actually too hard to eat. We heard another table send them back twice to get crunchier and even still they were not crunchy. We also got comped the sprouts because they came out 15 mins after the food. For dessert we ordered the chocolate mousse cake which was just fine, the best part was the espresso whipped cream on top and the ganache covering the cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/p-j-clarkes-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Emilio S.,/user_details?userid=yB0KkuYUy2V58BA4pCKF3Q,"Manhattan, NY",7/8/2018,5.0,"Crazy that anyone wouldn't enjoy this place. PJ Clarke's as a whole is a fantastic restaurant with wonderful American flare, and is a true New York staple. The Vesey location however is phenomenal; with a clear view of the Statue of Liberty and overlooking the yacht filled Hudson River. Everything from the burgers, steaks, lobster rolls, oysters, and everything else is delicious and well presented. That mixed in with the ambiance makes it for more than just a dining experience. The service we had was spectacular.. Kristen was so attentive and personable and really added to our night. There was no rush to just turn over the table for the next guests as we got to enjoy a beautiful sunset while taking our time with all the great food and drinks we ordered with a monstrous chocolate cake and ice cream to top off a great night of food and family. We come here every year with friends and family from out of town mainly in the summer. We live in midtown, and was shopping uptown and decided to jump in a cab and head down there vs just going to one of the many great spots in our neighborhood because of how great of an overall experience it is, especially when the weather is so good. If you don't have a reservation, you will have to wait 40 minutes to an hour for a table outside, but totally worth the wait, plus it's a great scene in that revamped area now with the shopping centers and views.

It was really cold and windy yet the staff kept coming in and out of the door right by where we were sitting. Each time it was so windy I would pick my napkin up off the floor. Staff saw but kept coming in and out the door. Food was ok but prices expensive for a burger without fries. My Guinness tasted flat. Our plates did not get picked up in a timely manor because the staff was busy taking manual inventory of the alcohol. This is 2016 and there is automation.

The interior itself is very cozy. As I was being seated ,I asked for a tall table by the window and the host pointed me to one. As my friend and I sat there we realized that the area by our table was quickly becoming a stroller parking lot. We were surrounded by everyone's stoller and things quickly went downhill from there. The host should have warned us that where we sat is a spot for strollers and people chatting-and not a good place to sit or at least asked us if we wanted to move when he saw the situation. He surely had enough time to chat and laugh with his co-workers but no time to pay attention to guests. Now the waitress, no smile ,not welcoming. Took our order and went missing the entire time. I couldn't get another drink and had to wait forever for the check. Now the food- the burger was okay, average. The french fries were average as well, the onion rings were extremely oily. When you pay $22 dollars for some burger and fries ,you expect a bit of a better service and food.

The brussel sprouts came out and werent shaved, but cut in half extremely greasy and undercooked. The prosecco came and it was so flat we thought they brought us wine by accident.

I had family in town this past weekend and we went to the location downtown near Brookfield place. We all ordered water, and one Diet Coke, burgers (which I think are the cheapest on the menu) and split fries, and our waitress looked very unhappy about how small our bill was going to be. Granted I understand that a place like this you expect to make big tips, but regardless as a waitress you should treat every customer the same and still work for those tips. I think she thought we were all tourists and decided to never check on our table unless we flagged her down to get something. Maybe she thought she had nothing to lose by not serving us, but what she didn't know is that I live here and have told every person about this experience. Read on it only gets worse. 40 mins later we still didn't get our food, so I asked her and she said she would ""check"", we noticed that other tables that got there after us had been getting their food already so that had us concerned (mind you they were NOT busy this night). She finally returned and said, ""there was a disaster in the kitchen, so sorry guys."" So we gave her a few more mins then ANOTHER table next to us got their food and had gotten there at least 20 mins after us. We had been contemplating just getting up and leaving if we didn't get our food but once that happened we decided F it this is ridiculous! We thought about leaving money for the DC but decided that it was utterly ridiculous to be treated the way we were. She saw us get up and said, ""sorry guys"" with a stupid little smirk on her face like she got her way. I'm still appalled at this experience.

Alex K.,/user_details?userid=Ehdpl5l6TMe0cKtBJzcL3Q,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",9/3/2022,5.0,- This place is right around the corner from my Air Bnb and it is always packed! This southern restaurant has indoor and out door seating and is very quick to get food out to you. The chicken is stupid good. I tried the chicken sandwich and the spicy level was perfect and the chicken was incredibly juicy. I would not go here if you aren't very hungry because the portions are big and you need to be rolled out if you finish your plate. The margarita is also delish.

Madalena G.,/user_details?userid=EJ_gdZtiUaNTQa9WzqgeVg,"Brooklyn, NY",6/8/2022,3.0,This review was long overdue. I came a few months ago and just forgot to leave a review. So I came here thinking I was coming to Peaches...what a big mistake. It's a fairly small space and they have a whiteboard that they ask you to add your name to since the entrance isn't large enough for a group of people to wait to be seated. The waitress was nice but the food was ok. The shrimp and catfish that we ordered spicy came out with basically seasoning dumped on top. While I enjoy my food being seasoned it was clear that it was not marinated or cooked together it was just dumped on top after it was done being cooked. We both ended up with stomachaches. My suggestion go to Peaches lol NOT  Peaches Hothouse...,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peaches-hothouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's a beautiful sunny Sunday so I went for lunch with my girlfriends. The only complaint I have is the fact that they don't have any signage to identify the establishment. The wait time for a table was about 40 minutes but it went fast. The restaurant is small and cozy. We eventually were seated at the bar, which was fine. It was just 3 of us. The bartender and wait staff were friendly and accommodating. This place is known for their chicken sandwich so my friend ordered it. We also ordered the jumbo shrimp sandwich and the catfish sandwich with a side of the collard greens. These sandwiches come in a spicy version but we all choose the regular option. The drink of choice was the Brownstone Punch. The sandwiches are on the big side and comes with your choice of regular or sweet potato fries.  Everything was delicious and that rum punch was it!!

We also ordered mac and cheese and collard greens as sides and fried green tomatoes as our appetizer. This was actually my first time ever having fried green tomatoes and it was really tasty. Pairing it with the pickled onions and aioli was perfect. When it came to the entree, I wish I had ordered the fried chicken with spicy seasoning. I had some of the spicy fried fish and it was like a punch to the mouth! Full of flavor and heat, but not too overwhelming. Don't get me wrong, without the spice the fried chicken was still crispy, moist, and delicious. The mac and cheese though?? SO good! Perfect mix of creamy and cheesy. I wish the sides were bigger!

I did not say that I wanted dark meat, which I prefer, and so they proceeded to give me mostly white meat. Cornbread was also dry and crumbled to the touch.

Amaka D.,/user_details?userid=APtcnlC_vulvHXn1kE9uZA,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1/2/2022,5.0,We came here for my sisters birthday. This was a summer ending night so the weather was good. We reached and was shocked that it wasn't  a dine in spot. It's actually a grab and go with some seats and tables surrounding it. If you plan on coming here for your birthday it's way to casual. We decided to just grab a table outside and eat. The area isn't somewhere I'd sit again honestly. A lot of panhandling. Kind of scary. But overall the food was great. Chicken fried fresh and spicy. I'll come back but just legit grab and go.

I love Peaches and if I could I would be here everyday but would probably need to run a triathlon every other day! Everything I've had has always been nothing but delicious. Their take on shrimp n grits is nothing I've seen before. They have these unbelievably sinful fried squares filled with grits and barbecue shrimp and I just can't get enough of this dish!

Not to mention, the service is superb. On this specific visit, we ordered the fried shrimp & fried (hot &spicy) catfish with the sides: mac & cheese, spicy broccoli and collar greens. Every bite was mouth watering enough you couldn't wait for the next one. The spice on the catfish was just enough to flavor the underneath well seasoned fish. It paired well. The mac & cheese is just your favorite southern side dish as it should be, CHEESE IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES! The collard greens were smoked to perfection, tasting the meat with every bite and the broccoli was not your average.

I got a lot of gristle bits and not very much chicken. Worst chicken sandwich I've ever had. I should have gotten a hot chicken sandwich from pop eyes or chic-fil-a instead.

The chicken was fried very well with a crispy outside and a warm and soft inside. The side of mac and cheese was one of the better ones I've had. My favorite side however was the spicy grilled broccoli. Extremely flavorful and went very well with a big sandwich and creamy mac and cheese. Waitress was very attentive and friendly.

Kellie M.,/user_details?userid=_jhFuDbBGLvF43N41nsbwg,"Brooklyn, NY",1/27/2021,3.0,"Very disappointing. I ordered delivery for my birthday dinner (was feeling too sick to go out) & was truly excited for the quality southern food I was expecting. But the food was greasy, portions were relatively small, and the food wasn't even warm! I had to re-heat the food in the oven when it got here, which seems counterproductive to ordering take-out in the first place. Even the fries were flavorless, soggy, and lackadaisically thrown into a paper bag. I don't know if peaches was having an off take-out day, cuz I saw people post better food on ig who were at the restaurant. But I wouldn't have paid so much for a meal (total was $47.65 including $4.55 service fee and $5 dasher tip) or chosen it for my birthday. The order arrived really quickly (like 25-30 minutes from placing order) and the food tasted good once I reheated it and seasoned the fries. I like their hot spices and Mac and cheese, but would never order delivery from them again.

The Fried Green Tomatoes are a symphony in your mouth. The tomatoes are lightly fried to perfection. It comes with Krispy Bacon, arugula salad with hint of pickled red onions. The salad dressing is delightful. I appreciate that it comes on the side. And the remoulade for the tomatoes has a slight welcomed kick. Just typing this, I think I will go for a walk this afternoon and get some to go. Be patient good food takes time and you can taste the care. It is worth the wait.

The hot fried chicken was crunchy on the outside and filled with flavor in the inside. I also enjoyed my side of macaroni and cheese. Guys beware, the hot chicken is VERY hot, and I love spicy food.

All the sides I've tried are amazing, but I always return to the mac and cheese: They make it with cavatappi, a rare but perfect shape for mac and cheese, and it's never mushy or bland.

Luckily I came across this gem. Upon arriving, I was greeted immediately. And not one of the types of greetings that are generic, but rather a warm, polite and gracious greeting. I ordered the fried chicken meal (2 of them) and a side of Mac n Cheese. The spice levels range from regular, to hot and extra hot.  Of course i ordered the regular to be safe lol. My order came within 15 minutes and I was off and running to my home. Immediately,  i opened the box. It contained 3 pieces of chicken. Not sure if it's always 3 pieces or because of how I ordered (I asked for 2 pieces of chicken breast).  Irregardless,  i noticed a few things, 1st the pieces are not large in size BUT they are meaty and flavorful. 2, They have a smal kick. The batter is light and tasty. It doesnt overwhelm the chicken. The chicken it self was very very juicy. The mac and cheese was very good. And 3, the Corn Bread, lets just say I wish i ordered several more pieces because they tasted that good. I definitely recommend this place. The staff are very nice and accommodating. The food is delectable. I would give it 5 stars, but, there is always room for improvement, like..... a larger piece of cornbread lol.

Miya O.,/user_details?userid=_TZ-mAfi8WQjUm4XPafLbQ,"East New York, NY",3/24/2021,3.0,"Peaches Hothouse on Tompkins was a go-to for me when it served loaded baked grits and peaches french toast. During covid, that location removed those items from the menu and informed me that I would have to visit the nearby, larger Bed Stuy location for those things, which I did. The other location is not as good and takes muchhhh longer to complete take-out orders (no less than 30 minutes). The other location also doesn't make the loaded baked grits, and the grits they do make taste really bad (I gave them 3 shots to get it right). Now, if you're interested in chicken, mac and cheese and other common soul food dishes, HotHouse is still the place to go and the other location seems ok for those items. This review is more a rant about the removal of the french toast and loaded baked grits.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peaches-hothouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friend choose this location and my experience was even more forgettable here. Came here on a Thursday afternoon this location is even smaller we decided on sitting at the bar and the dry bartender girl gave us the menu. I ordered the boneless chicken and French toast. The chicken while very crispy was like boneless thigh meat so I didn't really care for it being that I am a breast girl. The French toast was big and fluffy on what I believe was challah bread which was good too. The drinks were weak as hell I had some kind of bourbon lemonade and it tasted like neither of those things. There was no service from the bartender and to me if you are in the service industry you should at least have a personality.

But my chicken was a disgrace to the nashville style, not wet with sauce, not hot, and not that great as just fried chicken.

My wife had the fried chicken with collard greens; we also tried the fried green tomatoes with bacon and arugula, it all tasted great. The portions were more than enough.

Despite it being less than 10 degrees Fahrenheit, the restaurant had little to no heat running forcing us to sit at the table in our winter jacket and gloves to wait for our food. There was also only one server working (on a Saturday night), so it took a full 10 minutes to even get a menu. Everything about the temperature and service was unacceptable. If your heat is malfunctioning, you should close he restaurant until it's fixed. Additionally, it looks like they changed the tomato on the hot chicken sandwich from a cooked tomato to a raw tomato. Total downgrade. Overall, it just seems like the owners don't care as much about Hothouse anymore. It was so poorly run. Really a bummer, because it was one of my favorite spots a few years ago.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peaches-hothouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Cathlene G.,/user_details?userid=KMTe5n5sFE1T2hxP7QCBTQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9/2/2021,2.0,"So I came into peaches this past Sunday for a quick order of two fries. We waited about 20 minutes but that was all good I know they have high customer traffic on the weekends. When they eventually called us in for our fries the bartender, a man with glasses gave us our total which was $10.89. I then tried to pay with Apple pay only to realize I had to pay with card so my sister who was with me offered to pay as I didn't bring my card with me. Her card does not have a chip on it and the bartender gave us the card back asking ""where's the chip?"" Once again I just brushed it off and we both looked for cash to pay with. Luckily my sister had 11 dollars in cash which she gave to him I was about to turn around and leave until my sister reminded me that we have to wait for the change. We waited about 2 minutes until I realized the bartender had gone back to what he was doing and was talking with other servers. I spoke up and asked him about the change and he said he didn't have any change for us. I was shocked that instead of telling us he was going to let us stand there waiting for the change he went about his business and we had to ask him for it. We ended up leaving and to some while 11¢ may seem trivial it's more the fact that he thought it was ok for us to stand there waiting for the change instead of telling us the situation.

They cook it in onions, peppers and tomato sauce. Definitely not skipping out on flavor there. I also love the short rib sandwich. It's beef which is always a plus and it's a nice size.

It had a slight spoiled taste to it given the muddled strawberries might have not been fresh. The catfish was good. The loaded grits were not good we barely ate them the sour cream tasted off. The granola French toast was good but they gave no syrup we had to ask the folks sitting next to us.

I'm definitely ordering this!!! So why 2 stars you may ask. Well for starters I thought the place only paid half their light bill because it was so damn dark. It was not even a sexy kinda dark. It was that dark when half the lights are out. That dull dark because the back lights are only on! I spoke with the manager about it and she says ""oh we did some renovations and it's just more open"". What the hell does that have to do with the damn lights?! If you didn't know any better you would think the place was closed. Well being the person I am I gave her the suggestion of tea lights on the tables and bar. This will add some light life to the space. She thought it was a great idea. Now on to the food..  I ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes. The bacon salad on top was everything - they could have left the FGT in the kitchen. Tomatoes were cut way to thick and lacked seasoning.  The fried catfish was ok. The crust looked as though it was was nice and deep fried, but it was soft.   Uhhhhhhh! The mac and cheese lacked favor and CHEESE! I guess since it was Tuesday they didn't get the cheese dlvy.   The cornbread ... I already said enough negativity. Let's just say it looked like cornbread.  Will I come back  for another meal .... Uhhhhhhhhh ... that will be a NO Alex! I will give the waitress 4 stars. She was really nice.  She was so kind when she took back my 4C powdered ice tea/lemonade mixture.

Nothing to holler and make you do backflips over. You can always tell if a restaurant is good is the can cook the basics well.

I was actually confusing it with the other peaches on Lewis Ave (which I'm not too fond of) until a friend made it clear that they are not the same establishment. So I went there on a Saturday night around 9....big mistake! Wait time.....45 minutes but I was going to wait. This was my one chance and I was going to take it lol. It's a cramped environment. Tables and people hovering over each other; there's a small waiting area right in front of the door which is separated by a heavy black curtain to keep the cold off of the dining room floor. We stood in the doorway and about 50 minutes later we were seated #overit we were finally seated and were placed closer to the door (so cold) but when I asked to change to another table they didn't hesitate to accommodate. We finally ordered. For starters....the loaded grits and the main dishes: I went with the fried chicken with Mac and cheese and my friend ordered the shrimp with grilled broccoli and another side of kale. Let me tell you both dishes were amazing. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the grits and the kale but everything else....A1.

I finally received my Southern Chicken Sandwich with fries and side of mac and cheese. It looked soooo good. The reason why I gave it 3 stars was because I found 2 medium sized bones in my sandwich; it was also dark meat. I went to ahead to take out the bones and eat around the small fatty pieces. I thought this was how they made their sandwiches and I should have asked more about the sandwich prior. So once we were done eating and were asked how the meal was, that's when I find out there wasn't supposed to be bone in it. And that a mistake was actually made. I was just told, if I said something I could have got a new one.  And he was like we're not trying to kill you, lol. It would have been nice if they discounted my meal after that.

Adrianna T.,/user_details?userid=YYflbmPa3i1JGUYUQ4QsDQ,"Union City, NJ",10/14/2018,2.0,"After hearing so many good things about Peaches HotHouse I decided to give it a try. There was a long line, but that doesn't bother me when I am expecting to try some bomb southern food. The food is just mediocre. I tried the extra hot chicken and it wasn't extremely hot at all. I was disappointed when my mouth wasn't feeling the burn. I expected a spicy chicken when they give you a warning about how spicy it. So if your looking forward to trying a spicy chicken, you will be disappointed when it's not at that level. I also ordered the spicy shrimp which was better, not overcooked.  The mashed potato was dry and no flavor. I'm confused why so many great reviews. Maybe it was my batch of chicken! Good luck if you try this restaurant. I would say keep searching ~ Cheers!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peaches-hothouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's the type of place where you take a bite of their food and you just shake your head, speechless, because it's just that good. I get the extra spicy hothouse chicken - I'd like to think that I handle my spicy pretty well and this one has a strong kick, but just enough to get your blood pumping. The chicken is tender, moist, and cooked to perfection. The skin is thin, crispy, and covered in that magical concoction of spices. Use the bbq sauce on the table - it's absolutely delicious and great for coating pieces of chicken for a cool down. The restaurant is packed at all hours, but well worth the wait.

As other people have said, yes there is usually a wait, as should be expected when going to a weekend brunch to a restaurant that is small  and local. I don't get how people are perturbed by that. They have a system where you write your name on a whiteboard in front so you can even see how many folks are ahead of you. My girlfriend and I have never had to wait more than 10-15 minutes. The drinks are clever and delicious and the food has always been great. I love the spicy chicken sandwich and the corn pancakes. The vibe is great here as well, they have dope music playing every time I come. It does take a while for the food but it's a small one room restaurant, the kitchen can't be but so big with so many people working. Be understandable and hungry, and come to leisure.

Kaitlin W.,/user_details?userid=Z7cb2naFGP8YZRcjWzkKJg,"Atlanta, GA",1/7/2018,2.0,"My friend and I decided to check this place out after I had walked by one day and seen that it was pretty packed. I assumed the food would be fantastic, but I was wrong. We went in and ordered the BBQ shrimp and the fried green tomatoes as appetizers. They were both OK, but nothing too special. We went on to order our chicken and I decided to get the hot chicken and he got the Nashville hot chicken.... holy s*** was his chicken hot... I love spicy food but it can't JUST be spicy, there should be flavor as well, right? His chicken was so hot that it made my lips go numb and there was absolutely no flavor other than HOT. He had the cole slaw which I  practically finished in seconds just trying to make the hot go away. It helped but it would have been better if their coleslaw didn't taste like water. Now my chicken on the other hand was just hot chicken which was totally bearable but pretty disgusting. The chicken still had no flavor at all... the chicken skin had zero flavor as well.. just a little dash of some hot spice. I also had the macaroni and mashed potatoes which were pretty good surprisingly. The corn bread was super dry though. I had pretty much gulped my whole drink in a second after eating my friends chicken and once I  started eating the cornbread I  felt like I was going to choke.. you're definitely going to want to have a drink nearby when eating bread drier than Popeyes biscuits. Overall the experience was pretty crappy and the food was below average.

The bun was good. Idk it might've been brioche or something but it was tasty. My only knock on this spot is the compactness of the location.

Jesi Z.,/user_details?userid=OXaOBrhgq3xkCgepgDJIAQ,"Brooklyn, NY",8/17/2018,1.0,"I am posting this review late (6 months), but a friend of mine reminded me that it needs to be posted. Peaches Hot House serves good food, but they have unprofessional management. My husband and I went to Peaches Hot house for Valentine's Day 2018. At the end of the meal, we gave our server two $25 gift cards ($50 total) that we received from our friends as a Christmas gift. The server came back to us and explained that, ""Peaches card system was down and the manager was not present."" I told the waitress to take our gift cards and contact me if there were any issues. Instead, she told me to put the meal on my personal credit card. I told her that it is not my fault that their card system is down and therefore not my responsibility to cover a meal that had previously been paid for via gift cards. Additionally, I was surprised there was no one present that was responsible enough to deal with the situation. She told me I had no other choice and I put the cost on my card (a mistake, I should have just left) and even tipped 19%. I wrote down the waitresses name and told her I would be coming back to get a refund. I came back a few days later and gave the manager my gift cards and the manager said I should expect a refund. I never received that refund and have been having to go back and forth to this restaurant to resolve the issue. By the end of my experience I had not only paid for a meal that I should not have ($60), but also lost my gift cards ($50), so in total I paid $110 for a $60 meal... I was never reimbursed on my credit card. Would be glad to show management. I feel like I've been robbed from this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peaches-hothouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I got there around 1:30PM on 7/20. Upon entering the space, the bartender was busy swiping credit cards and the server/busser/runner was doing maybe half of one of those jobs. I surveyed the space and was surprisingly greeted by one of the chefs. HE cleared a table for me, brought me a menu, took my order, got me my drinks, cooked my food AND ran it to my table. While this all happened, none of the front of house staff thought to figure out what was happening w my table (of 1). It wasn't until I put my headphones in to deafen the conversation being had at the bar between the bartender and his friends about his opinion of ""fat"" and ""thick"" women and what they should call themselves. (Very appropriate conversation to have while serving fried chicken, ok). All the while another woman was maybe a server or food runner was standing around, drinking her beverage and shouting with the bartenders guests about ""white v black music""... the topic is irrelevant, reflective of what she seemingly thought of her job. She walked past my table multiple times, never went to ask if I would like a box for the remaining of my food that I no longer had an appetite to enjoy. At some point, you might assume someone having lunch by themselves would like to pay and leave, but these people must not want or need money. As someone who has worked in the industry for years, I would advise that if these people would like to make money in any capacity, they fix this lackadaisical and ""too cool for school"" attitude. Perhaps think beyond their offensive conversations, and reappropriate that energy towards the other ten tables filled with paying customers.

The spicy chicken sandwich was the same except it had an excessive amount of paprika on it. Not a nice blend of spices, or sauce, just straight up paprika. Excessively spicy and not flavorful at all. The fries were cold, week old McDonald's fries. Not even kidding, they served us old McDonald's fries. Mac and cheese was ok, but cold and burnt.

I mess around and do so many other things and now it's getting LATE! Finally I make it to Brooklyn, chicken & Waffles are on my mind, since I'm not going to be to far, I figure I'll try Sweet Brooklyn bar and grill. Find parking around the corner, walk down the block and enter. There's A party going on. Ladies are singing, dancing and drinking to loud hip hop music the dj's playing. I wait to see if there's A hostess and will they approach me. After waiting about 10mins and nothing has happened, I notice the lady on the far side taking drink orders. I asked her can I sit somewhere and eat. She informed me the kitchen is closed, it's past 4PM. With that said, I leave and head towards another spot near by, I've read about. I arrive and I almost actually passed right by. If it wasn't for the people standing in front, I very well would've walked right by. I enter and it's Very tiny. Simple decor, nothing fancy, the bar occupies the majority of the room. I'm told to place my name on the board, brunch is over and @430 PM Dinner is beginning.  When my name is called, I'm offered A seat at said bar, I'm in A hurry, so I accept to sit there. Ordered the Fried chicken and mac and cheese as my side. The chicken was well cooked and tasted good. The mac and cheese was OK, cornbread which came with the meal, was very good. If you've read previous post of mines, you should know I like my food piping hot, this was not the case, the food wasn't cold, but it could've been slightly hotter. Overall I like the simplistic vibes and decor, you can tell, they are Basically about serving F00D and not worried about all the other ancillary stuff. I will like to come back and try brunch.

The chicken was double fried so it was very crunchy and the meat was moist and juicy. Loved the sprouts although I would've added garlic and fried it in bacon grease (just saying). It came with corn cake (it was corn bread but it was sweeter than Jiffy cornbread and I'm not a fan of sweet bread).

I happened to stumble upon Peaches Hot House and figured we should give it a try and let me just say that I am soooo glad that we did. We waited about an hr (as this place does not take reservations which is a bit annoying) but it was DEFINITELY worth the wait. We both had the sweet tea which was not to sweet and not to tart. She ordered the hot fried shrimp (which could be ordered as regular, hot or extra hot) and grits. We asked our waiter on a scale of 1-10 how hot the hot was and he said between a 6-7 which was NOT the case. Let me preface this by stating that my girlfriend is Trinidadian (born and raised) and is very well accustomed with hot/spicy food and this  was beyond hot; so if you do not like hot food like myself I strongly suggest that you get the regular. She did however finish her entire plate as the food was AMAZING but did mention a plethora of times that her mouth and lips were on fire. I ordered the Jim Cade brunch which included boneless fried chicken breast, granola crusted French toast, grits and eggs (which ii substituted for collard greens as I do not eat eggs). My order was delicious to say the least.

I would suggest not using plastic containers for salad dressing when people are dining in. Our server the first time was inattentive. We had to search out other servers to address our needs.

Amber G.,/user_details?userid=DwxLb2xm4W2-yl1NcERIcw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",3/7/2019,2.0,Food presentation was wonderful however it was bland and unseasoned. Grits weren't cooked thoroughly and the cheese used in them reminded of traditional Mac n cheese (not velveeta). The French toast was doughy! Frustrating to chew! And the turkey bacon was tough as all get out! The highlight though was the shrimp ! The shrimp was AMAZING !!!!! So maybe if we ever go back just get the shrimp and grits!

I be been here countless times and at one point was going 2 times a week(I live borderline Long Island ). I'm gonna tell you right now I have no cons for this place whatsoever. This restaurant has a rustic feel  in a nice , cozy , intimate setting. There is always good music rotating on the sound system, great southern comfort food flying out the kitchen, and awesome flavorful drinks to wash it all down with. Im a big fan of the shrimp with creamy grits!! JESUS!!!!!!!!!!! I always get a side of chicken too. It's heaven on a plate. My drinks of choice are normally the sister Rosetta and the lighting Hopkins . I'm just a slave to this place!!. They are known for their ""hot "" specialty spice. The cuisine is Tennessee inspired dishes. I've converted my mom and brother. All staff are nice and great for conversations if you are sitting at the bar.

Consequently, if you like your chicken with some extra heat, going for the hot or even extra hot should satiate your palette. You also can't go wrong with any of the sides.

Make sure you go to the right one cause the other Peaches doesn't have fried chicken (though it does have a variety of more upscale food, which is also very good...just not the chicken). Go try the spiciest chicken and the arugula salad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peaches-hothouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Dayanna D.,/user_details?userid=gQZc06T-KPR4gDMmYLSSew,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",3/10/2018,1.0,"I can here with some coworkers a couple of weeks ago and the service stared off great. We were a large group and the waitress was extremely attentive. However, once people began to leave, a couple of us (3 in total) stayed behind to continue drinking and eating. The restaurant itself was EMPTY (which is saying a lot because the place is already small). Anyway while we sat chit chatting, our original waitress came over and proceeded to separate our tables as if we weren't sitting right there in the middle of a conversation. No excuse me or this is what I'm doing. Side eye and how rude! We of course put the tables back because we were still drinking and planning to order more food. Then another waiter came and attempted to separate us again telling us to sit at the bar. After going back and forth with him, I'm assuming the manager came over. She then justified us not sitting at the tables, and told us to move to the bar because they needed to prepare the tables for the dinner customers. So I'll say this again... the restaurant was EMPTY! If any dinner customers were coming in there were plenty of available tables for them to sit at. Plus we were still ordering food and drinks! All I saw was an incompetent manager mistreat existing customers all on the premise that other people ""may"" come. It was a disgusting display of management, poor etiquette, failure to acknowledge existing customers, and full on incompetence. I would never return nor would I recommend this place to anyone else.

The food was underwhelming. The wait made it so we were unable to eat in so we took our food to go. The hour wait was just a little too much. I didn't mind the wait but I was hungry. It was a 27min drive from the restaurant to my home. The chicken was cold. Not warm or lukewarm, cold like cold cold, but it still tasted good. The corn bread was dry and bland. The grits could have used more salt but that's all preference. Not sure how the creamed spinach was made but has a slight off putting taste to it. The Mac and Cheese was okay, comparable to Chick-fil-a not sure if that's saying much. Even though the food wasn't what I expected and pretty high in price. The service was A1 so nice and welcoming. We didn't even eat there and we were impressed.

Alyse M.,/user_details?userid=wyZ-AHtdJIY96dIiDOUVCw,"Brooklyn, NY",4/7/2015,1.0,I came in to this restaurant excited to try there fired chicken the food came out at a decent time. However the meal was absolutely horrible and when I asked the manager if he could take it off the bill because I hadn't touch my food he refused to do so. He told me he would discount it I was fine with that only to find out that he only took off $15 from a $75 bill which still came out to me paying for the entire meal. The manager left me being unhappy he didn't seem to care at all if I was happy or not. I don't recommend this place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peaches-hothouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Came  on a double date for brunch on a Saturday. I had the hot fried chicken with the potato salad . Personally, I didn't like the Potato salad. I was expecting small pieces of potato but the potato pieces were quite large. The chicken is actually mediocre . Yes it's hot and spicy but it's not due to the seasoning. They just sprinkle cayenne pepper AFTER the chicken has been fried. So I bite into my chicken and I have a sneeze fest because the cayenne pepper is ALL OVER . That's lazy cooking if you ask me. On the other hand, the drinks were very very good. The place is super tiny and only has about 8 tables.

Up until recently this was my go-to neighborhood spot. I think ""what you get"" is determined by the mood of the staff on that particular shift. I placed a to go order on the night of July 9th and we waited over 45 minutes even while the restaurant was fairly empty toward closing time. Not to mentioned we had to flag someone down to take our initial order. The server and staff we had were preoccupied with everything but customer service. We had to go in to retrieve our food and found out that it had been sitting there for some time. They offered a piece of fried chicken as a peace offering, but I think by then we were checked out. We opened the food at home and it was cold, with some items being undercooked. Again, I'm a fan usually, but this left a negative impression.

We stumbled on this little hole in the wall. It's about 10:35pm at this time. We parked and walked into a calm small space, upon entry there was no acknowledgement. We grabbed a menu and looked at it. We laughed a little about the chicken being ""too spicy"" & decided to give it a go. At this point a few mins have passed and still no one even greeted us. The servers a male & female continue to move around busily & the bartender having a fruitful conversation with a gentleman continue to ignore us. I tried to get the servers attention and was ignored. A few mins later the bartender walks over with a serious face & blurts out ""you want to order"" & then a the male server hops out of no where and pins in ""To Go"" so my husband responded with ""we were trying to dine in"" the male server with an attitude repeats ""to go"". At this point I no longer felt welcome here & lost my appetite so I asked my husband to leave. I told the male server it's unprofessional the way you're running your business. You're rude and need a different approach. Being rude and chasing patrons out of your restaurant isn't a way to run a business. When we got outside of the restaurant the male server followed us out to point out on the door that they closed at 11pm. My husband and I was then attacked verbally by the male server, the MANAGER who was sitting outside having a smoke & 2 other men who came out of the restaurant behind us. ( BTW the MANAGER told us to mind our own business when I told the server he's rude & needs to learn how to speak to his customers properly & not rude. Instead of standing there repeating ""To Go"" say ""I'm sorry we're about to close in a few but if you'd like we can wrap it up to go would have worked more effectively"") Never again will I attempt to go here or recommend this place.  My first and hopefully my last NEGATIVE review.

I LOVE Nashville hot chicken but really haven't found anything as good outside of Tennessee. I'm pretty sure this is as good as it gets in New York City. To start, I recommend the barbecue shrimp. While they weren't amazing, they were quite delicious. I really liked the corn bread that it came with. Their specialty whiskey cocktails are also unbelievably good. To eat, you have to get the hot chicken. They can do it all white meat too if you ask! I got it hot and my fiance got it extra hot. The hot was hot enough for me and he was suffering a bit with the extra hot but it's definitely not too hot to handle. It comes with a side and I loved the mac & cheese. It also comes with delicious cornbread. The service here is great. However, be prepared to be smushed as they certainly pack in as many chairs and tables as can fit.

When our to go food arrived we prepared to eat it at the bar when we heard audible sighs and saw eye rolling from bartender #2. Proactively, I asked if we weren't welcomed to eat at the bar, as she said ""actually, no you have to leave, you're not a dine in order"", although we were still waiting to finish the drinks that finally arrived. The two bartenders proceeded to vocalize their frustrations behind the bar and in earshot of my friend and I.  ""They know the policy"" Karli said.

I haven't eaten collard greens out in forever but, I had to have a taste. PH delivered on the flavor, the greens are right.  But, my sister said not so the catfish. I didn't taste it but, I don't doubt it. I had the fried chicken and mac. Again the side was delightful but, the meat was missing something. I ordered mild but, fried chicken shouldn't need spicy spices to be flavorful. I expect all my chicken fried to finger lickin' goodness. The service was great as was dessert. Lastly my nieces French fries were not fresh and she barely ate them. I love all fries, even bad, so her plate didn't reflect her displeasure but . . . they made a sad showing for fried potatoes. What was consistent was the service and the beverages. The host and waitstaff almost made up for the off night in the kitchen.

The kale was way to salty and tasted over seasoned. The fried chicken was okay, did not like the seasoning they put on top of it and it kept getting in my nose lol. My cousin ordered the ribs, hers was okay but didn't have enough sauce for her and requested bbq sauce on the side. Overall, it is okay. The atmosphere is nice but the restaurant is very small.

Cassandra H.,/user_details?userid=_6iQ8J6A5rUR8S2HgCu7Fw,"Brooklyn, NY",5/1/2017,2.0,"THIS PLACE IS TOTALLY OVERRATED. Now with that said, there wasn't anything particularly bad about this place it just wasn't good. It was my girlfriend and I first time here so we walked into the restaurant and was confused as to who works there and what to do. There is a board right outside of the door that you're supposed to sign your name on, fine. The wait was 45 minutes and I think with a wait that long there should be someone offering menus so that you can at least have a drink while waiting but no one did. We got drinks anyway. The sparkling wine was great and the other drinks were okay.  My girlfriend and I had the fried chicken and mac and cheese, cole slaw and grits. The chicken came with cornbread that had the flavor of cake and the texture of really stale cake, no good. The sides were okay but our favorite was the cole slaw everything else was one note. As for the fried chicken...whomp whomp, seriously! The crispy coating on the outside was great but then you get to the meat and it is just bland. I mean BLAND. There wasn't even a slight taste of salt, good lord! I mean look, it's cute and cheap but I wouldn't even eat any of those items again. Is it a dead end for me? No but I probably wont be coming back anytime soon nor can I give the word of mouth to come here.

Very small venue.  The wait wasn't too bad on a Sunday night.  Food came quickly.  It was my first time.  It wasn't made clear that you needed to sign your name on a white board by the door to get a seat.  You also need to sign the board to sit at the bar.  I wanted takeout but there was no clear directions on how to get it because you can't get it at the bar. You needed to go to the back window and order.  There is no where to sit or stand so the only negative thing I have to say is that my food got cold cause no one told me it was ready!  It was just back there sitting with all the other to go orders getting cold.  The hot chicken is good.  Really good.   I ate greens for the side.  It was bomb too.  I generally don't like greens made at restaurants but these are exceptionally good.  The catfish nuggets were on point too!  Not over breaded or overcooked.  I'm going to go back and eat again before I head home!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peaches-hothouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I think this is one of the better chicken spots around Bedford, but it falls short to a lot of 5-star rated Southern restaurants around here simply because the service is less than satisfying. I didn't take the reviews I read about this spot to heart but they were more or less right. My waitress was slow as molasses, and so inattentive she might as well have been deaf.

Moist meat and a crunch that is just right and not too heavy.

This place is a cozy little spot. We had to double check the tiny sign in the front window to make sure it's the right place. We got here around 1 pm on a Saturday. The bar was empty so we sat there. (The place got pretty busy around 2pm when we were leaving so I guess we got there just in time.) I ordered the granola crusted French toast with bourbon peaches and the husband had egg whites scrambled with kale, sundried tomatoes, and goat cheese with a side of crispy grits. Service was pretty quick and the food was good. We ordered coffees and only when the check came did we realize it was bottomless (free refills). Didn't really like the fact that they didn't have milk for the coffee and we had to use the tiny half and half cups.

We actually had to disturb another party who had to stand up to let us slide into the seats. After the waitress who skipped us came to take our order, we mentioned getting skipped again by the people sitting right behind us.

The chicken is flavorful crispy and good. I've had the chicken before and it's usually not greasy but one out of my two pieces was a little on the greasy side and I didn't care for that too much.

Josefina B.,/user_details?userid=9No9RCeuSm0M2G56ZvNjHw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/14/2016,3.0,I enjoyed this place immensely. I was craving fried chicken and decided to check it out this past Saturday. It is very small so be prepared to wait for at least an hour on weekends. There is a board when you get there and you have to sign in. It is not the best system because anyone could erase tour name and place their name before yours since no one is really monitoring the list. I ordered the friends chicken. It was amazing! I did not get the spicy chicken because I was afraid that I would get heartburn after but my daughter told me that her chicken sandwich was spicy and it was not that bad since we are Caribbean on our scale she thought it was not that bad. You get side orders with the chicken so I got mac and cheese. It was awful. No flavor and bland. Do not get it. The French fries are excellent seasoned and the grits were amazing. I had two cocktails they were quite good. The bartender was friendly. Overall a great experience and will definitely go back when I feel for some good fried chicken.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peaches-hothouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ordered the blackend chicken and a side of macaroni and cheese and they were both okay. The chicken was a little on the dry side but I enjoyed the macaroni and cheese. The kitchen was backed up because of a large party but the waitress was very nice and kept us updated with our food and comped a couple of our drinks for the long wait. The brownie was soo good! It was large especially after eating dinner so I had to take it home but it was still good a few days later.

I started off with the fried green tomato appetizer - interestingly topped with bacon. I couldn't resist ordering. I'm not sure what I imagined but it came to me as, i believe it was, four fried green tomato slices...covered by a small salad, which itself was criss-crossed with 2 slices of bacon. It was tasty but the fried green tomatoes cld have done with a but of seasoning for the breading. I ordered next the fried chicken (hot). First off it wasn't too hot (but then again I like things spicy). The portion size was quite generous! It looked so tasty I paused to appreciate it before digging in. First bite: crunchy, moist, yummy and a bit of spice. It is not the best I've ever had (I am from the deep South after all) but it was respectable and enjoyable. I did wish for a bit of salt or seasoned salt worked into the batter/breading...Also had a drink, served in sort of a jelly glass which I LOVED. I like the sort of ""juke joint"" feel of the place...casual and relaxed. I felt like I was at my grandmother's down south during a family reunion when the cool part of the family comes and starts playing their music and hitting the table yelling and playing cards or dominoes...this wasn't happening at Peaches, it wasn't loud or rowdy, but it felt like the sort of place u cld get comfortable and feel at home in!

Spending time dining in house have been mixed but positive overall. Great food but not always the absolute best service. Tonight, Peaches won me as a real big supporter. Tonight the staff flexed and turned up for me in an honest way. My girlfriend and I took seats at the bar and a guy who had been sitting took standing room next to my girlfriend's chair talking to another woman nearby. His elbow was sticking into my girlfriend's back and she asked him to give space and he dismissed her saying ""it's going to be tight"". We would have been more permissible if he asked us to scoot or move over a bit. He was out of his mind angry when my girlfriend finally moved over her chair after he continued to lean into her. Peaches does not have standing room bar space. So when he got aggressive, we confronted him saying No, Stop It. He and I stood flexing chests  while I told him to keep cool and give us our space. He was not nice and very rude. I asked to bartender to figure things out and the bar tender responded to our needs and told him to calm down.

We ordered our lunch I got the fried chicken because it was said to be the best i also got a side of greens and my cousin got the Mac and cheese so we could share. Now the reason I give this place 3 stars is because everyone's food came out besides mines only my greens came out. I thought since I ordered fried chicken maybe it took s little longer but I was still sitting there. Finally one of the waiters asked me if I wanted a plate and I said no I'm waiting for my order. So right away he went to the back to check....somehow my order didn't get mad so they had to make it  I was starving but I got a drink on the house while I waited. Then they gave me free cornbread which was soooo good and apologized for the wait. Finally my food came out and they apologized again and told me my meal was on the house! I dug into my chicken right away and it was so good they have house made hot sauce and that was awesome also. Anyways I finished what I could took the rest home and as I was leaving the serving apologized again.

I've ate here many times so I had a measuring stick to judge from. The chicken was not crisp or spicy. The extra spicy was not even regular spicy. It was just mildly spicy chicken all around. My friends order was suppose to be JUMBO shrimp. The shrimp was not even large. Medium shrimp is served in place of JUMBO. On the menu it says JUMBO, yet they continue to serve the wrong size prawns.

So as I am waiting for my fried green tomatoes, I am thinking to myself this better be worth the wait. Well after the first bite of my appetizer I was hooked. The chicken arrived piping hot and moist and incredibly delicious accompanied by kale with garlic. Of course, I couldn't leave without dessert but decided to take it back home.

After the experience in the south, I totally agreed with her and went for regular. In the meanwhile, my expectation was driven higher by her suggestion. The brunch stuff was ok in general, but the chicken was very disappointing. The crust wasn't crispy, and the meat wasn't as juicy as it should be. Most importantly, it wasn't spicy at all.

Will R.,/user_details?userid=zTHK_nlgh8Bz_AXPksPKng,"Minneapolis, MN",3/23/2013,4.0,"Finally, somewhere in NYC that can actually make  decent fried chicken. I say finally because I've tried it at lots of places. I'll never understand how some of restaurants in NYC get credit for making ""good"" fried chicken. Peaches Hot House is the only place I've experienced that deserves such praise. They obviously use the method my family uses, which is a double buttermilk coating with seasoned flour. It's what insures an amazing crust that sticks to the chicken. It's good stuff, though I take issue with it because it seemed deep fried instead of pan fried (the deep frying insures an even frying but sometimes it over-fries portion of the chicken), but as I said it is still very good. They claim the extra hot stuff is incendiary, but I asked for extra hot sauce (I made the mistake of rubbing my eyes midway through the meal, which caused a temporary medical issue with my eye, notes to everyone, don't rub your eyes after eating the extra hot stuff!). The sides were equally good, the Kale and mashed potatoes were very fresh and delicious, much healthier than the usual Southern variety. The big let down was the cornbread, that was obviously prepared that morning and then heated up, it seemed like warm dry cake instead of hot moist cornbread. Perhaps the standout dishes of the evening were our appetizer and dessert. We ordered the fried green tomatos, they were amazing but they cheated and added bacon, which makes everything amazing right? The mustardy sauce that came with them was great, without the bacon they aren't as good as what we make back South, but I'll be damned what an innovation!!!! I'll be utilizing it myself the next time I make them. The dessert was wonderful, a double chocolate pound cake with fresh frosting. This was the perfect end to a heavy dinner, it made us even more full but in a great way. Delicious. Their drink list is excellent and they cleverly name their cocktails after great  Southern Blues and Jazz musicians, anywhere that names a drink after the great R.L. Burnside is cool in my book. My wife had a Billie Holiday which was amazing. Their beer list is small but very good, they have a range: an  IPA, a good Lager, a pilsner, a heffeweizen, and an excellent porter for after your meal. The staff was very friendly and highly efficient, we were never left unattended for longer than 5 minutes. Our drinks were always full and the meal came out fast. All in all I was really surprised by this place. It's a bit pricey for the neighborhood, but the food and service are worth it. If you'r a Southern expatriate or simply  enjoy Southern food give this place a shot. I'm sure you'll enjoy. Go early though because it is a very small space and by the time we left (7:30) there was a short line forming outside. Go though, and enjoy!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peaches-hothouse-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

What I do remember however is that I ate here twice in a week, and loved it each time! Obviously eat the fried chicken but there was a guy next to me who had their french toast, which is made on egg bread and it looked AMAZING. I had the corncakes with sausage and omg was it delicious. The second time I had one of their specials for Brooklyn Food or Restaurant week? Something like that and it was a very good deal. My friend and I got one of their specials which was $28 for two, you really can't beat that, and it was plenty of food w/dessert. I believe we had chicken, kale and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese wasn't anything to write home about and I thought the dessert was very ok. I would probably skip both next time. I had very delicious cocktails here too and the staff was extremely kind which I'm not accustomed to in NY. In any case if you find yourself in Bed-Stuy and you're craving quality homecooking go to Peaches Hothouse, not to be confused with Peaches.

We tried the dishes from a number of places and everything tasted great. Loved the Thai food we had a shrimp appetizer and pad Thai, at the Indian place chicken roti and samosas, mango lassi and Japanese ramen.

Christine M.,/user_details?userid=KshZyjReJo3keKzGvYRxEA,"New York, NY",10/2/2022,4.0,Great spot to spend an afternoon. So many different food options to choose from. I would compare this to a much smaller version of Chelsea market with more seating options. Communal seating is setup throughout the market and on a nice day the rooftop would be the perfect spot to hang out. I dined at Fornino Pizza and ordered the Calabrese Pizza. Pizza was tasty and made with fresh ingredients! Would love to go back and try more restaurants. Honestly one could spend breakfast until dinner here. Highly recommend checking this place out. Tip: Evil Twin Brewery is a few minutes walk away. Make a day of it and explore more spots in Dumbo!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ingrid S.,/user_details?userid=vXAUaZSn7reLfjLk73MeeA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/5/2022,4.0,"There are things I like and hate about the market. It's overcrowded beyond belief. Or at least when I came in this past Saturday afternoon. But there also was a holiday market going on as well as the World Cup so maybe that had some factor. Everything is a little bit over-priced. It's hard to figure out what you're getting the most bang for your buck but I guess if you circle enough times you'll find something worth indulging in. I didn't check out the roof top but I'm sure the views are worth it. It was pouring rain and I hastily ordered my food to dine in on china-ware so I figured out the hard way that you can't bring glass up to the roof when trying to meet my friend. Anyway, I ended up getting Jacob's Pickles' buffalo mac and cheese for $15 plus tax plus a heavily insistent that I tip, even though it's self serve. Oh well. I was torn between that and a ramen spot because that seemed like a hefty portion for $20-ish dollars and a great day for a huge bowl of it. But the portion size for the buffalo mac was hearty and huge. Enough so that I saved about half for today's lunch. My friend tried Bark Bbq that's brand new. I trust people with how delicious the bbq is but man are the portions small for how much you spend. She ended up getting 2 ribs, a piece of cornbread, and like 3 or 4 plantains for $21 or $22. Everything she said tasted great but maybe not the price tag. Ended our meal with Sugar Hill Creamery. They let us sample a few flavors before deciding. I went with the Harlem Sweeties which was a salted caramel ice cream with butterscotch and brownies and the other flavor I got was the peppermint bark ice cream cake. Man, both were great. They also serve your ice cream in a legitimate huge ass cone that doesn't cost extra. We will have none of those garbage tasting cones nonsense. Thank you. Giving Ample Hills a run for their money. It's convenient for having tons of options if you're with folks that don't want to eat at the same spot but seating is really hard to knab. Got to be at the right time and place and I guess that makes me a deer in headlights and annoys me. Dumbo desperately needed this though because it's been destitute of good bars and spots to eat for awhile.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

If you get take out you can even go up to the rooftop park (not bar) & eat with a view! Love that you have access all the well known restaurants in one place. Great for those visiting New York. For those from NY, the prices here in my opinion is too much & with limited options. For me I got three Al Pastor tacos with a lemonade from Ivy Stark Mexology & that came out to be $25. Travel down to Sunset Park on the N and you'll have more delicious authentic tacos for 1/4 the price. My husband got 2 small sliders also for $20 (no drinks, no sides). It was good, but not worth the price good. Otherwise, very trendy place.

I specifically tried some wings from the Thai place as well as the garlic tonkonstu ramen. They both tasted good but they both didn't really stand out in any way. The ramen was very good and it was a decent portion - I liked the broth and texture of the noodles. As for the wings, I wasn't really expecting the flavor but it was still good and it was very crispy. Overall, I'm glad I was able to finally try some of the food from the market.

While it's not the best spot for breakfast (only two vendors open early enough for breakfast), it's a great spot for later in the day. Tons of vendors: Clinton St. Baking Company, Little Neck Raw Bar, Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors, Fornino, Sugar Hill Creamery, Bubusan, Jacob's Pickles, and on and on... We got bagels from Ess-a-Bagel and took them outside. And that's really the highlight of Time Out Market - the view!!! There are lots of outside tables (and apparently a rooftop, although we didn't make it there) - and the view of the East River and the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges is fantastic.

So I was gonna get a dessert. DOUGH donuts were there and hell no I'm not buying another  $6 donut. LA BELLA FERRARA had a variety of cannolis but they were so miniscule for  $5 a pop. SUGAR HILL CREAMERY offered ice cream at a ridiculous price. So I left without eating anything. However, theTIME OUT MARKET is a good place to check out. I know there are locations in Miami and Boston supporting local vendors.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

While in the TOM I realized there was a Tiki Chick, so we ordered 2 pina coladas(10$ each)& 2 single chick sandwiches($5 each)-when the guy rang us up it was 44$(?), I was alittle confused & I ask the cashier, he pointed at the chalkboard at idk what & didn't say a word(?), so whatever I paid & tipped. When we got the receipt it said ""2 Combos"", 15$(?)each and extra 5 each for the Pina Coladas(?), ok whatever AGAIN. When we received our COMBOS WE DIDNT ORDER & our pina coladas. WE REALIZED HE GAVE IS THE WRONG FOOD! Went back up to the cashier & he just took food off another tray & put it on our tray-NO WORDS SPOKEN AGAIN(?) So then, we realized there was no alcohol in our drinks(?), so we went back up again to the cashier and asked if there was alcohol in our drinks, HE POINTED AGAIN AT THE CHALKBOARD(?!), no words again & with a nasty attitude(?)-IN SMALL PRINT ON THIS BUSY CHALKBOARD IT SAID ""we do not serve alcohol"", WOW!!!!!? We then decided to leave. I went up to get a to go box. THIS PERSON THEN ROLLED HIS EYES AT ME, slammed the bag/box on the counter(?)...I said thank you, he walked away & leaned on the wall & was texting on his phone(?). This was the worst service I've ever had in my life. And sorry Tiki Chick YOU SHOULD MAKE IT KNOWN IN BIG LETTERS THAT YOU DO NOT SERVE ALCOHOL!

I ordered spaghetti and butternut squash soup from the pasta vendor. Both were delicious and multiple people stopped to ask where I ordered the dishes.

The market does not disappoint. On the bottom floor some food vendors include Fish Cheeks selling delicious Thai food and fresh oysters, Bessou with their fried crispy rice topped with sashimi, Alta Calidad and their variety of tacos, among many others. The layout is appealing with plenty of tables to enjoy whichever food you choose. We split some tacos at Alta Calidad, but I had I gone to the rooftop first, I definitely would have gotten food there instead. The rooftop has beautiful views of the river, an impressive bar, and additional food vendors including Nur. However, it is clear Time Out has vetted all of these vendors, carefully choosing the best.

Jing K.,/user_details?userid=t_O7iyu3Ceqp43hX625qWg,"Manhattan, NY",3/16/2020,3.0,"5 stars for location 4 stars for food and price 2 stars for dining and drinks logistics issues. Great location right next to the Brooklyn waterfront by Janes Carousel. Plenty of good food options from ramen to sushi, chicken and biscuits, sandwiches, oysters, and plenty more. All players seem to be around $8-$10 appetizers and $15-$30 entrees depending on which establishment you go to and where you order. The only downside is that indoor seating is very limited with a small counter at each stand and a dozen or so communal tables by the main entrance. There are  park benches and tables outside but because the food is served in actual plates that becomes a lot of weight to carry when you're trying to find a table and also not drop anything. The biggest issue however is drinks. Food vendors do not sell or serve drinks and that includes water and soda not to mention Alcoholic beverages. So in order to get a drink you now have to carry your food to one of the many bars and order it there. Seems like an unnecessary step. Also when you're done eating you have to bring your plates and utensils back inside otherwise it'll just pile up on the outdoor tables and no one will be about to sit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Came on a Memorial Day and the hall was not as advertised. Only about 6 vendors open on the ground floor out of about 20 stalls, and the 6 were completely overwhelmed. Despite the empty stalls, the layout of the market makes for very tight spaces with very low ceilings, not the best when you are still in a pandemic, waiting 20 minutes in line to order and another 45 minutes to receive supposedly ""fast casual"" food. And the pricing is insane: $13 for a very mediocre Mac and cheese, $27 for a salad with shrimp. Much higher than the pricing for the same food at other locations (like jacobs pickles and Clinton st baking company).

The rooftop bar has amazing views (even the outdoor space on the lower level has a top notch view of Manhattan). The food choices are high end but reasonably priced. You'll be tempted to dabble in all the options but you could easily spend $15-20 bucks at each vendor. Roughly $8-10 for a beer and $13-15 for cocktails. The rooftop bar has a separate liquor license from the main level on the ground floor so although you can drink in both areas, you can't travel up and down with your beer. I ate the margarita pizza with pepperoni from Juliana's on the roof and then the Mel's Double Burger at Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors on the ground floor - both excellent renditions of the classics that I highly recommend. This place is such a great addition to the DUMBO scene!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

From the quick glances that I made there are a good amount of vendors and a lot of unfamiliar dishes to me, with that being said I wasn't so thrilled to try much. One vendor I did try was Jacobs Pickles with their famous Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese ($15). It was good, very cheesy and creamy, good about of chicken good amount of heat. I also checked out the bar the bartender helped me out & I choose the J&G drink ($13). It has good flavors but no kick to it, lots of ice & it went down like juice. Pretty disappointing for the price. There's very little outdoor seatings but there's beautiful views out there!

MT L.,/user_details?userid=DGMkum0hDYRNTz8HGz3BNw,"New York, NY",2/15/2020,4.0,"I very much enjoyed the crispy rice trio with salmon, spicy tuna, and yellowtail from Bessou at Time Out Market. However, the market and seating were spread between the first and fifth floors, the latter being less crowded but with more expensive food options (it also features a view, though partially blocked by a bandstand stage and a bar). The weekend crowd made carrying loaded trays difficult and also led to a scarcity of seating, especially for groups of three or more. I saw quite a few people hoarding spaces even before they obtained their food (maybe a seating host could assist during busy times?). Fortunately, the tables were bussed quickly and efficiently. The line for the restroom was also quite long -- surprising for the fact that the space had two bars and a coffee shop -- though they did have an attendant assisting there. The biggest disappointment was the water filling station; it was an ice water dispenser at the front bar with a sign stating ""Please do not fill your water bottle here.

Gabriel U.,/user_details?userid=1hzqiZUivGQfkPFWEoT5Gw,"New York, NY",6/8/2019,2.0,"Not the best experience. The idea of it is cute, but once you get there, see all the dirty tables, all the lines, and all the people that idea goes away. We saw so many people having to clean their own tables and put the dirty dishes on other tables so that they could have a seat. There's no clear designation for dirty dishes/ trays when you're done with them so customers just end up leaving the table dirty, and there was no one cleaning them up so everything was just accumulated. Took us close to an hour to find a table (it was dirty) and close to another hour to get our food. We tried the Broccoli Gnocchi from Felice Pasta Bar and I would give that dish a 3/5. It was eh and I was still hungry after (my boyfriend couldn't finish the plate, said it was all mush). We then tried the Vegan Quesadilla from BKLYN WILD and that was a 2/5. We both couldn't finish it, it was cold when we got it despite picking it up as soon as the buzzer went off, and it was very bland. The star of the show for us was the Mac and Cheese from Jacob's Pickles. Easiest the best mac and cheese we've all had. 5/5. It was cooked perfectly, had the perfect amount of cheese, and the slightly crunchy layer on top was amazing. Apart from that, you do get a nice view of the river if you go towards the back/ the third floor, but that doesn't really outweigh the unkemptness, crowds, and eh food for me to go back when I'm in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However, I am overall disappointed with this time out market. The two floor layout makes it hard to navigate and the identical signage of the vendors makes it hard to find what you are looking for.

Milo S.,/user_details?userid=hykYfWp8ZxAVpsdOHD3yZQ,"Brooklyn, NY",10/7/2019,1.0,"Disappointing experience at Little Ada market tonight. I ordered the salad nicoise and asked for no pita. I wasn't sure the person working the counter totally understood my order, so I clarified. A couple of times.  I paid and waited patiently for my order. What arrived looked suspiciously like hummus with some Israeli tabbouleh on top, and despite my specific request to the contrary, came with a large chunk of pita on the side. Reserving judgment so far. I dug in  hoping I would discover some fish inside there nestled among the...hummus. Which would be a strange combination, but I was in a hurry and decided to go with it. Turned out it was a generous order of hummus with Israeli tabbouleh, which was tasty, but definitely not what I ordered, despite my repeated clarifications. I was pressed for time, so I left.

I'm actually not trying to review Time Out Market New York, which in itself, is a very unique food hall that has all the offerings you could ask for. I am actuall trying to review a certain restaraunt in Time Out Market New York called Little Ada, a hummus bar. It's a quaint little place in the market, with quite a variety of options. The staff behind the counter were very kind, and I ordered the Chicken Shwarma. That being said, the prices were EXTREMELY high, a big reason for why I did not give it as many stars as I would have liked. My shwarma cost $16, and despite the amount of food being a little more than a normal shwarma order, it was still not justifiable to be that much. Along with this, the wait time was fairly long, taking around 11 minutes to finish my order while other restaraunts in the market took significantly less time to prepare food. Ultimately, if the food hadn't been so expensive with the wait time being a bit shorter m, I would've definetely given it more stars, but in total, it is a solid restaurant that I do recommend to individuals visiting the market.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

After 10 min of being ignored we came to the area she was in and still not even a smile or a hello its like me and my boy friend were not even there. I got upset cause three white girls came to the same spot i was in and she went up to them introduced herself and set napkins for them and took they order. We were finally helped after the bar was empty and her introduction was Not a hi but what do you want which was very rude to me. I ordered two Brooklyn Lager and left her no tip.

They took our order, made the drinks very fast but they tasted terrible - overly sweetened and very alcoholic.

Katelyn R.,/user_details?userid=DBYr7UkWsTAidZufWGtoaQ,"Morristown, NJ",7/6/2019,2.0,"Overall, we had a great experience at the Time Out Market until we made our way up to the rooftop to grab some drinks at the bar. The bartenders were VERY rude and insulting. I accidentally mispronounced the drink name and the bartender pointed it out to us in a very nasty way. We also had another question about a drink and the bartenders respond was ""Wow I guess you guys really can't read"". Your job is to know some information about the drinks you are serving! We were buying bottles and the bartender handed us glasses that were dirty and still had lipstick marks on them from previous customers. Don't you know you should wipe off glasses to get rid of extra marks? When we asked them for different glasses the bartender pretended to put our glasses back but still gave us the same glasses with an even bigger attitude. I thought maybe this bartender was having a bad day since the service we received from this person was terrible but when we went back to get some more drinks another bartender treated us just as terrible. If you have the patience to put up with rude, nasty, insulting bartenders then this is a great place. The bartenders don't even look you in the eye or say hi to you. Luckily we were with great company so we looked past all those things but if your going to be rude to customers in the bartending industry then maybe this is not the job for you. The choices in the food court and servers keeping the food court clean were so friendly and helpful! Keep up the great work .. maybe you can spread some cheer up to those bartenders at the rooftop bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's great to dine alfresco! This was the first time I tasted a draft Italian lager; I liked it. After checking out the two red by the glass,  my dining companion preferred the Primo Segno. The Negroni was of course wonderful. The complimentary bread was very delicious!  Of the antipasti we ordered,  the delicata squash and the maitake mushroom were both excellent. The little gem lettuce salad was very fresh, albeit with a tad too much dressing. For pasta, the Clam Tonnarelli with thicker noodles and tastier, creamy sauce stood out better than the Smoked aglio olio.  The generous portion of soft gnocchi tasted superb in a sweetish cheesy squash sauce. The  agnolotti del plum of very flavorful ravioli-like mini pouches of braised meat was also rich and yummy. These pastas were all well-made and masterful interpretations of classic Italian favorites.

Considering the game was on things came out at weird times (we didn't mind we understand the situation and we're actually full and needed a break in between). But everything was presented beautifully and tasted fantastic. I especially loved the agnolotti which reminded me of the Neapolitan pasta alla genovese but reimagined. The gnudi were perfectly made and soo cheesy and pillowy almost like a matza ball with the most delicious sauce! I used the table focaccia to fare la scarpetta with it-- amazing.

The food was great - from antipasti, a choice of two pastas, then a second course and dessert - everything was delicious. We got a lot of comments from our guests about how good the food was. The service was spectacular as well. Everyone working there was very friendly and easy to work with. LaRina was also great about catering to our guests' dietary restrictions ... we had a vegan, people who are gluten free, etc., and all were well taken care of.

We came for the lasagna that had been highly reviewed on social media only to find out the item not listed on the menu. We ordered two other pasta dishes as a substitute and were okay with our choices until we noticed our server taking much better care of the guests seated next to us. Our server was extremely short with us and engaged in as minimal conversation as possible.  He advised the table next to use that the lasagna was not on the menu but very popular - he failed to share this information with us. Our service also failed to bring bread to our table but strangely remember to bring it to the other tables in our section. Our server did not refill our water during our meal and ever brought out additional staff when he brought us the check. The additional staff stood around our table until we had paid our bill. 1 stars because the pasta was good, 0 starts for service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Everything we ate was perfect, from the bread at the beginning of the meal to the octopus to the untouchable pasta dish -- we got the wrong one by mistake (no fault of the staff, my boyfriend haphazardly pointed out selection out on the menu so as not to mispronounce, which is not the clearest way to order) and it was SO GOOD that I was thrilled we didn't get our original selection, although I'm sure that would have been delicious too. The staff was so warm and lovely, helpful and elegant yet unpretentious. Answered our questions with eagerness and aplomb and suggested a great wine for us. We were blown away.

Our appetizer was so good I could have ordered three more. If you love a good meat/cheese play, try the prosciutto salad. The runny cheese served with it was the perfect compliment to an awesome dish. Then our pastas were very nice, also. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente. The lasagna was rich and heavenly although lacking salt, in my opinion. This restaurant deserved at least a four star rating until dessert came. The eggplant mousse was bizarre. I know what you're thinking - that sounds TERRIBLE so why did I order it? Well, I was intrigued. But it really missed the mark and was quite unappealing. Crumbly bits of pound cake, peaches and then the grey eggplant mousse....yeah...stick with the homemade pasta.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Stephen S.,/user_details?userid=jkcsmMTnE5Nl-6z5Y428uA,"New York, NY",8/4/2019,5.0,"One of the best meals I've recently had, hands down if talking Italian. Stuffed zucchini flowers were good, but great when paired with the Italian draft beer (birra Antoniana - such a beautiful color too). Hickory smoked spaghetti with olive oil and garlic had beautiful depth and flavor (especially comparing it to my homemade non-smoked version from last night). And the sorbet made from Sicilian citrus took me away to the coast (especially after watching the documentary How to Live to 100 on Amazon Prime). It went amazing with the bubbles of the Italian sparkling water. Perfect destination for a bike ride from Gramercy!!!

The food was beautiful. But what totally ruined this special night was the manager coming over to our table and rudely asking us to leave like we'd been there too long. There were many tables in the restaurant free. She wasn't polite in her conversation. She acted like we ""should've known"" that we needed to go. When I addressed her rudeness she got even more ""stank"" and said that she didn't think she was rude. Her tone and aggressiveness totally ruined our outing for my birthday. I will never go there again based on that treatment. We spent over $200 at the restaurant, and THAT'S the way we're treated in return? No thanks. The customer is always right.

Anthony S.,/user_details?userid=vJKFVNaGO_ZdEapD_c2UUw,"Manhattan, NY",1/16/2021,3.0,Stopped by around 430 for a cocktail - multiple parties seated at tables in the front but met by a tall man with slick hair in a jacket uneager to accommodate us because diner didn't start til 5. After agreeing that a cheese and meat plate was acceptable as the food requirement we were seated under a lovely heat lamp out front. Staff was entirely friendly and kind except for the same tall man we met at the beginning. After first being given our drinks and food the tall man came back to check in - but then refused to acknowledge us for the next 45 minutes - after our glasses sat empty for half an hour and attempting to politely gain his attention we finally were miraculously able to flag him down to order another round. After a bit another of the lovely staff checked in on us and we decided it was probably a good idea  to order another round rather than wait on the tall man again. 10 minutes after receiving our drinks tall man arrives to tell us that our table is reserved for 7pm (it is 6:50) and that there are benches to the side we can sit at (unheated now after dusk in January). No alternative was offered. No other forewarning. We took our full glasses to the benches where we sat drinking and facing a table under heaters that sat empty the entire time we finished our drinks. Avoid the pale man with slick hair and suit coat - how absurdly prudish. Unfortunate that one person can spoil a whole restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'd highly suggest making a reservation as our walk in attempts had failed. I ended up having the spaghetti aglio e olio and my boyfriend got the linguine al ricci di mare. The portions are really small, so would get an app. If you want bread...you have to pay for it, which is pretty absurd. My pasta itself was fine - a little bland but I did like the hot pepper hints.

Waiter handled the situation terribly. He was so nonchalant, killed the bug, then went about his other tasks. No apology from the waiter or asking if we're okay and wanted to move. No one cared to say anything until I was walking out the door and voiced to the manager the lack of care and consideration for their diners. Indoors or outdoors no one wants to dine with roaches. The manager wanted to normalize this by saying ""nyc is the dirtiest city in America."" That may be true, but I've never dined at a restaurant and had a cockroach crawl across my table. And the waiter not even address it. They offered us free drinks and dessert in the front patio. Still cockroaches were in the front area as well.

Jackie D.,/user_details?userid=csFkf4qsMZeZGFU6EcDk7A,"Manhattan, NY",6/11/2019,5.0,Their specials are my go to!! They have such an amazing menu and the selection of cheese's is always spot on.  I tried things that I would've never tried before thanks to them.  The staff there is always wonderful and if you can get a spot in the backyard its probably the best part of LaRina.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Eden J.,/user_details?userid=P1krI4pq5ZKVb2tKhQkQjQ,"Hoboken, NJ",8/18/2020,5.0,"Their store is fantastic and the owner is so sweet! We've tried the mascarpone ravioli and the rigatoni - both were so fresh and delicious. Their pesto trapanese is my new favorite sauce and they have a solid wine selection as well. We tried the La Rina red wine and they sold it at cost. So glad to have a local spot for fresh pasta, sauce and wine!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Douglas F.,/user_details?userid=7npcR5KrubhTxwgYGmpHLA,"New York, NY",3/28/2021,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place. It's a really cute spot and based on reviews I had high expectations. Unfortunately, the best part of the meal was the bread. The octopus starter fell beyond flat. It was incredibly salty and the octopus tasted like it was made days in advance; it was the texture of a pencil eraser.  We shared a few pasta dishes and the only one I'd even consider again was the ""nude"" special pasta. It was the only one out of the three that was palatable honestly. I'm far from a discerning pasta person, but the dishes were so salty that they couldn't even be eaten. It was like the only thing they used to season anything was salt. Onto dessert where the tiramisu was fair -- I've definitely had better. The Italian ""donuts"" were awful. While everything else was overpowered by salt, these chocolate filled donuts had an unidentifiable creme that was light brown and appeared to be chocolate but had zero taste.  In any case, I don't know if it was just a bad night for them, but I likely wouldn't recommended and wouldn't return.  I gave the extra star because our server was nice and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Cecilia K.,/user_details?userid=D0AMU8bQOWsA4zo5cJVKZA,"New York, NY",11/10/2017,2.0,"Lasagna is amazing, but the service from on particular waitress is abysmal. I ordered focciccia * to start* with a bottle of wine. Then ordered 2 lasagnas. Everything arrived before the bread. Then I reminded her I ordered focaccia and she brought with out olive oil. I the asked her for the check and to wrap food up to go. And she put both lasagnas in one container and placed it on he table with out a bag. It was hilarious and ridiculous. The food here is amazing but her particular service needs a big adjustment!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
