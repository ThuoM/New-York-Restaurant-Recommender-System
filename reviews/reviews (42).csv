I opted for the bird's nest since the bartender said it tastes the least like alcohol compared to everything else on the whole menu lol. It was pretty good and very sweet, not one of the best drinks I've had but in general I liked how creative the drink menu was! Especially as a Chinese American recognizing a bunch of cultural references in the drink names, and the unique Chinese ingredients that are mixed into the drinks. In terms of food, I liked the truffle mushroom salad the most bc the flavors were on point. Pork belly was okay to me, I felt like the portions were way too small and could have been more tender. Crab fried rice was solid though!"

We order 3 things for the table: the duck salad, vegetable fried rice, and the short ribs. All were amazing and packed with flavor. The kale in the salad is kept crispy, I have no idea how they do that but it's such a great pairing with the duck. The vegetable fried rice may *sound* plain, but it definitely isn't. It's super fragrant and is the perfect carb-y dish to go with any of the mains! The short rib sat on a creamy coconut curry sauce and came with a small side of crispy rice on the plate. The short rib was insanely tender and the meat fell right off the bone. Everything was delicious and this is easily at the top of my favorite Thai spots in the city now.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/wan-wan-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Arlene W.,/user_details?userid=LrLRacy1XKJcWn7TbAKyWA,"Manhattan, NY",12/22/2022,5.0,"When I saw that Erika Chou, owner of Wayla and Kimika, was opening a Thai restaurant, I had to make a reservation! It claims to be ""Old-Phuket style,"" blending local Thai and immigrant Chinese cooking, which resulted in delicious flavors I had never had before. The restaurant has a cozy upscale vibe, with gorgeous art deco chandeliers and velvet pillowed seating. We ordered the marinated spare ribs, duck salad, crab curry noodles, and wagyu thin rice noodles. All the dishes had complex, well-balanced flavors, but were on the smaller portion and pricier side. The crab curry was so rich and tasty, but much spicier than I expected - it was a masochistic experience where I was crying but couldn't stop myself from taking more bites. The coconut rice pudding was a refreshing dessert to finish off the meal.

Very chill vibes and great decor, perfect for brunch with friends. Brunch menu is different than dinner menu so make sure you check before going in case you wanted to try the lobster tomyum noodles or wagyu soup noodles (those are dinner only). The appetizers were really good, especially the duck salad - outstanding. 5/5. The pork belly was pretty good too and taste rather authentic. The massaman curry pot pie was also outstanding - good combo of French/Thai. The nam prik noodles was a meh for me but my friend loved it so either hit or miss. The rice clay pot was probably our least favorite. The rice was too dry and the meat lacked seasoning.

Pork belly is obvs a no-brainer, the fried tofu was coated with almost a mochi-like exterior which was very unique and worked so well, and whoever thought to add crispy kale chips in that duck salad is a genius. The Guay tiew nua (wagyu beef noodle soup) had some of the tenderest slices of beef I've ever had, and the broth was just divine.

Marissa S.,/user_details?userid=-q6PQPt4a-Cws-ePsLRBIQ,"Brooklyn, NY",6/30/2022,4.0,"Enjoyed a meal with a friend here recently, where we sampled a couple small dishes and a noodle dish. The tofu had a sticky/gooey quality to it which was pretty cool, though I think the peanut sauce could have been a little more flavorful or maybe I just needed more of it in general. The ribs were really great, sitting in a delicious sauce, and actually fairly easy to eat, tender and not too many bones. The crispy pork belly was good but I was expecting bigger pieces. On the other hand, the small pieces allowed for more chili sauce to pork belly bite ratio which was worthwhile. Finally we had the noodles with roast chicken, which I was hesitant about since I rarely order chicken dishes at restaurants, but the chicken skin here was so crispy and good, and the rest of the flavors and vegetables in the noodles were quite good together.

When we asked the host if they were supposed to be cold- especially seeing as they came in tin foil and had butter in the side, he sheepishly said no, then returned to apologize and ask if he could offer us something else as there were no more potatoes. We assumed, given the situation that this would be on the house, it was after all a small dish that they brought completely cold and had no more of. So it was surprising to see them still charge us for the replacement item which totaled 12 bucks. I didn't say anything, it just felt like bad style and generally like the place isn't nearly as classy as it tries to appear.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/karasu-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I don't think we'll be back just because of the fairly small menu and the servers were a bit weird to interact with and seemed more focused on up-selling us vs. just being normal/nice. We were running 10 minutes late and they made sure to let us know we only had the table for an hour and a half. This was a completely fine amount of time, but it just felt kind of tacky. I personally don't like to know they are booking the tables that close together - to the point where they have to let you know what time to leave. The ambiance was cool; perfect lighting and noise level (good for a date). I thought the food was really good, so if you're willing to overlook the other things mentioned I'd give them four stars. I had the whole fish, which was amazing IMO - paired with this delicious white wine they had by the glass.

Emily C.,/user_details?userid=TMXpMq7uE40G_ivFCRV5Kw,"Queens, NY",7/8/2019,5.0,"This spot actually has some great curry with plenty of fried options available. The service is really quick and the portions are super filling. I went for the small curry but there was actually a good amount of rice. I added shrimp, pork katsu, chicken katsu and fish katsu on top. The katsu were all pretty thin pieces of meat. The fish in particular was really thin. I preferred the pork and chicken over the fish, which really isn't worth it. The shrimp was also pretty small but covered in plenty of breading. Everything was nice and crispy and the curry was really good too. It wasn't spicy at all. I wish there was just a bit more curry sauce though. I also added pickled radish which is a bit sweet and sour and gave a nice flavor contrast to all the fried items. The cabbage that is provided is also a nice refreshing touch. Definitely an affordable, filling, tasty meal!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/go-go-curry-new-york-33?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

If you like spicy, definitely drizzle some on top of the cutlet and you have an amazing lunch for around $10, which is almost unheard of in FiDi.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/go-go-curry-new-york-33?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
