Inside this low lit parlor level restaurant you'll find a pretty decent bar area in the middle of two designated dining spaces in the back and in the front. The service here is amazing. I love being walked through the menu and getting descriptions down to the flavor profiles extra points on wine pairings and you will definitely experience all of that here. All of the plates are pretty different from one another so it's hard to pin down exactly what the cuisine is. But they focus on seasonality and freshness at the forefront. The muscles in an octopus ink sauce we're not only striking an appearance, but flavor as well- very refreshing. I also really enjoy the beef tongue. It was so tender and remind me a pastrami in the best way. And even though I've had it so many times the fried mushrooms were amazing. The batter was so light and crispy. It was unlike any fried mushrooms I've had before. The most lackluster thing I had was the steak and at that price point skip it and grab some other interesting small plates, instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/place-des-f%C3%AAtes-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friend walked in to put our name on the list for a table, and another party who also walked in was seated before us. It was a bit disorganized. We were seated at the 'drink bar' and the bar stools were uncomfortable. We ordered drinks, and my wine glass was warm. There were no silverware or place settings until after they brought our first course. We ordered all four courses and dessert, and by the end my back was hurting from sitting on the stool and leaning over the bar by the end. However, I can see the potential of this place, the dishes were innovative and I particularly liked the pork collar. The waiters were really nice though.

Shari H.,/user_details?userid=IUwwK-UuatQeXNNTUK6kyQ,"Brooklyn, NY",11/19/2021,3.0,"3.5 is my official score. I came to Bar Camillo on a Monday at 7 without a reservation but I was still able to get a table for 3 in the covered & heated backyard dining. Not all tables get the same heat (or any). The table in the back left had no heat. A little unpleasant at first. I tried the Ginger Spritz it was nice and refreshing but I'll stick with Aperol spritz. For our meal we had the meatballs (polpette di manzo) , the artichokes (Carciofi), baked cacio & pepe and the seasonal pinsa special - all'Uccelletto which had pork sausage, Tuscan kale, cannellini & sage puree, tomatoes and mozzarella. I didn't love the pinsa special. It was lacking flavor and the after taste was chalky - weird for pizza, I know. I think that was due to the cannellini beans. The cacio e pepe was good not as peppery as I like and I was shocked to see that they used gentile pasta and not spaghetti. I'm also not a fan of artichokes BUT this was actually very tasty. I would try them again but different items.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-camillo-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Had never been before and it's a local spot I had walked by before so I wanted to give it a try. We arrived around 8:00 PM without a reservation and were seated within about 15-20 minutes. I thought it might be quiet on a Wednesday, but while we were waiting someone else asked for a table and we realized 3 other couples were waiting after us! We sat in the back which was cute and romantic. It rained heavily during the meal which actually added to the atmosphere since we were protected by the transparent roof! It was warmer in the backyard than the inside which also looked nice but not uncomfortable as they had fans throughout. My partner and I noticed that it seemed like maybe a server called out; there was one guy literally doing everything from hosting to grabbing drinks to serving food etc. He was a champ! Service was still reasonably paced and I just couldn't believe how good this guy was. Despite doing a million things at once I still felt like he provided personal attention and was easy to get a hold of, like when we wanted the check. Pizza was nice and thin and crispy and filling!

I had to call the restaurant 3 times to check on it after they missed the estimated delivery time (that was already 45 mins to an hour - a conservative estimate for the burrito,chips and guac and salad we ordered).

Other then that if you want to try new dishes, we recommend to try out their frog legs. Made with Provençal garlic butter, it was tender and delicate with a mild, and slightly sweet flavor. The garlic butter adds richness and depth, along with a subtle hint of garlic and herbs, enhancing the overall taste experience. Whenever we go to a french restaurant we love ordering the Escargot. It's savory and buttery. The flavor of the snail complements the strong garlic and fresh parsley that it is bathed in. They give you bread to soak up rich garlic and butter sauce. We also ordered the Yellowfin Tuna Tartare. It was a light and flavorful dish, and you get that natural flavor of the fish.

My friend that went here before only did outdoor seating, so he was impressed by the somewhat antique, royalty-like decor around the indoor area. We sat at the bar as we ordered just drinks, and we didn't need to wait when we arrived around 10:30pm (though they have reservations on Resy, which is probably the move if we were to go at a busier dinner hour). We shared the L'Antonieta (which was available according to Instagram, but I didn't see it on the menu unless I was already pretty buzzed and didn't notice) and the Smoky Black Banana, both of which are very pretty in its own style - the L'Antonieta has a more colorful look with a purple lotus root as garnish, while the Smoky Black Banana has a more mature presentation with a salt rim and is quite strong. While the drinks are very pretty, the cocktail mixture wasn't necessarily too ideal - the L'Antonieta had a bit too much sugar so it didn't sit too well in my mouth, but otherwise, I overall enjoyed the drinks the bartender created here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/excuse-my-french-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The chef (who is also the owner) is French and clearly knows what he's doing! I had the beef tartare which was delicious. The meat was so fresh & tender and seasoned to perfection. I also had the Croque Monsieur which was quite simple but so very delicious. The Happy Hour is great - drinks are solid and nice wine options.

The Brussels sprouts were literally incredible -- we got them with the optional lamb sausage, they also had toasted almond slices and pomegranate seeds and were maybe the best brussel sprouts I've ever had anywhere.

When the bill came we inquired about the cost and it was only then that he informed us that those wines were not included. Beyond that, my client ordered the scallops and cauliflower. I didn't notice until the bill arrived that 3 small scallops cost 21. and the cauliflower cost 17. I certainly wasn't going to say anything in front of my client. But this is just ridiculous.

Lisa L.,/user_details?userid=UG8ykTnbXDxcjb65899rVw,"Brooklyn, NY",4/7/2017,2.0,"I discovered this cute little French-ish tapas / wine bar with my boyfriend one day and we thought it would be our next favorite place in LES. Our first dinner there was really nice with good food and drinks, and very decent service. My second visit there, however, is the reason I am giving it--with a heavy heart--only two stars. The reason was the awful bartender that we encountered when I was there with two of my girlfriends. We were sitting at the bar, so that lady was also our de facto server. She exhibited rudeness and bad, unprofessional attitude on several occasions. One example being when my friend asked her is she has a paper bad to pack the leftover food ( we really over-ordered on the tapas by accident). This which she replied, in a visibly annoyed manner: ""I would have to go downstairs to get it."" Since we didn't respond to that, she finally kindly did go and get it, and then proceeded to thrust our food into the bag angrily. We were really doing our best to stick to our conversation. I can really say with clear conscience that neither me nor any of my friends have been rude or not napropriate are any point, or did anything I can think of to deserve such treatment. It truly seemed like that lady was unhappy with being there and having to deal with people. It actually wasn't even busy enough for her to feel underwhelmed, for example. After getting the check, we simply wanted to double-check the price of the wine that we've been drinking, at least half of which was ordered during the 2-for-1 happy hour. The moment we started asking about it, I think that lady assumed we were going to dispute the bill and said: ""You ordered a bunch of stuff after the happy hour!"" In a tone that definitely sounded like anything but polite, not tomenrion that she wasn't even referring to our question. Again, I'm very sad to give this place a low rating, because I think it has loads of potential.  It's very cute, with a quaint, cozy decor and decent food and drinks, on top of a great LES location. But that experience has thrown me of very much and, unfortunately, NYC is such a huge market that I think staff's attitude is indeed a very important factor.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/excuse-my-french-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It is definitely a small wine bar but super cozy. The interior is very cute and the books in the back look very convincing (its just the wallpaper!). The happy hour is from 5-7pm and is a 241 deal for one of their whites, one of their reds and all the royale champagne drinks. I LOVED the red wine they had as the happy hour and my friend enjoyed the rose royale cocktail the best. We opted for the baked camembert that came with apple slices, grapes and a fig jam that was SO delicious. We then ordered the watermelon salad and the sliders.

They graciously accommodated our party of 6. The service was friendly and attentive. Cocktails were creative and delicious. The food was fantastic and portions were the right size to be able to try an interesting variety of foods. The grav lax was the best we've ever had. The foil gras was expertly cooked.

Kirsten C.,/user_details?userid=xIk7FYmE71ANKtHVQG13Lw,"Denver, CO",6/25/2017,3.0,"I wanted to like this place more. We actually got a fabulous table that faced the street. Since it is technically the lower level, it was cool to watch everyone walk by and just be close to the street scene. Very cute, narrow, colorful restaurant. We ordered: Cerignola olives (which were amazing, crisp, and flavorful), steamed whole artichoke (not too bad, but it was small and the meatiness to it was not robust), pan seared yellowtail tuna (good), scallop carpaccio (this was actually terrible - while the consistency tasted fresh, it was actually very fishy tasting/smelling and the olive oil grade was not great as it tasted chalky. I was really disappointed in this), escargot (excellent!), and the duck confit (also pretty good). I think the idea of French tapas is great, but I was expecting better food. Great place to grab a glass of wine, though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/excuse-my-french-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Emily V.,/user_details?userid=IgmjNahS-JiemlYfo7kIHQ,"Manhattan, NY",3/7/2019,3.0,"Came here for dinner last night and left feeling entirely underwhelmed. While the decor is charming and the cocktails were lovely, the waitress was less than polite and the food had a lot of room for improvement. I very much enjoyed the cocktail with creme de violette and was overall impressed with their cocktail menu,  so much so that I might recommend coming here if you're on the slightly adventurous side and looking for a nice cocktail. It was kind of cool to see half of the bar that spanned almost the entire length of the restaurant converted into a kitchen so you can see the chef preparing your food, but I have to say that that is where the fascination ends; perhaps if the chef had more room to work the food would be better. The highly recommended whole cauliflower dish was thoroughly unpleasant. That which sounded on the menu like what would be a lovely combination of spices and looked as if it had a crispy, roasted exterior turned out to be a completely mushy, mustard tasting, but undersalted and otherwise flavorless mess. I will say that my mushroom dish was nice, and came with a delicious alfalfa salad and a wonderful sauce on the bottom. My friend ordered the sliders and the top buns were burnt enough to make a sound when tapped. Overall this restaurant gets a pass for being cute and having nice drinks, but I wouldn't return for the purpose of eating.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/excuse-my-french-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Danesh J.,/user_details?userid=tw7FIwLw8-GqiuqxJ7A2pg,"Bronx, NY",7/26/2016,4.0,"Loved this place. It's downstairs, so you might miss it walking by. The interior was cute, the food was delicious, the service was good, and drinks were interesting. I got the photogenic Hibiscus Champagne with the edible flower, the Butterfly Salmon, and the Watermelon Salad. This was enough to fill me up. The food was great, no complaints there. The salmon was flavorful, moist, and tender and the bed of ratatouille (stewed veggies) that it was on was equally flavorful. The portion was a good size for me, I tend to like smaller portions or sizes that leave me feeling content. This is a tapas place, so the portions will be smaller. The drink looked great, it was a bit sweet so be warned. It was on their happy hour, so I also got to try their Lavender version. They have a few options to choose from and the cool thing is they extract the essence from the flowers in house. For dessert, I had to get the Nutella Crepe since everything else tasted so good. It was a bit bigger than I expected and would be good to share between two people. It had a nice crunchy texture to it, but had a bit too much nutella for me; you can ask to have less or just press it out before each bite. Overall, this place is great for a couple that wants to share a few items and have a drink or two. The drinks appear the be the only things on their happy hour though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/excuse-my-french-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We have no regrets!!!! From start to finish, this place was perfect. The decor is so personal and chic; a balance of whimsical, antique, and classy. The waiter was quick to attend to us so we were sat very quickly and my seat had a perfect view Int the chef's kitchen, which I must say was a show to watch with his precision and pace. Also, the kitchen was very clean. The menu is small and everything we ate was absolutely fresh and delicious. We had the salmon, tartine, carpaccio, tartare, Brussels sprouts, Cajun chicken, duck confit, soufflé, chocolate croulant (?) and lemon butter crepe. Oh my god. Utter bliss and indulgent and because everything is tapas style, you get the most amount of flavor in every bite. I'm someone who can get bored very quickly of repetitive flavors and textures, everything was new, flavorful and different. Something as simple as the fig and goat cheese tartine had olive oil and something to give it a kick. It was all so exciting! Even when we were only going to order the croulant and soufflé, the owner was adamant and said no, we must try a crepe. So fluffy, light, and thin.

The drinks are tasty and inventive- not your typical ingredients. I love gin and I don't like my cocktails sweet and so they won me over by producing new-to-me gins paired with pine and herb flavors that were almost sour but to me they were crisp and refreshing. I've had drinks with pine in them before but it was way too piney- this was perfectly mixed with just a hint of pine. Next, I'm a Brussel sprout lover and was ecstatic to discover that not only do they not fry them but they seemed lovingly prepared as they were brilliantly colored and roasted to perfection with almond slivers and dried cranberries and drizzled with balsamic reduction. We also had a plate of prosciutto which was a delicious compliment to the Brussels. Finally, Ricardo was a total pleasure to speak with (though fiercely protective of the brussel sprout cooking methods!). Just in case we weren't completely sold on a return visit, he sealed the deal by presenting us with a crepe that was simply to DIE for. And it was their most basic one! I was convinced there was caramel inside but instead was a sort of a caramelized spun sugar. The whole thing was heaven- the crepe was melt in your mouth with the finest butter I'd ever tasted.

E G.,/user_details?userid=-9UvAvhutXGm3DoIR-F1UQ,"Matthews, NC",7/10/2018,5.0,"The two of us had the baked camembert, escargot, duck confit, Cajun chicken, and mandarin souflee. The portion sizes were small, but this is a tapas place, so to be expected. The Cajun chicken was underwhelming with regards to spices, but everything else was delicious. The presentation of the duck confit was unique; the duck was layered with mashed potatoes and truffle puree into the form of a tower. The escargot was served still in its shell, so you know it's fresh, and wonderfully bathed in its garlic parsley butter sauce. The sliced baguette served with our food was perfect for dipping, and its exterior was delightfully crisp while its interior was fresh and fluffy. The baked camembert was like an elevated and much tastier form of fondue and the mandarin souflee was like a classy lighter version of cheesecake. We tried a few of the mixed drinks, and loved them all. We honestly had a wonderful experience here, which was guided by our friendly bartender/waiter and the chef, who worked his magic in a small kitchen that sat besides the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/excuse-my-french-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Potatoes are awesome but it was really the focal point of the dish and after a while I was like...I just don't want anymore of this. A bit of bacon or pancetta would have maybe made up some of this ground? My girlfriend had the waffles with apple. She said the waffles were really good but the smoked apple was kinda weird. Would like to come back and try other things! The only slightly off putting stuff was some of the plants were dying and some of the waitstaff were dressed formally and others were very casual.

Don't get me wrong, atmosphere is chill but food is not great at all. Nachos had what tasted like reheated or recycled burger meat, tomato soap tastes likes Campbell's  burger had no flavor besides the crazy amount of cheese you're throwing on top and the cheez it mozzarella sticks were so weird and bland.

Food is good. My favorite is a Buffalo Cauliflower. It's delicious with a perfect amount of the buffalo sauce! What you can't miss is their doughnuts!!! It comes with 3 sauces; Nutella, caramel, and raspberry which you can inject your choice of sauce directly inside the doughnut. The reason for my 3 stars is the service. Never once I got a good service. They seems to be rude and don't really care much about their customers. Sometime my friend and I decide to skip food and order drink and pay at the bar to avoid the rudeness from the servers.

I approached waitresses to ask and were told we could sit anywhere. The both of waitresses saw us sit down at table close to them but for some reason it took over 10mins for them to approach the table. The restaurant was not very busy at all. We really wanted to just get up and leave because of the service. Only thing that kept me their was the fact that we were starving.  Waitresses looked they were not interested in serving. They were more in entertainined with  conversation between the  both or them. We ordered a couple of burgers that came with frys. The burgers were super tasty and juicy. But the service was horrible even to get check we had to waive down the waitress.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/clinton-hall-fidi-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The location we went to was on Fulton St and just so you know the only parking deck is $15+ and it's hourly. For two hours, it'll run you $22 unfortunately and you're pretty much stuck paying it as there aren't street parking in that area. As soon as you walk in, you'll see a bunch of games and even life size ones too that you could play with which was pretty cool. I tried their donut grilled cheese sandwich and it was so worth all of the calories but then again who's counting! It was sweet and savory at the same time. The tomato soup was so rich, creamy, and the seasonings was perfectly balanced.  With my sandwich, I tried their new ipa that's suppose to replace their original Clinton hall Bronx ipa and loved it. It was a bit floral but after drinking it, it didn't bother me so much. It was so smooth and balanced!

The waitress did not ask how I wanted it cooked so I told her medium rare. It came out well done so right there it's ruined.

The girl behind the bar was extremely rude and the guy who brought out the food hovered and rolled his eyes when we told them they got our orders wrong. All of our orders came out with no cheese, no sauce and we had to get them corrected but received bad customer service for asking, for what we paid for. It seems like no one wants to help you at this place. After we were done eating, the trays remained at the table and no one came to pick them up until probably an hour or so afterwards. I regret coming here because we all had to wait a long time just to be told that no one will serve us. The girl behind the bar is so rude and doesn't listen to your order so the burger is not input correctly, she was ignoring us completely.

When I paid she didn't have change and said it would take a couple of minutes for 40 cents... for the food this place is awesome.  I wanted to try the peanut butter waffles so bad but with only two people that would be impossible.  There were several donuts with cheese ordered and they looked delicious.  There was a weird smell on some soup that would go past me every time and it was nauseating.  Ordered the fondue burger and I definitely recommend it!

Also I have many friends in the restaurant industry and grew up around it. Before heading home we decided to go get a shot to end the night. When we got there they said it was already last call however we  said can we do one shot. The waitress brought out the shots however they were half poured. While we were sitting down we heard the waitress go around to the table next to us and share what would you guys like it's last call? Confused because she told us she wasn't going to serve us however we were quick so it was fine. When the bill came for 3 mini shots it came to $43. We asked out of curiosity why the shots were so expensive and she said snarlingly ""it's the city."" Mind you I have been to clubs, bars, from top dollar to dives and even if a shot was that much, at least it would be a real pour. It was an awful experience and very different from a year ago.

The waitress was always checking in on us making sure we were okay. I ordered an amaretto sour it was good, then we ordered French fries (really good) and donuts. The donuts theme was ""Breaking Bad"". They were called Walter White Meth Donuts. I loved it. We were all very entertained with the overly large games outside.

I made a reservation for 3 people I thought it's a cool place with swings wanted to try it out since I work near by. It was on a Monday when we arrived there we noticed it wasn't really busy but still nobody came up to us so we went up to a girl who we figured works there. She said we have to order inside. When we went inside there was no one at the bar where they told us to order the food. when a girl finally came in she was not taking the order was distracted seemed a bit careless and annoyed that we were there to order and she also recommended us to go across the street to a different restaurant when we asked for drinks options. Also we parked our car at the parking garage near this restaurant because it's hard to find parking there but we ended up walking to Toro Loco on stone street. Where we received a lot better service and food was delicious as well! Never coming back or even recommend this place to anyone.

The environment was amazing, and their outdoor seating is full of life. However the service was just plain sad. I arrived last Friday, was told to seat myself. I sat outside at one of the picnic like tables to order a beer, waited 20 mins for a beer I never received. Finally when my waiter came back around he asked if I was ready to order food and I stated no bc I was still waiting on my beer. He then said he forgot about it.... once I finally got said beer I ordered fried pickles and the sliders. The fried pickles were mushy and not crunch whatsoever, but the sliders were great. They were cooked medium with a nice cheese fondue on them! I ordered another beer while eating and once again it never came. I finished my meal with dry mouth and finally just asked another server to cancel the beer and bring my check.

A coworker ordered the Fondue burger that had a cool concept of the fondue cheese being poured over the entire burger that had fries sticking out of the middle of the sandwich.

Carol L.,/user_details?userid=LKaEiBYGBnB8Df1hUyEnLA,"New York, NY",11/21/2017,3.0,"Been wanting to come try this place for a while now, after watching the Fb video about the hanging doughnut grilled cheese with tomato soup! Recently realized there were two locations and I think I wanted to go to the other one, but I guess another time. So we did just that! We went earlier on in the evening, so there weren't too many people yet. It's really popular it seems, and has ""lawn games"" set up for you to play (life size chess, a small putting green, life size connect four, big jenga, cards, etc). There's a lot of seating, so it's great for groups. I wanted to see the ""beer hall"" ATM area (swipe & pour your own) that had been advertised online too, but they didn't seem to have it when we were there. We got a couple draft beers and ordered the doughnut grilled cheese, buffalo cauliflower & mini sliders to share between the two of us. The presentation of the grilled cheese was so cute!! The grilled cheese itself was just alright, but the tomato soup was actually pretty good. The cauliflower was overly breaded and fried, would've liked it more if they'd just served it as steamed cauliflower with buffalo sauce... The sliders were as expected, and very average. Overall, it's a nice place to chill, food is just alright, probably would come again with a large group looking to drink but nothing else. The life size games are fun though, as is the small putting green (10 ft x 10ft green).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/clinton-hall-fidi-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jenfil M.,/user_details?userid=YBwcAUEwWWi9y5OYlREkxQ,"Queens, Queens, NY",3/18/2019,1.0,"This past weekend was my birthday weekend so my friends and I decided to go to NYC. We came all the way from Minot, North Dakota to NYC because I wanted my Birthday to be memorable and ND is not exacty a memorable place. I had two specific food spots in mind that I wanted to check out. One being Raclette, and the other one Clinton Hall, more specifically, the Fondue Burger. I had seen the both ads on Buzzfeed and I wanted to check both places out! We get there on Saturday March 16 at around 630pm. We asked one of the servers if the service was self-seating or if we had to wait to be seated, I have served before so I know the drill. She tells us that it is self-seating and our server will be right with us. I said, thank you so we sat and waited (there were 4 of us.) Our sever arrives, probably the unfriendliest server I have ever encountered. She din't say hi nor introduced herself. She simply came to the table, placed a few coasters on the table and said, ""what can I get you to drink?"" I asked if they had any green beer for St. Patricks weeked, and she said ""no, is that even a thing, I have never heard of it"" with the bitchiest attitude ever. I kept thinking to myself, you're a server! You should be friendlier! The night went on, she barely checked on us, she seemed bothered every time we asked her for another round of beers, just the worst! We ordered two fondeu burgers and some nachos that they had. The food wasn't bad, but the service was simply terrible. The funniest part is that there is a sign by the door that reads ""friendly service"". I didn't find Meghan friendly at all! The only reason I know her name it's because it was printed on the check. When we were ready to leave, I asked a different server for the check, because Meghan was busy with other tables and we were not her priority. The server tells Meghan we were ready, Meghan drops off the credit card slip, and simply left. No have a good day, no thank you for coming, no have a good weekend, nothing! I was shocked, but me being the good person I am, and having served in the past, still tipped her 20%, almost 30 dollars. Knowing damm well she didn't deserve 5%. Listen Meghan, I'm sure after you read this, you'll know exactly who wrote this. If you were having a bad day, don't take it on us! We did not do anything to you. Be friendly to everyone, especially since most of your income comes from tips.

The brand itself seems to have skyrocketed to franchise fame across New York, which is well deserved and pretty cool to see. I'm less enthusiastic in my recent review due to a few factors: a) slow, inattentive service; b) small burger menu compared to the awesome selection they once had; and c) TERRIBLE efforts to do anything for the gluten-free crowd. There's one cider here (that has been the one cider option for eternity) and none of the food menu is marked with any indicators (though they take the effort to mark the vegetarian options, which is not even an allergy). I asked about several items and still ended up with shrimp tacos that were breaded and fried and thus couldn't eat them. Still a cute hang out spot in the pseudo-outdoors (aka under scaffolding) if you're in lower Manhattan and good for groups (but not gluten intolerant friends).

Phil V.,/user_details?userid=zVdwD0m3YysOexCnLlFtIw,"New York, NY",4/16/2016,1.0,"Yelp should really consider adding an option for it's reviewers to rate a restaurant 0 stars. If that option was a reality, Clinton Hall would without a doubt receive 0 stars after my experience there last night. Where do I begin? Everything started out fine, there were a few heat lamps on when I entered Clinton Hall, however, when the clock struck 8PM, the bus boys were turning the heat lamps off. This was no humid 80 degree night in Manhattan, this was a 45-50 degree night where the customers at Clinton Hall were in dire need of heat lamps that were offered. The time is 8:15PM, this is when all of the fun started. I asked the bus boy if he could please turn on the heat lamp behind us as the woman I was with began shivering while she was eating. The bus boy went to turn on the heat lamp, and another bus boy ran over and whispered, and I quote: ""Dude, don't turn on the heat lamps, they said they wanted everybody to leave early tonight."" Without even explaining to our table why he could not turn on the heat lamp, the bus boy walked away, left us in the dust. Before basically begging the bus boy to turn on the heat lamp behind us, I ordered a burger. The burger had finally come out 5 minutes after said heat lamp incident, shockingly not to my expectations of what a burger should look like. The tomato on my burger legitimately still had the sticker on it (please see the picture below for your reference). Goes to show you that they probably do not wash their vegetables after they receive it from the vendor, or maybe they thought that I'd enjoy the taste of a fresh sticker on my burger. I sent it back and told them to take the burger off of my bill, it's not like there was a bug on my burger, however I had still managed to lose my appetite. We are on waitress number 3 at this point, the time is 8:45 PM. I asked the waitress to turn on the heat lamp and her answer was priceless. ""Yeah....There's a gas leak right now so we can't turn on the heat lamps tonight."" Really, a gas leak? That's the best you could come up with? I responded with, ""where is this said gas leak? Why are we still in this restaurant if there is a gas leak?"" Waitress #3 replied with ""It's inside by a table, sorry about that."" Like a normal human being concerned for my health, I asked ""I'm still not understanding what is coming out of your mouth when you're clearly still using the gas to make people burgers with stickers on it, shouldn't you shut down the restaurant entirely for a gas leak?"" The waitress walked away to tend to another table without answering my question. Were we breathing in gas? What was going on? Nobody knows, except for us, considering we had just overheard the two bus boys blow up their spot. Alright, so now we're on to waitress number 4, the time is 9:30 PM. I ordered my third Makers Mark Old Fashioned, the waitress wanders off for 10 minutes, and comes back saying, ""Sorry sir we don't have Makers Mark, you can have Jack Daniels or..."" I stopped her mid sentence and said, ""I literally just had two Makers Mark Old Fashioneds within the last 2 hours. The waitress said ""Oh! You did?"" No, I'm lying. The waitress comes back another 10 minutes later with my Old Fashioned, which I should have received minutes prior. The staffs idea of having its customers leave early really worked, we could not bare shivering while trying to have a conversation any longer. Furthermore, I asked for the check. Waitress #5 comes now, and states ""The bartender added a few things to the check and she's just taking them off now."" As a joke, I stated ""Yeah, take off as much as you can!"" Waitress #5 runs back, stating ""I WOULDN'T PLAY THAT GAME, THE BARTENDER IS REALLY SMART."" What...What does that even mean you psychopath, go home. We received the check, obviously wrong, because at this point why would anything run smoothly. The sticker burger was still on the bill, we were charged for two bourbons that we did not order. I approached the waitress and she stated, ""THE BARTENDER RANG IN THE WRONG DRINK, BUT YOU DRANK IT, SO YOU'RE GOING TO PAY FOR IT."" Is this a joke? I was waiting for the camera crew from MTV's 2004 show Boiling Points to come out and pay me $150 for 150 minutes I had endured without bugging out. This is where I lost it, if I order an item off of your menu, your duty from that point is quite simple, you bring me what I ordered, not something else that you felt like giving me. Being a waiter and bartender myself, I would never say that to a customer. Ever. The tip was included on the check for a party of 5. They even gave themselves 20%, ballsy, right? They refused to take anything off of the bill and at that point I was just so cold and hot at the same time from being so frustrated with the staff here. If Walter White's Crystal Methadonuts included a syringe with a local anesthetic causing me to fall asleep upon arrival then maybe, just maybe you would see me back in here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/clinton-hall-fidi-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The bacon came out buried in BBQ sauce, also not mentioned in the menu. Ordered the burger medium rare and it came out completely pink.

Califlower was deep fried in a BBQ flavored dough ball-crispy-definitely worthy of being shared with friends(which I did though not willingly!).

The place is off the beaten path, but I like that. They call themselves a beer hall which is fun. Big outdoor patio. They have a really huge beer menu and a beer expert behind the bar. I'm not a beer drinker, but am adventurous, so when I saw they had beer cocktails I needed to try one. I had the Beer Shandy, which was a concoction of vodka, beer and other stuff... surprisingly amazing! Will definitely be my drink of choice when I return. My favorite was the food.

The bartender told her to circle what was her and she would only charge her card for what she ordered. Not sure why it was difficult to separate our check or why we received so much attitude.

Jordan B.,/user_details?userid=WvaHuufbonWjsZ3UKUqx7Q,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",3/31/2017,2.0,"Went to the Clinton Hall in the BX on the first day it opened. Pretty cool environment with a ton of hype and right near my apt so I wanted to check it out. Service was slow as I expected on the first day - totally understand. Given the restaurant's presence on social media I was expecting some awesome food - to say I was underwhelmed would be an overstatement. I am a college student and by no means a great chef but I am confident I could prepare an overcooked burger and soggy waffle fries. Given Clinton Hall entering a college market in the BX, where rent is significantly cheaper than Manhattan, maintaining the same prices seems unreasonable to me. Paying 17 dollars for a burger and fries is exorbitant for the BX. Additionally, on the menu the burger was priced at 13 dollars and we got the check it was 17 for the fries, an additional charge we were not made aware of. The reason I actually took to writing this post, something I would never do normally, was because rather than the owner being understanding of the misinformation we were given he insisted on charging us the additional money. I am not saying 4 dollars is going to break the bank, but to put a largely untrained wait staff in that awkward position and not being reasonable in the first hour of operation was not a way to form a loyal bond with friends who live 1 minute away from your new restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/clinton-hall-fidi-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Stephen S.,/user_details?userid=lxXSR5-HJWvUzlC31RNWZQ,"Los Angeles, CA",2/23/2015,5.0,"Hand-down, one of the better beer gardens I've checked out while here in NY. The staff there are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about their beer. I first went there a year ago during NFL playoffs. The general manager (typical skinny mustached beer enthusiast/hipster) recognized I was from Philly, so he turned on one of the TVs to the Eagles game, which I really appreciated. I've probably checked out the placed about once a month since then. The staff slowly get to know you and your taste for beer, recommending stuff and letting you try new products on tap before buying. Great bar food, paired well with the constant rotating beers on tap. They've had a few cool beer events recently. I like the deck area, which has fun bar games (ping pong, jenga, foosball, etc). The crowd seems to be adult professionals who appreciate a good beer while in the Financial District. If you're in the area, check it out. If you're not in the area, take the trip and still check it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/clinton-hall-fidi-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ordered the Bacon Egg burger and asked for just one one bun because I don't like the top bun w/e get over it...especially with a nice egg on top. My burger comes out and looks dry as hell, bacon was burnt to a crisp, the egg was SO overcooked...burger eggs are always runny, this shit looked like a hard boiled egg with a dress on..GROSS! also NO sauce that's supposed to come with it (Clinton Hall sauce) and the bun they decided to discard was THE BOTTOM BUN, like wtf?! So I got a sorry ass dry af burger, with charred bacon, a hard boiled egg on top, no sauce and a bun hat. It looked like they just totally forgot about the order and slapped together the overcooked food, forgot things and sent it out not caring. It's been YEARS since I sent food back but this monstrosity definitely got sent back...oh yah my friend said her wings were gross too. The only saving grace was how friendly and attentive their servers were, they provided good service and were totally cool about me sending back the burger, especially after seeing what I got, they followed up to make sure the 2nd thing I got was good and were very nice the whole time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/clinton-hall-fidi-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Mike K.,/user_details?userid=jmPCxkqEl5c4s5HhCZrpZQ,"Manhattan, NY",6/22/2016,1.0,I stopped in with a large group and figured a beer garden would be a great move. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I waited 15 min for even a look from the bartender. We had to try a table that opened up outside or we were gonna have to leave. Only a little better luck there. They seemed to be terribly short staffed. Every round we had. We were forced to order another one when we were served (to just hope that we would get some type of service with the next round). Only pints (they were out of our first choice on the menu). NO pitchers. I asked the waitress what the problem was and the reply was that there was only one bartender on duty. Can't make it up. We received the bill and were surprised that were getting hit with a 20% gratuity automatically included. It would have been nice to have known that before hand. It's a nice location but needs a manger on duty and another bartender or I don't know how it will stay in business. I hope you have better luck... if you decide to try this place out.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/clinton-hall-fidi-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jason L.,/user_details?userid=Ln1BrNHthhWW7k2l1u992Q,"Rye Brook, NY",8/14/2013,2.0,"Arrived at the end of week three since their open and I was happy with the scene which was quite packed with the after work crowd. The environment is very sociable and relaxed. I assumed many were first timers like myself and occasionally gazed around to check what others were sampling. Nothing stood out except for the bucket of mussles. My friend and I ordered burgers and a krainerwurst to sample. I opted for the cider option to accompany my burger and my friend went with the pilsner. The cider was actually one of the best I have tasted, hense why I ordered two more. Service seems to be much improved from what others have stated but I did notice that there was a self-service area that may leave you guessing. The manger seemed to be on top of the staff to whip them into shape and they were very attentive in the busing and table side services. We both ordered our burgers medium, mine was closer to medium well but the taste and consistancy of the meat made it nothing worth recommending. The sauteed onion topping wasn't bad. The sausage was a completely dissappointing fatty hot dog with a bunch of fries to compensate for the itsy bitsy tiny winy size. Fries on top of fries is what resulted after finishing my burger and questioning the accompanyment of a stand alone pretzel roll. After this, to be slapped with an 80+ dollar bill really felt like an insult. Pricing here needs to be put in check as other establishments are offering better options with happy hour promotions. Shake Shack is a five minute walk away and a decent bar is right next door at Regis Royal and I am not promoting those options but for what it is worth I would have been more content walking over to Shake Shack buying two burgers and a case of cidre and chilling by PJ Clarks at the North Cove.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/clinton-hall-fidi-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Brianna Y.,/user_details?userid=reLf-qZK35KQM3ygB1jhAQ,"Manhattan, NY",7/2/2022,4.0,"The wagyu beef and sauce pairings were delicious - so succulent and juicy. You just want more of each bite. Whether it was the a5 wagyu beef, the American style wagyu or the pork belly, each bite was well thought out and worth savoring. The one reason this didn't merit 5 stars was the service. I mentioned my egg allergy at the start of the meal, and they highlighted the two dishes that could be an issue. They didn't really offer substitutions - just provided me with the dish sans egg. That was fine - until we got to the dessert, which was ice cream. It was one small scoop, and I ate most of it when the telltale tingling and swelling in my throat started. I asked the server if there was egg in the ice cream and she said yes. Suffice it to say, this was not the best way to end the meal. My husband was upset because this was our anniversary dinner, but fortunately, I was able to throw up my most recent bites. The servers expressed very little concern or remorse. And we paid and left. It's fortunate for them that I don't have a more severe allergy (worst is an upset stomach and hives). They had no way of knowing that, but for the amount you're paying and experience they're aiming to give you, you'd think they'd do a little more on the service side of things, especially when they made an error that could have ruined a celebratory evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/shabushabu-mayumon-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We've been wanting to try this place for a while now and I'm so glad we did. So it's a whole course where the chef prepares the meat and food for you and then puts it into your plate so all you have to do is bring it to your mouth. They do it in front of you and you get to watch them swishing the meat into the water. The first piece of rib eye was mouth watering. It melts in your mouth and they cook it at a low temperature so it's not hot when you put it in your mouth but just right. Literally my eyes widened when I had the first piece and I was just craving for more. Every piece was amazing and went above my expectations. They started us off with a cup of sake and then moved into the salmon shiokara which was a little too fermented for my taste and i had 2 pieces of bone in it but after that it was a straight highway of heaven. My favorite piece was the first meat one with the A5 Miyazaki wagyu rib eye and then my second favorite is the washugyu rib eye with the blue cheese, fig sauce, balsamic sauce. This piece was very interesting because the combination worked so well and really left my mouth salivating even afterwards. I left the meal full and so satisfied.

From the delicate presentation of the 'goods' to the single serve bites of Heaven. What a treat to be served every single mouthful of a shabu shabu meal. I would've called it crazy but I am absolutely enjoying myself as I write this review only halfway through the service. The properly measured out temperature of each beef 'bite' is truly a science worth studying which Mayumon clearly has perfected. The in-between dishes of enoki mushrooms, or mozzarella wonton show the creativity and care that has gone into the preparation of this meal, not to mention the flavorful blue cheese and balsamic Wagyu sauce. My favorite 'unique' item being the Wagyu temaki, a rice roll with seaweed and the best beef. Each bite is calculated and balanced. How does one make a bite last longer?

The waitress was very rude and gave incorrect cancellation info compared with what is presented on their website. When we made the reservation via Yelp, there was nothing about full charge for cancellation. We got there late for 18 minutes and we were told if it passed 15 minutes they would not serve any of the appetizers on the menu but we would be charged for the full amounts in a very harsh tone. They also said since we were late, they had the right to charge full and didn't serve at all but they were showing empathy to let us dine in. The truth is I didn't even have any card to hold the reservation, which basically means they couldn't charge me if I cancelled. Also, I checked back their website after dining with them, it was 20 minutes in stead of 15 minutes late that there would be chance they wouldn't serve the appetizers. After 30 minutes, they would charge full for no show. I understand the no show/late policy, but their attitude made me feel I did something extremely wrong and should be punished for it.

Is this how the Williamsburg girls stay so fit? I also got the salad that had savory granola on top which was v weird and soggy. Anyway!

It's great to dine alfresco! This was the first time I tasted a draft Italian lager; I liked it. After checking out the two red by the glass,  my dining companion preferred the Primo Segno. The Negroni was of course wonderful. The complimentary bread was very delicious!  Of the antipasti we ordered,  the delicata squash and the maitake mushroom were both excellent. The little gem lettuce salad was very fresh, albeit with a tad too much dressing. For pasta, the Clam Tonnarelli with thicker noodles and tastier, creamy sauce stood out better than the Smoked aglio olio.  The generous portion of soft gnocchi tasted superb in a sweetish cheesy squash sauce. The  agnolotti del plum of very flavorful ravioli-like mini pouches of braised meat was also rich and yummy. These pastas were all well-made and masterful interpretations of classic Italian favorites.

We already felt quite awkward, when the waiter then bad mouthed us to the chef in Italian right in front of us, not knowing one of us spoke fluent Italian.

Adi M.,/user_details?userid=6R_qVrV8SoghzMzPUxFFOg,"Brooklyn, NY",7/12/2021,5.0,"Came here last night to watch the euro final. I thought the game was gonna be shown in the restaurant but we were mistaken and they were playing it in the back patio. We quickly ordered food in anticipation of watching the second half of the game. We ordered the cucumber salad, the fior di zucca chips, the gnudi, and braised beef agnolotti. Considering the game was on things came out at weird times (we didn't mind we understand the situation and we're actually full and needed a break in between). But everything was presented beautifully and tasted fantastic. I especially loved the agnolotti which reminded me of the Neapolitan pasta alla genovese but reimagined. The gnudi were perfectly made and soo cheesy and pillowy almost like a matza ball with the most delicious sauce! I used the table focaccia to fare la scarpetta with it-- amazing. The cucumber salad was very unique. So delicious I completely forgot to take pictures! I love how everything was authentically Italian but creatively executed. Excellent food, service, and national pride!

We came for the lasagna that had been highly reviewed on social media only to find out the item not listed on the menu. We ordered two other pasta dishes as a substitute and were okay with our choices until we noticed our server taking much better care of the guests seated next to us. Our server was extremely short with us and engaged in as minimal conversation as possible.  He advised the table next to use that the lasagna was not on the menu but very popular - he failed to share this information with us. Our service also failed to bring bread to our table but strangely remember to bring it to the other tables in our section. Our server did not refill our water during our meal and ever brought out additional staff when he brought us the check. The additional staff stood around our table until we had paid our bill. 1 stars because the pasta was good, 0 starts for service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Our appetizer was so good I could have ordered three more. If you love a good meat/cheese play, try the prosciutto salad. The runny cheese served with it was the perfect compliment to an awesome dish. Then our pastas were very nice, also. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly al dente. The lasagna was rich and heavenly although lacking salt, in my opinion. This restaurant deserved at least a four star rating until dessert came. The eggplant mousse was bizarre. I know what you're thinking - that sounds TERRIBLE so why did I order it? Well, I was intrigued. But it really missed the mark and was quite unappealing.

The staff was so warm and lovely, helpful and elegant yet unpretentious. Answered our questions with eagerness and aplomb and suggested a great wine for us. We were blown away.

Stephen S.,/user_details?userid=jkcsmMTnE5Nl-6z5Y428uA,"New York, NY",8/4/2019,5.0,"One of the best meals I've recently had, hands down if talking Italian. Stuffed zucchini flowers were good, but great when paired with the Italian draft beer (birra Antoniana - such a beautiful color too). Hickory smoked spaghetti with olive oil and garlic had beautiful depth and flavor (especially comparing it to my homemade non-smoked version from last night). And the sorbet made from Sicilian citrus took me away to the coast (especially after watching the documentary How to Live to 100 on Amazon Prime). It went amazing with the bubbles of the Italian sparkling water. Perfect destination for a bike ride from Gramercy!!!

The food was beautiful. But what totally ruined this special night was the manager coming over to our table and rudely asking us to leave like we'd been there too long. There were many tables in the restaurant free. She wasn't polite in her conversation. She acted like we ""should've known"" that we needed to go. When I addressed her rudeness she got even more ""stank"" and said that she didn't think she was rude. Her tone and aggressiveness totally ruined our outing for my birthday. I will never go there again based on that treatment. We spent over $200 at the restaurant, and THAT'S the way we're treated in return? No thanks. The customer is always right.

Anthony S.,/user_details?userid=vJKFVNaGO_ZdEapD_c2UUw,"Manhattan, NY",1/16/2021,3.0,Stopped by around 430 for a cocktail - multiple parties seated at tables in the front but met by a tall man with slick hair in a jacket uneager to accommodate us because diner didn't start til 5. After agreeing that a cheese and meat plate was acceptable as the food requirement we were seated under a lovely heat lamp out front. Staff was entirely friendly and kind except for the same tall man we met at the beginning. After first being given our drinks and food the tall man came back to check in - but then refused to acknowledge us for the next 45 minutes - after our glasses sat empty for half an hour and attempting to politely gain his attention we finally were miraculously able to flag him down to order another round. After a bit another of the lovely staff checked in on us and we decided it was probably a good idea  to order another round rather than wait on the tall man again. 10 minutes after receiving our drinks tall man arrives to tell us that our table is reserved for 7pm (it is 6:50) and that there are benches to the side we can sit at (unheated now after dusk in January). No alternative was offered. No other forewarning. We took our full glasses to the benches where we sat drinking and facing a table under heaters that sat empty the entire time we finished our drinks. Avoid the pale man with slick hair and suit coat - how absurdly prudish. Unfortunate that one person can spoil a whole restaurant.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'd highly suggest making a reservation as our walk in attempts had failed. I ended up having the spaghetti aglio e olio and my boyfriend got the linguine al ricci di mare. The portions are really small, so would get an app. If you want bread...you have to pay for it, which is pretty absurd. My pasta itself was fine - a little bland but I did like the hot pepper hints.

Waiter handled the situation terribly. He was so nonchalant, killed the bug, then went about his other tasks. No apology from the waiter or asking if we're okay and wanted to move. No one cared to say anything until I was walking out the door and voiced to the manager the lack of care and consideration for their diners. Indoors or outdoors no one wants to dine with roaches. The manager wanted to normalize this by saying ""nyc is the dirtiest city in America."" That may be true, but I've never dined at a restaurant and had a cockroach crawl across my table. And the waiter not even address it. They offered us free drinks and dessert in the front patio. Still cockroaches were in the front area as well.

John C.,/user_details?userid=jeyrMFfK2lNsqUvKO-Tg3A,"Brooklyn, NY",7/4/2020,4.0,Bought food from the take out shop and have to say it's so much better than the over salted meals they usually dish up there. Not sure what goes on in their head? But like a lot of other New York restaurants they seem to think salt is good - tell my doctor that and it renders it awful. Take out from the store good. Restaurant cooked bad. What happened to the days when you used to have salt and pepper on the table as opposed to some unqualified chef thinking they know what is best for you,https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They have such an amazing menu and the selection of cheese's is always spot on.  I tried things that I would've never tried before thanks to them.  The staff there is always wonderful and if you can get a spot in the backyard its probably the best part of LaRina.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We've tried the mascarpone ravioli and the rigatoni - both were so fresh and delicious. Their pesto trapanese is my new favorite sauce and they have a solid wine selection as well. We tried the La Rina red wine and they sold it at cost.

Douglas F.,/user_details?userid=7npcR5KrubhTxwgYGmpHLA,"New York, NY",3/28/2021,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place. It's a really cute spot and based on reviews I had high expectations. Unfortunately, the best part of the meal was the bread. The octopus starter fell beyond flat. It was incredibly salty and the octopus tasted like it was made days in advance; it was the texture of a pencil eraser.  We shared a few pasta dishes and the only one I'd even consider again was the ""nude"" special pasta. It was the only one out of the three that was palatable honestly. I'm far from a discerning pasta person, but the dishes were so salty that they couldn't even be eaten. It was like the only thing they used to season anything was salt. Onto dessert where the tiramisu was fair -- I've definitely had better. The Italian ""donuts"" were awful. While everything else was overpowered by salt, these chocolate filled donuts had an unidentifiable creme that was light brown and appeared to be chocolate but had zero taste.  In any case, I don't know if it was just a bad night for them, but I likely wouldn't recommended and wouldn't return.  I gave the extra star because our server was nice and attentive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/larina-pastificio-and-vino-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered focciccia * to start* with a bottle of wine. Then ordered 2 lasagnas. Everything arrived before the bread. Then I reminded her I ordered focaccia and she brought with out olive oil. I the asked her for the check and to wrap food up to go. And she put both lasagnas in one container and placed it on he table with out a bag. It was hilarious and ridiculous.
