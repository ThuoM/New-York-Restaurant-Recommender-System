Ryan F.,/user_details?userid=exYSguIUUtRuJf3BJyRBfA,"New York, NY",9/25/2021,4.0,My wife and I are big fans of Middle Eastern cuisine so we were excited to try Salma after walking by recently. We had the eggplant and cheese rolls for appetites and chicken shish and roasted chicken for entrees. Everything was very flavorful and generous portions as well. Staff and owner are very friendly. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. Will be back for the knefe!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salma-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The business partners (Pierre and Debbie) were present and are definitely the hosts with the most. Great guidance on menu items, attentive service and the place is super clean!  Indoor and outdoor option available. Can't say enough good things about this place. Great addition to the neighborhood. I see lines forming soon once the secret gets out!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salma-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Pattie P.,/user_details?userid=O03Ro31Qct-WDAjuM5MwaQ,"New York, NY",9/12/2021,5.0,"The food at Salma is very traditional and the prices are very reasonable. The food is DELICIOUS and this is a new, hidden gem. We went as a table of 7 and let the owner pick all of the food for the whole table, which was such a great decision because we got to try so many different things! So thankful :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salma-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Chik M.,/user_details?userid=-F8Lqn4gzufOn9C_Nhwfhg,"New York, NY",9/17/2021,5.0,"This place has delicious Mediterranean food. We had the mix appetizers and was so fresh and flavorful.  The portions were plentiful for 4. We were full before the entrees came. We also order the mix entree platter and it came with assorted meats. But the kicker was they had baby veal. OMG, it was so tender and mouthwatering. It also came with this garlicky cream in the side. I was full but I couldn't stop eating the garlic cream with the assorted meat. It came with a side of cardamom rice. It was a perfect match. What a great meal. It was all chased down with a mint tea.  When the bill came, we couldn't believe how affordable it was. Definitely go back again. It going to be our go to restaurant for Mediterranean.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salma-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Khaled F.,/user_details?userid=GWVFHMhNf1QZd_EcynFVBg,"Western Addition, San Francisco, CA",6/9/2022,5.0,Amazing customer service. I had ordered food via a delivery service but they never picked it up. I called the restaurant and they told me the food has been ready for an hour and bo one picked it up. The lady I spoke with offered to deliver it to me even though I was 20 mins away from the restaurant and it was around 10pm at night. She did in fact drive over to my location and delivered the food herself even though is it not the restaurant's fault. She went above and beyond to deliver the food and refused to take any money. Aside from all this the food is amazing. I always order food from this restaurant and it is exceptional. Highly recommended.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salma-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
