The room is so spacious and modern, a departure from the other spot that is more rustic. Drinks are very good...we tried a couple of new ones before moving on to classic margs and a mezcal cocktail. We started at the bar which is roomy enough for dining, but took a booth. Guac is so much better here...we like that they serve with fresh tortillas and hot sauce in addition to chips. Crab croquettes were amazing even if one of the 3 sauces was too hot for me! Ceviche plentiful. The duck in tortillas w/spicy tomato cream sauce was delicious.

I ordered a delivery pretty late at night (an hour before they close) cause i got home late from work. Never had this place before but always see it pops up on ubereat so i figure to give it a try. Ordered the chicken mushroom chili wonton and the beef noodle. The beef noodle was good, a solid 3/5 but the wonton is under cook and have this doughy taste. First i thought nothing of it since it's my first time having this place, by the 3rd piece i realize there's no way a thin wonton skin can be this chewy and doughy then that's when i break apart the wonton and inspect it. The dough was definitely under-cook which pretty much mean i had atleast 2.5 under-cook chicken meat wontons. I know i ordered the food kinda late but damn, atleast make sure the food is cook before you clock out.

A little disappointed to see that the LES restaurant didn't have a lot of the entrees on their social media page. I I ordered the crispy croaker rolls instead, its basically fish wrapped in fried bean curd skin. It has a very crispy shell, the fish inside is steamed tender, it almost melts in the tongue. The only thing I dislike is so much oil is used to fry the roll, there was so much oil I could see it dripping. They give a sauce to soak up the oil; which I find in dismay is something like thousand islands sauce, quite thick and tangy, which doesn't help lessen the oily taste of the fried bean curd skin at all.

I'm so sick and tired of random chinese restaurants jumping on the xiaolongbao bandwagon thinking that most Americans or simply non-Shanghai natives won't know the difference.

Nothing special.   It's called dollar hits.   But all the sticks are $1.50.  The selection of the $1.50 sticks is terrible and disgusting.    Fake fish balls and nasty chicken feet and funny looking chicken.   And most of the $1.50 options are one piece or if you are lucky.   You get 2 small pieces.  I can go anywhere else that serves meat on a stick Asian style and for the same price get more than one piece.  Even their meat and noodles combination is terrible.  $11 or $12 for a tiny portion of rice and noodles and two selection of meats.  The portions they give you is small.   Not worth $12 to $14.  I can go to other Filipino places and get much more for $10 to $12.   Like I said.   This place is nothing special.   Dollar hits.  Yeah right.  More like rip off,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dollar-hits-new-york-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

FYI, the bbqs are $1.50. Bill came out to over $40 so I very nicely asked her why since I only had 24 sticks n 2 drinks. She says it's NY, everything is expensive, rent etc.  So naturally I said I have no problem with the price but isn't it false advertisement. She said what she said. 37  years living here and someone tells me what I already know about NY. All I asked is put prices so we can know that Dollar Hits doesn't mean bbqs are Dollar each. The only real dollar was the aluminum tray. All in all, isaw tastes good, turon also. Pork bbq is a bit salty for me.

Manny M.,/user_details?userid=GaVSKuHzhNjYY8Nfve1QBA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/25/2022,3.0,"There's a kind of homey feeling to this place, but for a new restaurant in NYC, it feels pretty ""ghetto"" (sorry that this is not a PC term). That might be good in some ways, but not so much in others. Even though it's been open only five weeks, the place is pretty messy. Tables were only wiped down once, a package of napkins was just sitting on top of the forks, the tables are arranged haphazardly. The food is ok. Nothing too special or different from ""street food"" night you'd find at Seafood City and I can think of better places in NYC to get similar things (such as the Queens Night Market). The fresh lumpia seemed like it had been sitting out for a while. Still, this place and its clientele was 100% Filipino, and the food is very authentic and not prettified in any way, so if you're looking for an honest taste of home (whether that's the Philippines or West Covina), it's great for that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dollar-hits-new-york-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I don't know any other place where I can get my favorite Brazilian food (pão de queijo) and my favorite Korean food (japchae) at the same time. This restaurant is in a hip neighborhood of the East Village, close to Thompkins Square and the 1st Ave L train. My small group ate outside at a table on the sidewalk, which was a bit crowded with people walking by and waiting for a table. But otherwise they have indoor dining and covered tables sectioned off in the street. My fellow vegetarian friend and I got a bunch of things to share, including the pão de queijo and japchae, as well as veggie bimimbap and the tofu steaks with veggies and rice. It was all so tasty and filling! You could add more spicy sauce if you like things hot, or eat it how it comes- mild but no less full of flavor!

Pooja C.,/user_details?userid=Zt2JCPh9On7vAsiwxk1Ozw,"New York, NY",8/30/2018,4.0,"$10 brunch, say whaaaat?! I came here with a Meetup group on Saturday and was surprised the place was relatively empty. I never had Korean food before so I was excited to try it. I got the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi which came with a small bowl of rice. It was really good but not super spicy to me. All brunch entrees also come with a free mimosa so it's a fantastic deal! That being said, if you're looking for traditional brunch items, you won't find that here. It's more lunch than anything else. Also, I'm not sure why they have Brazilian food; I feel like they should just stick to one cuisine. But that being said, I enjoyed my meal here.

Diana P.,/user_details?userid=JF6Dk4Uh-XWgwe1Jg_bUMw,"Queens, NY",7/26/2018,5.0,Very cute wine bar set in quiet part of East  Village. The owner was super nice here. We came here for their $10 brunch special which also comes with free mimosa's! How awesome is that? Their brunch menu isn't your typical brunch food and is more of a Korean grilled lunch kinda food style. We ordered one with pork and one with beef. The main difference between the two styles of cooking was that one mixed all the vegetables together with the meat while the other kept the vegetables separately. Both were great tho and a delight. I appreciate the owner's attentiveness and it seems like he really cares a lot about taking care of his customers and educating them about wine.

The owner is a Brazilian-Korean-American or Korean-Brazilian-American, super nice and knowledgable of wines, all the wines he suggested hit the spot (trust me, I lived in Paris for 3 years!) - he gave us different kinds in between so practically more than 3 bottles. After that much wine (I still remember waitress asking us back, ""another BOTTLE?"") and 4+ main dishes the bill was around $210, which is not bad. Restaurant was supposed to close the door at 12 midnight, then open for us until 1:30 a.m. (Don't expect them to do that all the times though).

Kirsten C.,/user_details?userid=xIk7FYmE71ANKtHVQG13Lw,"Denver, CO",3/24/2018,2.0,"This was not a great restaurant. The only reason it gets two stars is because it was clean and the staff was generally friendly. I had to continually ask for more water. And it was not like the place was crowded - they only had one person working the floor. Our order came out completely backwards. Our entrees came out prior to our appetizers. All of the food was just OK. the bulgogi was very fatty and not even that hot. The chicken wings were not well done and the flavor was...interesting? The spicy ramen was horrible. They used freeze dried shrimp and calamari which is absolutely disgusting. The mussels had a very strong sea flavor - which they should not if they are fresh.

Chelsea A.,/user_details?userid=-cUycLyfb0BqIqyWdFiS_g,"New York, NY",2/25/2018,4.0,"Gomi is a very welcoming, family-run restaurant. The owner, who is also the bartender and chef and dishwasher and server (!) was beyond friendly and hospitable. Gomi is a great place to visit for great wine. My party and I dined here for dinner on a Saturday night. We really enjoyed the seafood pancake, which was perfectly doughy with nice crispy layers. My mom and I shared the Cornish hen (btw takes about 30 minutes), which was plenty for the two of us (with a side) after all of the appetizers we shared. The hen was cooked perfectly, very juicy and tender, I just wish it was a little more seasoned. I didn't eat the chicken wings, but everyone else enjoyed them. I also tried the bulgogi and the Brazilian sirloin - the sirloin was okay, the bulgogi was very tasty and had a lot of flavor. The side of broccolini was delicious and a huge portion. Actually, the portions of all of the dishes were huge and would be great for sharing. I definitely recommend Gomi!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gomi-korean-wine-bar-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They clearly don't know what a pre authorization is. Instead of a $7.10 tip they charge me a $71.00 tip. Since I blasted them online they lied to Amex saying I gave them 71.00 tip on a $39.00 charge. CHECK OUT THEIR PROOF. They couldn't produce my ACTUAL credit card receipt so 'as proof' they gave this random invoice where THEY recorded a $71.00 tip. Liars and frauds.

The patty melt wasn't on the same level of excellence as the smash patty unfortunately. Found it strange that they didn't have either unsweetened iced tea or diet soda for my wife.

When we finally ordered our drinks, we did not get them for another 30 min, and the server never asked if we wanted food. At this point, we also noticed another couple sitting at the bar who also was not getting any service who ultimately decided to get up and leave. When our drinks finally arrived, some of them were spilled on the table without any apology (or napkins) and these are quite expensive ($18) drinks. The draft espresso martini was not good at all. We finished our drinks and by then no one had ever come back to our table. After another 30 min or so, we ultimately had to go find someone who works there and ask them to please bring our check.

We sat down - we waited for a bit for service, which was fine seeing as how packed the place was. I ordered an avocado toast (which was delicious). I would say the only reason I am not giving this 5 stars was the service, I ordered a gin martini (I wasn't in love with any of the specialty cocktails) and the waitress was a bit weird about it. I thought it was just me but my friends all commented that her entire behavior towards us was a bit off the entire time we were there (maybe she was having a rough day or she was just overwhelmed with how many people were in the restaurant).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-spaniard-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Food is solid, although I admittedly only had fries as I worked through a handful of Kona Big Wave's with the boys. Met some lad who was doing coke in the bathroom. I made a joke about him struggling with seasonal allergies (""Yeah I am a bit of an Emergen-C fan myself, my friend in corporate says they're working on a pomegranate flavor."") but then disaster struck when I returned to my group upstairs. As I tried to close out the tab, it occurs to the bar staff that my card is nowhere to be found. They pulled the receipt to confirm the card had been run, so they concluded they gave my card to someone else. I get it, it was an Amex at a West Village bar. I had it coming. Still, the bar staff - particularly the Irish lad - were particularly helpful, and a I got a free drink out of it. I froze my card and was notified the next day that whoever had it in their possession sought to use my credit line to purchase $14 worth of bagels at some touristy Midtown bagel spot. I concluded, based on this evidence, that someone was handed the wrong card and didn't notice. Not a great look for the bar staff as things could have gone much worse. Still. I'd prefer that experience of waiting half an hour just to find out my card is missing at 1:30AM to being anywhere in the East Village. Might come back.

Tyler H.,/user_details?userid=uB8KnJWKZUDYRD2aclAUow,"Newtown, PA",5/2/2021,1.0,"My party of 3 approached the Spaniard to celebrate my friends birthday. We notice that there are 6-7 open tables so we go in to ask if we can have a table for the 3 of us. The hostess asks me if we have a reservation I proceed to tell him no but it I do notice that their are 6-7 available tables and we do not even mind being seated outside in between reservations if they are booked. He responds by stating ""if you do not have time for making a reservation we do not have time to seat you this evening"" then walks away from his little desk in the front. I go outside and tell my friend that I had a negative interaction with the male hostess. She was upset about it so she looked on a resy and saw there was an open table starting right now so she booked it and walked in. They tried to tell us that we could not sit down still because there was a system failure and they overbooked. After back and forth and waiting 15 minutes and no tables arriving the hostess reluctantly seats us at our table. I go to the bathroom and notice an employee went number 2 yelled ""S*** no toilet paper"" and proceeds to walk out without washing his hands. I arrive back at the table to our waiter who is telling us she ""will not be serving us alcohol and only will serve us food"" We had 2 beers each at the bar across the street and have the receipts to prove it so we were not intoxicated. We let the hostess know ahead of time that we wanted to grab a few drinks to celebrate. My assumption is the hostess got mad that we got a table and told the waitress not to allow of beverages and see what happens. Anyway we kindly ask for a manager the manager comes over. Tells us we are not welcome here and we need to leave did not hear us out at all continues to comment on my fiancee's ""lower cut shirt"" and as we are leaving says ""hope that looks does not bring you any trouble tonight"". He continues to say we cannot serve customers who are unwelcome I continue to ask if we appear too intoxicated to him he diverts the questioning and continues to state that we cannot be served. I asked him to please take a look at us we all stood up did a twirl stood on one leg the whole nine yards of sobriety testing and his comment was (In a completely outdoor table on the sidewalk) well you guys are too drunk to remember to put on your mask before you stand up and continues to belittle not only my friend on her birthday but my fiancee too. We ask again kindly that we just get one drink its for her birthday and it was her favorite bar in the city. all she wanted a drink at the Spaniard. The manager continues to say ""I do not give a fuck why you are here I do not care who you are you are going to leave because you are not welcome here.

We talked about how bad this place was for the rest of the day. The food over priced but not terrible. Burger was super average maybe even below average. My friend paid $15 for avocado toast which was literally 1 small piece of toast with avocado on it. Another friend was charged $4 to substitute the ham on her eggs Benedict with avocado (she is vegetarian). Meaning they took the most expensive ingredient out, replaced it with a cheaper one, and charged 4 extra dollars ! SMH. Also the service was terrible. Had to flag the waitress down to order more drinks, took forever to get them once ordered, but then when her shift was ending she kept coming over to rush us out. I would happily pay the prices for quality food, service drinks etc. But this was deff not that.

John D.,/user_details?userid=Jp1rIvZ1K46hTyHusu0ksg,"New York, NY",11/24/2019,4.0,"Went here for my gf's friend's birthday dinner. Its more of a bar than restaurant and gets packed on weekend nights. In fact, on the side we were on, I think we were the only ones ordering food. I think i would suggest somehow separating the tables more from the people at the bar because it just gets so packed, folks kept putting their dirty glasses on our table.  However, aside from that, the food and service was excellent. First a word on the service-I was pleasantly surprised at how friendly everyone on the staff was.  When places like this get really crowded, sometimes the staff can take their frustrations out on the customer when they need to get by etc. Here, just the opposite. Everyone was very courteous. Props to management for that.   As far as the food,  the burger is on the top burgers in NYC list and my gf and I have been gradually checking them all out.  The Spaniard's ""Smash Burger"" deserves to be on the list.  Its sort of like a fast food style burger but more gourmet. We also enjoyed the drinks and sides we had as well. I had the Penicillin and it had a nice kick to it.   So really not a bad word to say and nothing wrong with being crowded-it means you're a popular spot.  I guess the best compromise would be to go, order a drink at the bar (instead of sitting in a booth) and get the burger.

On our last evening in NYC, my husband and I wanted to go out for drinks & dinner. This place was nearby that other place where we played pool plus it had a pretty good reviews on Yelp. Well, what can I say? Very nice atmosphere, clean place and friendly service. The bartender was amazing (I think his name was Keron). I ordered duck wings with some cocktail the name of which I don't even remember, but it was a good one. My husband ordered a sandwich and a beer (he said it was pretty good for this type of place and for this price). What really amazed me, is that that bartender did everything in his power to satisfy us and he did it not because he should have, but because he wanted to! Look, I got used to eat carrots along with any wings I order at any place, but this place served only celery. I asked Keron if it's possible to order carrots and he said he will take care of it for me. Only later I learned that they don't actually serve carrots. Is not that amazing service? He provided us with an extremely great service and had a cool personality! Oh, btw ... we met this Irish guy whose name was Ronin and they seem to know each other for a while. Those two guys definitely made our evening unforgettable. Thanks guys!
