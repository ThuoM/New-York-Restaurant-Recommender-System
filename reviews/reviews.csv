They have a great atmosphere and fun music. The service was so bad I can't even believe how bad it was.... We got there and it took a very long time to even have someone ask if we wanted drinks but finally we placed a drink order and said we just needed a few more minutes to decide on the food ... we got the drinks after a very long wait and no one came back to take an order.... An hour after catching up with my friends and finishing our drinks we realized we had been there an hour and still no one took our order ( no it was not very busy )  finally we asked someone to send out waiter over and he took the order and we ordered another round of drinks .... Again a very long wait until we had to get up and ask someone if we could get our drinks ..... one of the items ordered were peanut butter and jelly waffles that was supongo have banana cream on it ... when we asked someone the waiter came back and we told him this is missing the banana cream and a few min later they brought extra peanut butter and jelly and just put it on the table and walked away, I am so disappointed because I recommended this place and it definitely did not live up to my expectations...

They had a smoky flavor even though they were fried (flounder) not grilled. I'm not sure how they got the smoky flavor in it but those were tasty. We got guacamole and it comes with tortilla,sweet potato and plantain chips. Guacamole could have been fresher but on a Sunday night in a 24hr restaurant I guess it was made earlier for the brunch service. I had Salmon and purple mashed potatoes as main course. The salmon is fine, I recommend getting it medium rare. The purple mashed potatoes are glutinous so I'd get a side to go with it next time. They have nice sides of yuca fries, sweet potatoes fries , maduros or rice and beans or others for $5 . Get a couple for the table with your mains .My friend got the house Burger with sweet potato fries. They'll bring a caddy of sauces out if you ask . That burger is a lot to eat and a bit messy!. So be warned - you may have to deconstruct it . But my friend finished it and liked it. For drinks we got the Margarita Cubano which is delicious with tamarind puree and tangy salt rim . Get this. My friend had the Hemingway Royal with rum Bacardi and ginger syrup and Cava. He liked it but I thought it was more a Summer drink being light and refreshing. Next round I got Atrevido which is really smoky mezcal with pineapple and strawberry puree. Be warned - it's very smoky so if that's your thing you'll like it. My friend got Guarapita with rum, passion fruit, strawberry and cucumber and this was delightful. Get one. Get Tres Leches cake for dessert in a little glass , it has a nice cinnamon flavor and cream. Ask to sit in the back in a booth if you can. They don't take reservations and it's a popular spot in Chelsea. Staff were really nice and extra good review for the bartender!

They have a little bit of everything on the menu from quesadillas to soups , sandwiches and dinner entrees and also desserts. The service is very fast as well . I ordered a beef empanada as an appetizer and it was extremely delicious. The crust was nice and crispy while the inside was warm and gooey . The ground beef was seasoned well and had a little bit of green olives. It came with a chimichurri flavored sauce . For an entree , I ordered the Lomo Saltado and omg ... the meat was so tender and juicy and the sauce was savory and rich. My only complaint was that the white rice was a little undercooked but I still couldn't stop eating it .

John C.,/user_details?userid=BPc8v3bdJmcM0W8r0cpt8g,"Bronx, NY",7/17/2022,1.0,"Is it so much to ask when you appear at a casual restaurant in NYC,  a diner specifically, that you're greeted, sat, and asked if you want coffee and water? I arrived at Coppelia perhaps 5 minutes prior to my companion. The restaurant was not even 1/4 filled. When I walked in, there was no acknowledgment. I asked if I could sit down, and I was met with the attitude of ""When will your party arrive?"" Huh? It's a diner. Anyhow, the man was leading me towards the rear passing a large booth, I asked if we could sit there, and I was met with more attitude but I was given the privilege nonetheless. My friend finally arrived, and we chatted for a long few minutes before a server appeared with menus, no greeting, and did not offer anything. He came back, and gave my friend a hard time over a very basic order of eggs and bacon? When I ordered coffee, he was almost insulted as he said, ""What kind? We have cafe con leche, latte, cappuccino, espresso, or americano?"" Again, it's a NEW YORK DINER, just bring a mug of freshly brewed hopefully good coffee, ok? Then we waited again before said drinks appeared. The coffee was fine, the food was poor. The chilaquiles were a tasteless homogenized mess, with no differentiation in the flavors and textures. I asked for hot sauce. The food runner brought a fiery green hot concoction that I mistakenly poured over my food, deeming it, inedible. Stupid me, I expected when asking for hot sauce in most restaurants as such, getting Tobasco, or at least be forewarned. I took one bite and I had to blow my nose. If I'd not been on my way to work, I'd of complained but we just paid and left. Was it what we ordered? A bad time to be there? Maybe breakfast isn't their thing? Or they should not be open 24 hours so they can gather their bearings between shifts?

Couple of missed steps with first the waiter arriving a couple of minutes too long after being seeing to start taking an order, then missed bringing a side that was ordered. After that literally waiter had a blind eye to our table we called someone else to acknowledge us to order a second round of drinks. Thinking he will get the hint noo someone else came to ask if we're done and have our plate to go while our waiter is just talking to coworkers at the bar. Waited for dessert and then we just called on a lady who was very helpful and explained what's going on and she was attentive for what was left of our time there. Fix the service!

(They were kind of crispy on the outside and yummy soft on the inside) and sautéed brussels sprouts with a kind of Mexican cheese, grated on top of it, frankly, for $28 I thought it was a steal. It was a really nice size healthy, serving of steak and cooked perfectly. I am pretty picky about medium rare or rare and the waiter made the effort to make sure it was perfect. I had a nice glass of red wine, a large pour for a change! and my dining partner had the Lomo Saltado. No appetizers and we were stuffed.! I could not help noticing the amazing desserts that we're going by and in the dessert case, and I found out they now have their own pastry chef. I have to say they may have had their struggles getting staff at the tail end of the pandemic, but we gave her another chance and I am so glad we did because this will be on my favorites rotation! I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the great looking cocktails and definitely dessert.

The arroz con pollo was very well seasoned and flavorful. We had hot sauce, which was homemade and incredible hot! If you're not a fan of spicy or can only handle a mild amount, I advise caution with the hot sauce.

I wasn't impressed. I was expecting Cuban food but it was nothing like I thought it would be. We shared the mac chicharrón for an app and it tasted like boxed Mac n cheese. I got the camarones Cienfuegos with rice and beans. The rice was extremely hard (nothing like Cuban rice) and the shrimp werent even cleaned out which was gross. The only thing I did enjoy was my capirinah drink. The manager was very welcoming and friendly, but the staff could be a little more attentive. After we got our food they never came back to check on us, but they were also a little busy so I'll assume that's why. This Place is open 24 hours so it's a cool place to go after a night out on the town.

Each time I visit however I am constantly reminded of how shoddy their service is though. You have to ask for anything multiple times and even ask multiple people. It is almost as if their wait staff is just lazy. Even to get the check, it takes them years. This one element of the coppelia experience is just putting off.

Karen K.,/user_details?userid=tVKGCinw-CtOF3WtDg4eTg,"Montreal, Canada",11/7/2019,4.0,"Pretty interesting dishes here, and I'm talking about that Mac & Chicharrón. I'm pretty sure it's not a Cuban dish being that I come from a Cuban family but the flavors blended well. I might not have it again but it's a dish I can say I've tried, well flavored cheese & the chicharrón gave it a smoky flavor in my option. I ended up getting the churrasco dish which came with congris and sweet plantains. Very filling, one serving can probably feed two people. The churrasco was cooked to perfection & was well seasoned. Read some reviews that it was salty, I had gotten the saltiness towards the very end of the strip. The rice was okay, tasted very restaurant and not really 'home'.. more of a box taste. I got crazy and tried two cocktails while I was here on happy hour time ($8). One was the Margarita Cubana which was okay, spicy & thick. Thick because it has tamarindo juice in it and it came as a surprise to try and take that down. Another drink I had which I enjoyed was the Guarapita, this was a better drink! The staff is attentive & friendly, the music was flowing.

My embarrassment was big enough to just not take empanadas and let all the other guess know about it.

Their grilled shrimp for any of their salads are awesome, chicken quesadillas was ok because they used a big piece of grilled chicken breast instead of chopping it up into little pieces, fried calamari/octopus/shrimp was ok and I like octopus the most, the pork sandwich was no good but their Cuban sandwich we got last time was awesome.

Zubaida G.,/user_details?userid=IWfdgHvfcgHZPV2UyHYjnw,"ASTORIA, NY",10/3/2020,1.0,"WOW. This was one of the most underwhelming experiences we've had. I got the lomo saltado and my friend got the arroz con pollo. We both got the freshly squeezed orange juice each and a side of yuca fries. The best thing there was the juice and even that was priced differently on the menu than we were charged (we were charged more). To begin with the atrocity, the rice in the lomo saltado was NOT cooked thoroughly. I felt as if I was chewing on straight grains. The meat was FULLLLL of fat. Every single piece had fat on it. The fries were disgustingly oily (you can see it in the photo) as if it was sitting in old oil until it was time to be served. My friends meal was okay at best but again, the rice was not cooked thoroughly. The entrees are not cheap either. Both dishes were $20 and $23 on their own. It was overall an extremely disappointing and frustrating experience. Please know what you're getting yourself into before going to a place where the food will just be as disappointing as the service.

Over the years I have brought large parties there. But sometimes - and I will admit, rarely--at Coppelia the wait staff needs lessons in human relating. This weekend, a thumb-headed older guy refused to give separate checks to our disparate group of couples. One check for two people, only you do it four times at our table. He refused. I observed that this decision could drive people away, but he persisted, So we ordered...but maybe he had already developed a 'tude toward us. Or he was just a good lawman but a bad waiter--he made at least four mistakes at our table. But he knew how to insist on restaurant ""policy"" This guy was old enough to maybe be an owner, and so I guess he can act badly when he wants to.

I only give it this rating and you may see other reviews similar to this was because of the 20% gratuity that gets added on if you are a party of 6 or more (you can also see it if you look at the pictures of the menu). We came in as a party of 5 and when the check came, they ended up adding that 20% gratuity onto the bill. I don't remember what excuse they said to even have us pay for it but we refused. We sat around figuring out what to do and the server ended up removing the tip from it to avoid the hassle. But why bother give it in the first place? If there was an update with the store, it should've been communicated through the servers and updated on the menu. I hope no one else has to go through this issue if they're just sliding in gratuity without letting their customers know.

The ambience is extremely noisy, good for parties to hangout though. I ordered the Mac and cheese with fried pork, yucca fries and a dulce de leche milkshake. The milkshake came out pretty soon, it was quite good, it had a strong flavor of the dulce se leche. My food came out super slow though, and I was not impressed. The yucca fries were oily and stiff, there were at least some that were hard to chew. The Mac and cheese just tasted like store bought Mac and cheese but with some fried pork skin inside.

Not only did our waiter (named Nelson M.) read my review and subsequently send me a passive aggressive private message here on Yelp - which I find somewhat strange and unprofessional. But I just saw that extra tip was charged to the credit card after we signed and left - which is fraudulent and illegal. The amount they added was low so it's not a ""big deal"". But it's the principle. Not only is Coppelia a business with rude service, but it apparently allows waitstaff to tamper with signed credit card receipts and add extra tip to bills after the customers have left.

So glad we stopped in!  I ordered the chicken la plancha. Sooooo delicious!  Not sure how they make their quinoa but it is so flavorful! Perfect match with the marinated grilled chicken breast and spicy kale. It was so good. I am craving it again the next day. Going to order it to go and engulf it in the privacy of my own home.
