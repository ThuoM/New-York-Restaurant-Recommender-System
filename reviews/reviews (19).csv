While the restaurant was a little loud, the dining area was far enough removed from the bar that it didn't feel overly full. The service was prompt and the whole staff was inviting. I got the Cadillac burger cooked medium. While the burger was good, it was pretty clear that the bun was not up to the task. The bottom portion basically disintegrated because of the juice of the medium cooked patty. A more robust bun, or at the very least toasting the bun, was needed in order to take the burger from good to great.

The frozen rose, while refreshing on a hot day, is way too overpriced at nearly $20 a piece. Don't get the crunchy chicken sandwich, it's a very dry chicken sandwich without condiments, except lettuce, on the burger. The Clarke burger was probably the only thing somewhat worth it's value (because it tasted like an okay cheeseburger). Not even gonna get into the starter. Overall, the value of the dinner pictured here was ~$120. I do not recommend going here. There are so many places in NYC you could go to and get a decent meal for that same value. The service is also exceptional poor. Essentially, you have to find a waiter or order at the bar.

The view is magnificent, the bar was decent. Table service was beyond pandemic S-L-O-W. The food for our party of ten took 1hour and 20 minutes and when it finally got to our table all of the dishes except one were ice COLD, the Brussels sprouts, blistered green beans, burgers, fries all we cold. Clearly the food sat for a long time, inexcusable for an establishment that boasts such quality. This has to be my first negative review, normally I would overlook small issues, but a party of 10 in downtown Manhattan should not be subjected to this level of service. You must do better. After speaking with a manager, we received no satisfaction. Fortunately, Endy Sanchez, another manager, was brought to our table by our server.

Asked for a diet coke, was given a regular coke which I drank a partial amount before realizing it could not possibly be a diet coke.  Looked at the bottle and sure enough, it was a regular coke.  I thought I was going to have a diabetic shock, since I have insulin resistance.  Spoke with someone claiming to be a manager who seemed to want to somehow resolve this.  However, apparently he was insincere, because he said he'd call me, but I never heard back from him.  In addition to the coke debacle, the server forgot the avocado and onion rings I had ordered, and finally brought them over, when i was almost finished.  Also I received a salad with croutons after I clearly ordered it WITHOUT croutons.   I felt like I was in a bad sitcom.  Word of advice, servers need to listen to and respect what the patron orders, because given the wrong food or beverage, could have some very serious consequences for the patron. With so many people having food allergies, or medical issues, this restaurant, and any restaurant for that matter, cannot afford to be careless and negligent with what people order to eat, and then be cavalier about it, because it's no laughing matter.  The so-called manager had an opportunity to step up, and should have made some sort of effort to satisfactorily resolve this, rather than disappear and be totally useless, and ineffectual. I've read many comments and critiques here on yelp, where only some get a weak reply from the owner, who only goes as far as to refer the comment to his marketing team for them to investigate, resulting in more weak replies that don't take the customer's part. This is offensive and insulting.  When eating at this over priced over rated, over hyped up joint, people need to make sure they got what they ordered, even if it means being a nuisance.  It's your health and well being that's at stake, not the server's, not the manager's, or owners health.

The Bar was slammed with office workers & they only had 1 bartender solo on the first long bar. Usually that would mean slow wait times if its busy and understaffed but we saw how fast the bartender was working & customers walking away with drinks. We sat at the bar and were greeted by the host & bartender immediately. The food came out fast! And the Bartender Ray as busy as he was was banging out and taking care of his section, everyone had a drink & he was always attentive. We had a great dinner & i recommend the Aperol Cocktail with Blood Orange- has a slight hint of the Paloma to Margarita Taste which makes it so unique as compared to a regular Aperol Spritz. I love to see bartenders actually measure when putting together a speciality cocktail as it keeps the balance & flavor consistent - and Its always great to see a Bartender keep that consistency even when they are busy.

Used to go to the UES location for burgers so we thought the Brookfield location would be nice on a sunny day. Everything was either cold, tasteless or late. All the fries arrived cold --like bagged potato chips cold. Lobsters on the salad and the seafood platter were inedible -- tasted stale and bland. The dressing on the Caesar Salad was like watered down yogurt -- no taste or flavor. Any deli would make a better salad with a store bought dressing. We mostly had salads and lobster rolls but the two hot dishes we ordered came cold as well. One of our friends asked for a bunless burger due to allergies and that arrived after we all finished our food -- 45 min late.

I'm not exaggerating, I am a Pastry Chef and I attended Johnson & Wales, I rarely write a bad review, but this food was inedible. My husband called to complain, he was hung up on twice, after the third phone call to the restaurant he spoke to the manager who said they would resend our meal, only for them to deliver another hamburger that had a stale bread bun, so stale it was completely hard. The pudding again was a liquid mess. My husband then called back and spoke to a rude hostess and then to the manager again, he had to argue for a refund. He was just short of taking food back to restaurant and confronting the manager. We would never order food from here again.

We opted for indoor seating because of the high humidity. Was seated rather quickly and the wait staff was very friendly and quite attentive. The 2 stars were for the food. Started off with the buffalo wings which were nothing to rave about but how can you go wrong with that. Ceviche was good and flavorful, but the fried calarmari was rubbery, tasteless and just not good. Now for the entrees, one daughter ordered the buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich with garlic fries. The chicken was dried and lukewarm and tasteless and the garlic fries were soggy and cold.  My husband and daughter's boyfriend had the cadillac burger with sweet potato fries. I ordered the regular burger with sweet potato fries and all the burgers came out lukewarm and all the fries were lukewarm as well. I complained about the fries and the waiter happily took it back into the kitchen and bought out fries that were hot but looked like it was refried til it looked burnt. The garlic fries came back still soggy and more oilly looking.  We were so hungry because of the long wait for our food to arrive that my husband and daughter's boyfriend did not bother complaining about their burgers. My other daughter ordered the fish and chips and her food was the only thing that was decent including the regular fries which were hot and crunchy unlike  ours. Decided to skip dessert since practically everything we had was not good and did not want to waste time or money.

Don't get me wrong they're not bad burgers but I'd rather get the same burger somewhere else for less money. Their frose is tasty but no where near worth the $20 especially when the waitress takes it off the table before you finish (like wtf?). The waiters are particular sneaky about adding the extra condiments to your meals that make your check add up. I wanted a classic burger and she tried throwing in all these extra condiments knowing what I ordered was specific. They're not worried about service but more about how big the check ends up being. Also odd side note: a waiter was picking coins out of the coin fountain where we were sitting.

The first time I came was after visiting Brookfield Place, I got a table outside. My friend wanted to order something off the Specials menu but they were sold out. He then proceeded to order another dish and it was sold out again...SERIOUSLY?! I ordered the Japanese style lobster roll, but when my order came it was another lobster roll. I hate to complain (bc I don't want any spit in my food) and just ate the bland lobster roll. It was not good at all. My friend got some duck & pasta dish, he said it was alright. I came here again on July 4th, and decided to only get drinks. I asked the bartender for the cocktail menu & he handed it to me and added that the Sangria was the drink special of the day & he highly recommends it. Nothing on the menu really stood out so we went with the sangria...big mistake! It tasted awful! It didn't even taste like sangria & 2 glasses set us back $38 after tip. We asked the bartender if we could take the drinks to the seated area and he said yes, we just cannot go outside the restaurant property with the drinks. The seated area was rather empty so we walked to one of the empty tables (one out of 30 that were empty) and attempted to sit down. A Hispanic busboy runs over like we committed a crime & told us we MUST checkin with the hostess. We asked if he could just tell her and he said NO! We walk over to the hostess and ask if we could just sit down and finish our drinks and she said I needed to put my name on the wait list if I wanted to sit outside.

Service was non-existent!!  It took 15-20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, 5-10 additional minutes to get the menu we were promised and 15-20 more minutes to get our drinks, which is pretty ridiculous (where's Jon Taffer)!! I considered leaving but my girlfriend talked me into staying.  Once someone did attend to us, we received food and drinks seamlessly, thank you Lady!! My girlfriend and I arrived for lunch and ordered the beet/goat cheese salad app (which was really good), the crab cake dinner, so we could have one crab cake a piece and they were delicious, the tuna tacos were good but they were teeny tiny (bit size, a little bigger than a thumb tack, not much) and you only get 4 of them and they are laid on a couple of creative lime wedges for $18!! We ordered their onion rings and they came to us soggy and greasy. Lady apologized and put in another order for us, this time the manager brought it over and not only were they extra soggy and greasy, this time they were on the darker side.  I wondered if they put our previous order back in the fryer and tried to pass it as crispy because they were darker in color.  Manager apologized and said they were very busy and the fryer may not be hot enough (of course it wasn't).  We decided to order something else, which was the mini burger sampler and that was really good.  Drinks and food are really overpriced so get ready to put a BIG dent in your wallet/purse.  I would only visit again because the view is too hard to pass up on, but even then, maybe we will sit in the public area and bring our own lunch next time!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/p-j-clarkes-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jen B.,/user_details?userid=lRoaOeSWI1Jk4vs7euEZTg,"New York, NY",8/22/2018,2.0,"This was a very average restaurant experience. I sat outside by the water which was nice. My boyfriend got the shrimp cocktail, which we expected to come with more than 5 shrimps for the price, but the taste was good. I got the fluke ceviche which was really refreshing and flavorful, but it didn't come with bread or crackers, which I thought was weird. I ultimately asked for some bread to eat with it. For the main course, I ate the swordfish which was full of nice greek flavor. However, my boyfriend ordered the brick pressed chicken which was horrible. The chicken was not ""pressed"" at all, it was barely crispy and the skin was light. The potatoes were crunchy raw. When we brought this up to our server he was very apologetic and gave us a complimentary dessert, but never even brought out cooked potatoes. We also ordered a side of crispy brussels sprouts.. they were not crispy at all. They were actually too hard to eat. We heard another table send them back twice to get crunchier and even still they were not crunchy. We also got comped the sprouts because they came out 15 mins after the food. For dessert we ordered the chocolate mousse cake which was just fine, the best part was the espresso whipped cream on top and the ganache covering the cake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/p-j-clarkes-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Emilio S.,/user_details?userid=yB0KkuYUy2V58BA4pCKF3Q,"Manhattan, NY",7/8/2018,5.0,"Crazy that anyone wouldn't enjoy this place. PJ Clarke's as a whole is a fantastic restaurant with wonderful American flare, and is a true New York staple. The Vesey location however is phenomenal; with a clear view of the Statue of Liberty and overlooking the yacht filled Hudson River. Everything from the burgers, steaks, lobster rolls, oysters, and everything else is delicious and well presented. That mixed in with the ambiance makes it for more than just a dining experience. The service we had was spectacular.. Kristen was so attentive and personable and really added to our night. There was no rush to just turn over the table for the next guests as we got to enjoy a beautiful sunset while taking our time with all the great food and drinks we ordered with a monstrous chocolate cake and ice cream to top off a great night of food and family. We come here every year with friends and family from out of town mainly in the summer. We live in midtown, and was shopping uptown and decided to jump in a cab and head down there vs just going to one of the many great spots in our neighborhood because of how great of an overall experience it is, especially when the weather is so good. If you don't have a reservation, you will have to wait 40 minutes to an hour for a table outside, but totally worth the wait, plus it's a great scene in that revamped area now with the shopping centers and views.

It was really cold and windy yet the staff kept coming in and out of the door right by where we were sitting. Each time it was so windy I would pick my napkin up off the floor. Staff saw but kept coming in and out the door. Food was ok but prices expensive for a burger without fries. My Guinness tasted flat. Our plates did not get picked up in a timely manor because the staff was busy taking manual inventory of the alcohol. This is 2016 and there is automation.

The interior itself is very cozy. As I was being seated ,I asked for a tall table by the window and the host pointed me to one. As my friend and I sat there we realized that the area by our table was quickly becoming a stroller parking lot. We were surrounded by everyone's stoller and things quickly went downhill from there. The host should have warned us that where we sat is a spot for strollers and people chatting-and not a good place to sit or at least asked us if we wanted to move when he saw the situation. He surely had enough time to chat and laugh with his co-workers but no time to pay attention to guests. Now the waitress, no smile ,not welcoming. Took our order and went missing the entire time. I couldn't get another drink and had to wait forever for the check. Now the food- the burger was okay, average. The french fries were average as well, the onion rings were extremely oily. When you pay $22 dollars for some burger and fries ,you expect a bit of a better service and food.

The brussel sprouts came out and werent shaved, but cut in half extremely greasy and undercooked. The prosecco came and it was so flat we thought they brought us wine by accident.

I had family in town this past weekend and we went to the location downtown near Brookfield place. We all ordered water, and one Diet Coke, burgers (which I think are the cheapest on the menu) and split fries, and our waitress looked very unhappy about how small our bill was going to be. Granted I understand that a place like this you expect to make big tips, but regardless as a waitress you should treat every customer the same and still work for those tips. I think she thought we were all tourists and decided to never check on our table unless we flagged her down to get something. Maybe she thought she had nothing to lose by not serving us, but what she didn't know is that I live here and have told every person about this experience. Read on it only gets worse. 40 mins later we still didn't get our food, so I asked her and she said she would ""check"", we noticed that other tables that got there after us had been getting their food already so that had us concerned (mind you they were NOT busy this night). She finally returned and said, ""there was a disaster in the kitchen, so sorry guys."" So we gave her a few more mins then ANOTHER table next to us got their food and had gotten there at least 20 mins after us. We had been contemplating just getting up and leaving if we didn't get our food but once that happened we decided F it this is ridiculous! We thought about leaving money for the DC but decided that it was utterly ridiculous to be treated the way we were. She saw us get up and said, ""sorry guys"" with a stupid little smirk on her face like she got her way. I'm still appalled at this experience.
