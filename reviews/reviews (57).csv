Jessica L.,/user_details?userid=5Jyj4eHRlZHtyEWEgT764A,"New York, NY",4/7/2023,3.0,Came here for dinner Friday night. Cute place with interesting painting on the wall. The escargot and tuna was good. Our entree of the beef and the surf and turf was not enough for two people. Me and my friend ordered more. The staff was super friendly. So we ordered another appetizer and entree. The octopus and shrimp entree with the foie gras appetizer. We still think the appetizers were the best part of the dinner. The entrees were disappointing. The lava cake dessert was more like a chocolate bread with tiny bit of chocolate inside. The music was a bit loud and it felt like we were in a club. Hard to hear each other. The surf and turf the scallops were warm but the pork belly on it was cold. The size of the octopus in the entree was tiny compare to the salad. Would come back for the appetizers but not the entrees.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/l%C4%93na-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However last time I went there with my friend - 2 weeks ago..I had the worst experience with the bartender. My friend and I enjoyed our first round of drinks and asked for a second, the bartender (I forget his name now, but he had dreadlocks) makes my friend their drink. 10 min later I ask for my drink, he gets angry and throws out my friends drink because I couldn't tell he was busy. I shouldn't have to wait an additional 10 minutes after my friends drink was made to have my drink and by no way should a bartender take your drink and throw it out. Even if they are having a bad day this is unacceptable. Luckily one of the other staff members calmed down the situation- also why I am leaving a 2 star review vs something less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/l%C4%93na-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The snail was kind of ordinary(I would go for another app). For entree, we ordered the boeuf  bourguinon and roasted octopus. Beef was tender and marinated with red wine sauce along with light veggies. Corn octopus was light and chewy. Loved the combination with corn and olive oil.

Lena could just as easily be nestled amidst similar cobblestoned Parisian streets and you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference. The inviting staff (Sebastian) treated us as if famille- the scene developed into the care free and easy summer evenings of our youth, watching the staff (and a few patrons) take turns playing catch with a Yankees apparel adorned boy, just barely 5 years old, while his mother sipped wine and enjoyed the evening. Glasses of 2015 Bordeaux came and went, as did the warm glazed rosemary roasted Brie and a light-as-air creme brûlée. The stressed days of COVID, vaccines, and travel restrictions seemed like years behind us as we traveled, if only for a couple hours, to another time and place altogether.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/l%C4%93na-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There seemed to only be two people working the whole restaurant doubling as host and waiters, and it just was too much. I had a reservation and they almost didn't seat us, saying they were full, but they finally gave us a table. We then put in an appetizer and drinks, which was fine. When we ordered our main courses, we sat waiting for almost 2 hours. We tried to flag down a waiter to ask to check on our food, but it took them far too long to check on us. When they did, they told us they forgot to put our food in. They gave us one free round of drinks, but I really think we should've gotten a discount or anything because we were there for so long and hungry.

We got the 4 item cheese/charcuterie board,( with French Brie, truffle tremor, Serrano ham and chorizo), the Savoyard flambée, escargot appetizer, and chocolate cake for dessert. The board was a huge portion size, with generous amount of meats and cheese. The Brie paired with the honey was a match made in heaven! The Savoyard flambée was also delicious. The cheese melted in your mouth but the flat bread maintained its crispy crunch. The escargot came out piping hot and delicious. Surprisingly, it had a more parsley/lemony taste that was amazingly fresh and savory. Lastly, the chocolate cake was rich and decadent (but not too sweet) and was the perfect end to our meal.

The food was quite good. I had the meatballs with a side of Brussels sprouts, my friend had the duck confit, my husband had the pork, and all of it was tasty. My husband also ordered escargot as an appetizer and had trouble getting one of the snails out of the shell - so they brought him another whole round on top of what he ate. That was really above and beyond. The wine and cocktail menu is very decent and they even had something non-alcoholic for me and didn't make me feel like a jerk for not drinking.

They have a great atmosphere and fun music. The service was so bad I can't even believe how bad it was.... We got there and it took a very long time to even have someone ask if we wanted drinks but finally we placed a drink order and said we just needed a few more minutes to decide on the food ... we got the drinks after a very long wait and no one came back to take an order.... An hour after catching up with my friends and finishing our drinks we realized we had been there an hour and still no one took our order ( no it was not very busy )  finally we asked someone to send out waiter over and he took the order and we ordered another round of drinks .... Again a very long wait until we had to get up and ask someone if we could get our drinks ..... one of the items ordered were peanut butter and jelly waffles that was supongo have banana cream on it ... when we asked someone the waiter came back and we told him this is missing the banana cream and a few min later they brought extra peanut butter and jelly and just put it on the table and walked away, I am so disappointed because I recommended this place and it definitely did not live up to my expectations... I can't say the service was ever superb but it was never this bad I have to be honest I don't think I will be going back again any time soon",https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Susan R.,/user_details?userid=yYtDRF62nwvJFZX-O2Ha5g,"New York, NY",10/3/2022,5.0,"Get the Fish tacos and some Tres Leches cake! Those tacos appetizer were delicious. They had a smoky flavor even though they were fried (flounder) not grilled. I'm not sure how they got the smoky flavor in it but those were tasty. We got guacamole and it comes with tortilla,sweet potato and plantain chips. Guacamole could have been fresher but on a Sunday night in a 24hr restaurant I guess it was made earlier for the brunch service. I had Salmon and purple mashed potatoes as main course. The salmon is fine, I recommend getting it medium rare. The purple mashed potatoes are glutinous so I'd get a side to go with it next time. They have nice sides of yuca fries, sweet potatoes fries , maduros or rice and beans or others for $5 . Get a couple for the table with your mains .My friend got the house Burger with sweet potato fries. They'll bring a caddy of sauces out if you ask . That burger is a lot to eat and a bit messy!. So be warned - you may have to deconstruct it . But my friend finished it and liked it. For drinks we got the Margarita Cubano which is delicious with tamarind puree and tangy salt rim . Get this. My friend had the Hemingway Royal with rum Bacardi and ginger syrup and Cava. He liked it but I thought it was more a Summer drink being light and refreshing. Next round I got Atrevido which is really smoky mezcal with pineapple and strawberry puree. Be warned - it's very smoky so if that's your thing you'll like it. My friend got Guarapita with rum, passion fruit, strawberry and cucumber and this was delightful. Get one. Get Tres Leches cake for dessert in a little glass , it has a nice cinnamon flavor and cream. Ask to sit in the back in a booth if you can. They don't take reservations and it's a popular spot in Chelsea. Staff were really nice and extra good review for the bartender!

Perfect for before or after the club since most kitchens close at 10pm. The menu is filled with Cuban and other Latin style dishes . They also have a 24 hour breakfast menu . They have a little bit of everything on the menu from quesadillas to soups , sandwiches and dinner entrees and also desserts. The service is very fast as well . I ordered a beef empanada as an appetizer and it was extremely delicious. The crust was nice and crispy while the inside was warm and gooey . The ground beef was seasoned well and had a little bit of green olives. It came with a chimichurri flavored sauce . For an entree , I ordered the Lomo Saltado and omg ... the meat was so tender and juicy and the sauce was savory and rich. My only complaint was that the white rice was a little undercooked but I still couldn't stop eating it . I definitely recommend trying this place if you're looking for Latin cuisine or if you need a late night pick me up .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

John C.,/user_details?userid=BPc8v3bdJmcM0W8r0cpt8g,"Bronx, NY",7/17/2022,1.0,"Is it so much to ask when you appear at a casual restaurant in NYC,  a diner specifically, that you're greeted, sat, and asked if you want coffee and water? I arrived at Coppelia perhaps 5 minutes prior to my companion. The restaurant was not even 1/4 filled. When I walked in, there was no acknowledgment. I asked if I could sit down, and I was met with the attitude of ""When will your party arrive?"" Huh? It's a diner. Anyhow, the man was leading me towards the rear passing a large booth, I asked if we could sit there, and I was met with more attitude but I was given the privilege nonetheless. My friend finally arrived, and we chatted for a long few minutes before a server appeared with menus, no greeting, and did not offer anything. He came back, and gave my friend a hard time over a very basic order of eggs and bacon? When I ordered coffee, he was almost insulted as he said, ""What kind? We have cafe con leche, latte, cappuccino, espresso, or americano?"" Again, it's a NEW YORK DINER, just bring a mug of freshly brewed hopefully good coffee, ok? Then we waited again before said drinks appeared. The coffee was fine, the food was poor. The chilaquiles were a tasteless homogenized mess, with no differentiation in the flavors and textures. I asked for hot sauce. The food runner brought a fiery green hot concoction that I mistakenly poured over my food, deeming it, inedible. Stupid me, I expected when asking for hot sauce in most restaurants as such, getting Tobasco, or at least be forewarned. I took one bite and I had to blow my nose. If I'd not been on my way to work, I'd of complained but we just paid and left. Was it what we ordered? A bad time to be there? Maybe breakfast isn't their thing? Or they should not be open 24 hours so they can gather their bearings between shifts?

Felice C.,/user_details?userid=KG786v1fNNo9dsR6lWp4uA,"Pompano Beach, FL",11/17/2022,5.0,"I had such an excellent meal here and so did my dining partner. I had skirt steak, and it was perfectly cooked. Served with a mixture of black beans and rice, perfectly cooked plantains. (They were kind of crispy on the outside and yummy soft on the inside) and sautéed brussels sprouts with a kind of Mexican cheese, grated on top of it, frankly, for $28 I thought it was a steal. It was a really nice size healthy, serving of steak and cooked perfectly. I am pretty picky about medium rare or rare and the waiter made the effort to make sure it was perfect. I had a nice glass of red wine, a large pour for a change! and my dining partner had the Lomo Saltado. No appetizers and we were stuffed.! I could not help noticing the amazing desserts that we're going by and in the dessert case, and I found out they now have their own pastry chef. I have to say they may have had their struggles getting staff at the tail end of the pandemic, but we gave her another chance and I am so glad we did because this will be on my favorites rotation! I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the great looking cocktails and definitely dessert. Our waiter could not have been nicer, and I complemented the manager on how everything has really come together, and she also was incredibly gracious.

Nalicia S.,/user_details?userid=cf8ZLZPvxG7JeHvRuJEuzQ,"Jamaica, Jamaica, NY",6/1/2019,4.0,"Overall, a really great spot for Cuban food! It had a very Mom & Pop feel to it and the staff was very friendly and helpful! There was a bit of a wait to get served but it was around lunch time so it was not a big deal. The frito de mar was amazing and the sauce was so tasty we asked for more. It was a passion fruit sauce that was slightly sweet. The spicy fries were wonderful and well seasoned. The arroz con pollo was very well seasoned and flavorful. We had hot sauce, which was homemade and incredible hot! If you're not a fan of spicy or can only handle a mild amount, I advise caution with the hot sauce. This was a wonderful restaurant that I would definitely revisit if I'm in the area again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I got the camarones Cienfuegos with rice and beans. The rice was extremely hard (nothing like Cuban rice) and the shrimp werent even cleaned out which was gross. The only thing I did enjoy was my capirinah drink. The manager was very welcoming and friendly, but the staff could be a little more attentive. After we got our food they never came back to check on us, but they were also a little busy so I'll assume that's why.

And I still do :) I will be back for sure!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Each time I visit however I am constantly reminded of how shoddy their service is though. You have to ask for anything multiple times and even ask multiple people. It is almost as if their wait staff is just lazy. Even to get the check, it takes them years. This one element of the coppelia experience is just putting off. More recently, their brunch menu, though delicious is just so minuscule in portion for the price! Even the hash de cost ills has 3 bits of meat with triple the quantity of potatoes - and even after that, the portion is just too small for the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Brittney H.,/user_details?userid=e7QHK5dE0R6BgtQIoWHQJw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",3/1/2020,4.0,Coppelia was a decent spot. The perk is that it's open 24 hours so it is a good late night spot if you're hungry and in the area. It's not a huge space but big enough for you to feel comfortable. Service was decent. The food was good. There's a good variety of options depending on what you were in the mood for.

Karen K.,/user_details?userid=tVKGCinw-CtOF3WtDg4eTg,"Montreal, Canada",11/7/2019,4.0,"Pretty interesting dishes here, and I'm talking about that Mac & Chicharrón. I'm pretty sure it's not a Cuban dish being that I come from a Cuban family but the flavors blended well. I might not have it again but it's a dish I can say I've tried, well flavored cheese & the chicharrón gave it a smoky flavor in my option. I ended up getting the churrasco dish which came with congris and sweet plantains. Very filling, one serving can probably feed two people. The churrasco was cooked to perfection & was well seasoned. Read some reviews that it was salty, I had gotten the saltiness towards the very end of the strip. The rice was okay, tasted very restaurant and not really 'home'.. more of a box taste. I got crazy and tried two cocktails while I was here on happy hour time ($8). One was the Margarita Cubana which was okay, spicy & thick. Thick because it has tamarindo juice in it and it came as a surprise to try and take that down. Another drink I had which I enjoyed was the Guarapita, this was a better drink! The staff is attentive & friendly, the music was flowing. I'd come back & try the pernil everyone is talking about.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Lucas V.,/user_details?userid=FdcF2g8VuDoLaRFDPRIRAg,"Mountainside, NJ",4/11/2021,4.0,Pretty nice spot here. As a Cuban myself I had high expectations for the place and although it didn't exceed them it it didn't disappoint in the slightest bit. Ordered the huevos rancheros and medianoche sandwich which were both very good. Bread on the medianoche was excellent and the pork was pretty tender and flavorful. Only criticism I have to bestow is the slow service and the ambiance which could use a bit of a renovation. Overall would recommend for a small bite or brunch as this place has it all for those who are fans of Cuban cuisine!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered 40 empanadas my mistake was not just buy one and try it out. The chicken empanadas was sour and taste bad! Just my luck when one of my guess was eating one of the empanadas there was a worm between the chicken. My embarrassment was big enough to just not take empanadas and let all the other guess know about it. If not I would bring the empanadas and make a scene in the restaurant or call the health department. I hate to leave bag reviews in people Bussines specially now in this hard times.

Zubaida G.,/user_details?userid=IWfdgHvfcgHZPV2UyHYjnw,"ASTORIA, NY",10/3/2020,1.0,"WOW. This was one of the most underwhelming experiences we've had. I got the lomo saltado and my friend got the arroz con pollo. We both got the freshly squeezed orange juice each and a side of yuca fries. The best thing there was the juice and even that was priced differently on the menu than we were charged (we were charged more). To begin with the atrocity, the rice in the lomo saltado was NOT cooked thoroughly. I felt as if I was chewing on straight grains. The meat was FULLLLL of fat. Every single piece had fat on it. The fries were disgustingly oily (you can see it in the photo) as if it was sitting in old oil until it was time to be served. My friends meal was okay at best but again, the rice was not cooked thoroughly. The entrees are not cheap either. Both dishes were $20 and $23 on their own. It was overall an extremely disappointing and frustrating experience. Please know what you're getting yourself into before going to a place where the food will just be as disappointing as the service. Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Over the years I have brought large parties there. But sometimes - and I will admit, rarely--at Coppelia the wait staff needs lessons in human relating. This weekend, a thumb-headed older guy refused to give separate checks to our disparate group of couples. One check for two people, only you do it four times at our table. He refused. I observed that this decision could drive people away, but he persisted, So we ordered...but maybe he had already developed a 'tude toward us. Or he was just a good lawman but a bad waiter--he made at least four mistakes at our table. But he knew how to insist on restaurant ""policy"" This guy was old enough to maybe be an owner, and so I guess he can act badly when he wants to.

I only give it this rating and you may see other reviews similar to this was because of the 20% gratuity that gets added on if you are a party of 6 or more (you can also see it if you look at the pictures of the menu). We came in as a party of 5 and when the check came, they ended up adding that 20% gratuity onto the bill. I don't remember what excuse they said to even have us pay for it but we refused. We sat around figuring out what to do and the server ended up removing the tip from it to avoid the hassle. But why bother give it in the first place? If there was an update with the store, it should've been communicated through the servers and updated on the menu. I hope no one else has to go through this issue if they're just sliding in gratuity without letting their customers know.

Be prepared that the place will be packed, even on a weekday evening. I arrived on a Thursday evening, and I had to wait for a seat although I was the only person dining. The ambience is extremely noisy, good for parties to hangout though. I ordered the Mac and cheese with fried pork, yucca fries and a dulce de leche milkshake. The milkshake came out pretty soon, it was quite good, it had a strong flavor of the dulce se leche. My food came out super slow though, and I was not impressed. The yucca fries were oily and stiff, there were at least some that were hard to chew. The Mac and cheese just tasted like store bought Mac and cheese but with some fried pork skin inside. Nothing special, yet all that is surely not diner price.

I made the mistake of ordering a non latin dish on the pre fixe lunch menu and the poached eggs ham and home fries were all sub par. The poached eggs were overly cooked no runnyness at all. The benedicts sauce was cold and clumped up. Biscuit was dense dry and overly heavy. Home fries was probably the item to eat on here but there was a lack of the chimichuri sauce. Average service but was attentive. Good juices though as i had the soursop juice which was fresh.

Not only did our waiter (named Nelson M.) read my review and subsequently send me a passive aggressive private message here on Yelp - which I find somewhat strange and unprofessional. But I just saw that extra tip was charged to the credit card after we signed and left - which is fraudulent and illegal. The amount they added was low so it's not a ""big deal"". But it's the principle. Not only is Coppelia a business with rude service, but it apparently allows waitstaff to tamper with signed credit card receipts and add extra tip to bills after the customers have left.

From the outside, you wouldn't realize that Coppelia also serves food. We were seated right away towards the back. A waitress came to take our drink orders. The drinks are pricey! I have never paid more than $9 for a glass of sangria. Coppelia charges $11 (if I remember correctly). Because I was craving one and the weather was nice, I asked her if they made piña coladas? I assumed that they did since they have a full bar. She asked me if I wanted a frozen one or a regular one? I've always had them frozen... that's what I ordered. The piña colada was good but weak.  Since I don't eat dinner, I ordered 2 items from the starters menu - sweet corn and cheese empanada and macaroni and cheese with pork chicharon. My husband ordered a chicken sandwich and morro rice. The food arrived promptly and everything was DELICIOUS! The only reason that I didn't give Coppelia a 5-Star review is because of the price of my drink - $12 + $1 because I asked for it frozen.

This bald, John Malkovich-looking curmudgeon of a old man we had the misfortune as our server was most unwelcoming. He looked absolutely miserable serving us but oddly perked up when addressing his other yuppie, light-skinned clientele. Pernil was outrageously overpriced, when at a quarter of its price at a Dominican/Puerto Rican hole in the wall I've had far better. I'm not some ignoramus comparing McDonalds and gourmet burgers. This pernil was absolutely subpar. Overly vinegared and poorly seasoned. They had the nerve to not even serve the dish with a single slice of cuero-- delicious, hardened pork skin-- but gave me two stale chicharron chips instead. I can't imagine what they're doing with all that precious cuero... gringo fools will probably throw it out, but I bet they keep it for themselves in the kitchen if they know better.

I loved my dish so much that I went back the next day and ordered the same thing. The lomo saltado is to die for! I've had lomo saltado multiple times and I can honestly say this is the best I've tasted. I have to admit I missed the green sauce you get at a Peruvian restaurant, but even without it the dish was AMAZING! It was packed with so much flavor. The lomo came with short rib meat that melted in your mouth, thin fries (a bit on the soggy side), sliced Roma tomatoes, red onions, garlic white rice topped with scallions. My brother ordered the churrasco, a perfectly cooked medium rare skirt steak, melt in mouth, super tender piece of meat topped with chimichurri sauce served with black beans, rice and crispy brussel sprouts. Boyfriend ordered the BLT. Bread had a crisp exterior and soft pillowy bread on the inside. Bacon was cooked to perfection nice and crispy topped with sliced tomatoes and spinach. It usually comes with lettuce, but with the e-coil break they substituted it with spinach. Oh and if you're a lover of spicy stuff and I mean SPICY they have this hot sauce that you can ask on the side that is FIRE . The Gran Paloma margarita was super tasty. If you like passion fruit flavors then this is your alcoholic beverage. Everything we ordered exceeded expectations except the ceviche we ordered as an appetizer. Felt they skimped on the fish and flavor was lacking. Take my advice and order the lomo or churrasco.

Exactly 1 client in the whole place but made me sit at the bar rather than 2 person table/booth. Talked to the manager about the bouncer. He blew me off. Ordered bistek palomilla with cuban toast. No toast served but got billed for it. Bouncer got in my face for ""giving him the eye"". Yes I did give you the eye. Not a welcoming place anymore. No longer best cuban food this side of Miami. In fact I am going to get a flight down to MIA, walk 1 block to the airport cafe and liquor store and get a real bistek palomilla with cuban toast. Then go to a world class club with chill bouncers!

Takia R.,/user_details?userid=Je5wipn2voI7rlgh5yvr7g,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",2/23/2020,5.0,"The first thing that comes to my mind about this review for Coppelia is - the word compassion. When I tell you how nice and compassionate the bouncer was at Coppelia when we came. He allowed myself and my party to wait in the very small vestibule to escape the cold. He could've chosen to be brash and rude. Like my most bouncers are characterized to be but he wasn't. When I told him how appreciative we were about the simple kindness due to the recent incident with Cafeteria- he was not surprised. He offered his apologies FOR ANOTHER establishment. And said ""This isn't the first time he's heard that."" We were seated promptly, given the ice water. All the bells and whistles. The bouncer came back to check on us. I wish I got his name. The food was amazing. I ordered the Cubano and an a Oxtail Empanada. Delicious. The staff - magnificent after braving drunken hoards of people through the night. It was around 5am.

It was as rainy day but the bus boys kept on coming to clear stuff and asking how we were doing. Food was subpar. An enchilada for $19 was meh and that was a house special. Tiny portions. I didn't complain or said anything but this ungrateful waitress feels so entitled. She doesn't know that the tip amounts are ""recommended."" Ended up giving her an extra $1 so I can get the heck out and make her happy. Man, don't understand how this place has good ratings at all.

Brenda B.,/user_details?userid=htbJkLK5LI8kjEfDqY6OSg,"Silver Spring, MD",2/15/2020,1.0,"The food is good here but recently I was absolutely baffled by the service we received. We arrived and were seated without having a server welcome us. We had to flagged down a server to finally place our order. We waited 45 minutes for our drink orders and the restaurant wasn't even full. Once appetizers came out, the server forgot one of the appetizers. No one communicated to us that our original server was clocking out until we noticed no one had come to check up on us or given us our drinks. We flagged another server who then finally stated he would be taking over the other server's shift. The food arrives with one of the orders being cold. Probably because it had been sitting out for so long. Without complaining, we asked if the food could be reheated. After being reheated it was still cold. Once the bill arrives, we notice a discrepancy on the bill. Immediately the server says one moment and calls the deep voice lady manager. We never asked to speak to the manager and the server never asked us what the discrepancy was. The manager had a HORRIBLE presence as she was instantly confrontational and accused us of having bad manners. Her attitude was UNCALLED FOR, OBNOXIOUS, and UNPROFESSIONAL! She stated that we had intentionally waited til the previous server left to complain when we were none the wiser of server schedules. We were in the middle of explaining to her our point of view, when she immediately walked away from us and threw the bill on the table. This uses to be one of our favorite NYC restaurants. So much so, that we recommended it to all of our friends.

It's predominantly a Cuban menu but has some other Latin choices as well like Arepa, Empanada, etc. Always delicious! This time I was eating light because it was late so I went with the Spinach Salad with a balsamic dressing, sweet dry figs, goat cheese, candied pecans(very slightly sweet which was so good with the goat cheese) and I added chicken. Was a nice portion I finished it all. My boyfriend had the ropa veija which is the shredded beef with a side of rice and beans also delicious! I love that they have the menu on the table as the placemat because then you don't have to keep asking the waiter for a menu. This place is usually packed but yesterday we got a seat. Never disappoints. Best part is they are open 24/7 so you can gave their delicious food anytime of the day. Good drink menu too.

We were sat in the back corner which was very loud as it was right by the kitchen and it was also a very small area. I asked the hostess if we could move as another party in a booth left shortly after we sat down. She said we could but then the waiter started yelling at me telling me I couldn't just move.

The menu items I experienced still haunt me, taunting me to come back. So, any occasion I can think of (family visiting, in the mood for Cuban food etc), I make my way over to Coppelia! The most mind-blowing thing I had was the oxtail empanada: juicy, overstuffed oxtail, with a crema fresca/sour cream topping and queso fresco. I believe there were also some pickled onions and/or a green, herbacious sauce, however that cannot be confirmed. We also dabbled in the sweet corn empanadas and an avocado milkshake.

charlene c.,/user_details?userid=oukdO7PaD3LP5h1haCsfpg,"Manhattan, NY",5/16/2017,1.0,If I could give negative star I would. This is mostly for their terrible service. The servers there forgot to attend to us after a long time and after waiting for almost 1 hr brought us the wrong dish. Instead of offering better alternative he suggested we eat what we got or wait another hr we had to walk out. We ask for the manager but had to wait forever for that also. The lack of urgency to make thing right makes this restaurant the most obnoxious rude establishment I have ever encountered in.

The environment was cool. But the service was terrible. Our waitress took 10 minutes to get our appetizer order. We finished the appetizer and then sat waiting another 10 minutes to wait to order the main course. Then she only gave us one drink. Never asked if we were good or wanted more. She was hanging out talking with other waitresses and paid no mind to us. When we were done a bus boy got us a box and cleared our table while we waited another 10+ minutes to get the check. And after seeing us sitting there with no drinks and no food finally comes over and says you guys good? We had to ask for the check. She was absolutely terrible.

Tarneka M.,/user_details?userid=768nAN_EAiJNUX2D6K2SeQ,"New York, NY",5/11/2018,4.0,This is a review for 5-10-18. I came here for breakfast with my son after 8 am This Place looked so familiar. I have been here before lol. It was at night noisy and crowded in the winter. The difference is night and day literally. I orderedhue so rancheros. It had good flavor and texture. The beans were delicious and the sauce exceptional.My son ordered my grilled cheese. He liked it. I also ordered oxtail empanadas because I heard such rave reviews from it on yelp. It was just meh. The execution was poor. All I tasted was the wrapping around it which was very thick. The meat had no flavor. I give it two thumbs down. The americano was ok. All in all it was a nice breakfast.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Jesse L.,/user_details?userid=BkwZSeREUA99W0l2sbhXUQ,"Mount Bethel, PA",7/6/2018,2.0,The food was really good. We had the chicken empanadas and Cuban sandwiches which both tasted amazing. The reason for only 2 stars is because the service was not the best at all. When we sat down she took our drink order and that came out promptly but then after we ordered our appetizers and got them she just left and never took out order for our dinner. We sat there finished our drinks and our appetizer and was there waiting for about 15 20 minutes before she came back and I had to ask her if we can order two Cuban sandwiches. She then was going to other tables getting everybody new drinks and would look at our table with our empty beer bottles and never once offered or asked if we wanted another one so I just continued to drink my water. Then after we were done eating. We were sitting there waiting to try and get a box for our food and another server came over to us and asked if we were okay and I had to ask him for a box while she was at the bar talking and laughing with everyone. After that they cleaned off our table while we were there and I sat there for about another 15 minutes with my card in my hand waiting for her to notice so I can either get the check or ask for it. It's great to see when the staff is having fun at their job and having a good time but the priority isn't having fun it's the customers but it seemed to be the opposite here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My girlfriends mom and sister though it was also a little dark and hard to read the menu, but honestly it didn't bother me. We ordered the quesadilla for an appetizer, and it was very good. It tasted fresh and all of the ingredients worked well together. I had the enchiladas suizas for my main entree, and they were tasty however I bit into a pretty decent sized chicken bone mid enchilada and that kind of ruined it for me. The rice was well cooked and the beans were seasoned well, albeit a little spicy.  My partner had the tallarin verde - I tasted some and I would definitely recommend that! The shrimp were sweet and tender, pasta was fresh and the pesto very bright and creamy. My mother and sister in law had the Ropa Vieja - also very tasty and tender and had a very generous portion.

This place really hit the spot for the whole family.  Really good mix of authentic Cuban dishes and diner favorites.  We all shared the nachos to start.  Great FLAVORS! Added kick was the use of short ribs in the nachos. WOW! My son had their take on French Toast.  Granted he's 8, but he said it's the best French Toast he's ever had! It was flavored with a dulce de leche syrup and on top was fresh berries and bananas.  I had a bite or two of it--- really good! I had a roast pork sandwich, classic!!! Pork was succulent, great dipping sauce that came with it.  My wife and daughter had tacos! Fresh ingredients, good flavors.  I sampled them all.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Walking distance from either A,C,E or 1,2,3 trains make it very easy to find as well!

Both times the people I was dining with had the Ropa Vieja - served with Black beans & rice. Perfection on both occasions ! The appetizers are all fabulous - definitely try the blue corn crusted calamari - served with the most succulent watermelon ketchup. Also - I highly recommend the onion rings - cut razor thin and rolled in a corn meal - insane! If you are with a large table - you need at least 2 orders of each!

The Churrasco wasn't as long as I've seen at other places but was perfect for the both of us as we weren't starving, but we just a bit hungry. The Tres Leches cake was a perfect finisher. The service was just ok though. It started off good, but went downhill. After dropping the food, the waiter never came back to check and see how we were doing. We both work in the restaurant business and could understand him not coming back if the restaurant was busy, but we were one of four tables in the entire restaurant. We didn't need anything else, so we weren't overly annoyed by his absence but what if we did need something? I digress.

Boyyyyy, was that a dumb move! A friend and I decided to check out Coppelia before a show after yelping some delicious restaurants on 14th st. Coppelia was very high in the search results, with great reviews, so we decided to check it out. The menu immediately threw us for a whim. A 24 hour diner throwing down like THIS!?!?!? Where have you been all my life. We came on a Saturday night and sat at the bar (seating wasn't available -- the place was packed). I ordered the grilled chicken, spicy kale and quinoa. My homie ordered the churrasco. OH MY LORDT! I am not over exaggerating when I tell you that this food wanted to have me get up out the barstool and start dancing! It was more than delicious, it was out of this WORLD delicious! I cleaned my plate in record timing. There legit wasn't a drop of food left on it. The portions are huge, too!

Keep in mind there was a table of about 5 white people around the same age as us (23-30 y/o) having a conversation at the same volume and no-one went over to ask them to quiet down. We decided to stay even after that. A member of the staff( short Hispanic man with black button shirt)  came over to our table AGAIN, and told us that customers were complaining and that we needed to quiet down. At this point my patience had expired. I got up to discuss the way we were being treated with him and asked to speak to a manager. He said there is no manager here with a very surly and nasty tone.

The only reason I'm giving three stars instead of more is that their presentation isn't the best (again, they certainly compensate in taste) and my meal companion's side portions were a little small for the price. For example, I ordered two chicken empanadas and my boyfriend ordered a burger with a side of plantain. My empanadas came out in a plastic container (normal), but they were a little deformed. I didn't mind because that led me to believe the shell was home made. My boyfriend had a side of about 5 plantain cubes that were burnt (but somehow still tasty). That made me feel he was a little cheated. However, the server was pretty engaging, and I liked the music/intimate diner vibe (and of course the soccer on the TV's in the background.)

I've been looking forward to this day for months, since last time I was here. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Not stingy with the sauces at all. I ordered a drink called Paloma, and once again I wasn't disappointed. Happy hour price was $7...decent. My mom ordered the steak and eggs to be safe, and a chicharron& guacamole appetizer, and for drink...La Ultima. Steak was cooked medium, just as she asked, but she mostly raved about the Moro rice!! I tasted it, was rather lovely!! I'm Peruvian, and was tempted to try those dishes, but was happy to have gone a bit safer with the Cuban inspired dishes .  The 2nd drink, was like a mimosa with guava...very fresh drink. I liked the chicharron idea, but thought it was odd that it was pork rinds. I'm assuming it's made fresh, because they came warm. Maybe they shld specify that it's pork rinds. I didn't mind, we took a gamble, and strangely, they were pretty damn good. Overall, I think this place is a hidden gem. As we were leaving my mom spied the bartender making a drink in a shaker, taste the drink with a straw, then stirred it again, and he repeated this 2more times. I don't think the drink was for him, and on the off chance that it was a customers drink, they shld b more careful about spreading germs.  I personally loved my whole meal, and I wld come back, thanks to the waiters, the chef, and owner for making such a diverse menu!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There was a crowd of waiters talking and walking around the counter.   I like the menu printed placemat.  It allows you to glance and keep on glancing even after you have made your selection.  I had the Cubano with Yucca Fries.  The Cubano is $7.95 and the Deluxe is + $2.25.  The Deluxe is your sandwich with a choice of chips/fries.  It took a while for the food to come, I see they are a bit laid back here.  There's latin music playing in the background and it truly enhances the whole latino vibe.  My waiter was attentative and even stop by to tell me it wouldn't be much longer for the food to come.  He was friendly and knowledgeable about the food and the menu.   When my food came, it didn't disappoint.  A basket contained my sandwich and fries.  I found this sandwich to be quite formidable in size.   Bread pressed so thin, stuffed with the ham, cheese, shredded pork, pickles and mustard.  At first bite, you get a burst of flavor and that makes you continue to want to eat some more.    The yucca fries are thick and enrobed in a coating that is thick as well.  It has mild flavor, but when dipped in the chipotle ketchup it is outrageously good.  The fries come with 2 dipping sauces.  One was the Chipotle Ketchup and the other a Peruvian spicy sauce with black pepper.  The chipotle ketchup was the winner for  me!  It has the smokey taste of chipotle and a nice spicy kick to it.  You taste the smokiness immediately as you put the ketchup on your tongue.   I kept using my yucca fries to scoop up ketchup and drop into my mouth with the fries.     I am looking forward to coming back here and trying many other items, especially their breakfast items, which are served all day.   Since this place opens 24 hrs you can eat breakfast anytime you want.  That's another plus in my book.  Just lose those rancid smelling dish towels used as table napkins and get some AC action going and then Coppelia will be even better!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kimberly K.,/user_details?userid=55J0clsbH_Cvs3DyOem9PA,"New York, NY",3/3/2014,1.0,"I love the food and wish I could comment on the food separately...if so I'd call this place the best diner/Cuban snack food place in Manhattan. But not anymore. My husband and I used to order 3 times a week for the last 2 years for dinners and party snacks, and I ordered their oatmeal and a side of plantains every morning on my way to work. Service really began to fall off about 6 months ago and has gotten to the point where we won't be giving them our business anymore. The take-out order girl is confused by the menu, and when she can't understand what you're saying makes any answer up. She didn't understand ""bacon, well done,"" so she insisted there was a chef's rule against cooking bacon well done. (Um...really?) What took the cake--my husband went in to order oatmeal, and asked it be made with milk instead of water, my usual. Julio, the manager, told him its not possible to make oatmeal with milk instead of water. We said this confused us--they always did before. Julio said we were wrong. We pulled up a picture of the milk-based oatmeal I'd eaten for breakfast a few days before, with their usual blackberries on top and their own takeout bag in the foreground: ""no, we didn't do that. It is impossible to cook oatmeal with milk."" Wait...it isn't? Then MAGIC is afoot, because I've seen it done...and then eaten it. My husband finally asked, politely, if Julio and the chef would attempt to make it with milk to humor us as regulars, Julio cursed and glared and yelled at the chef to make it. When it came out, the oats were uncooked and in a clump at the bottom of the cup, hot milk on top. No berries. Hot soupmilk. My husband was still nice and said as we've ordered there for years without problem it must be confusion with a new chef, hot milk with oats floating in it is not standard and WHY THE HELL ARE WE FIGHTING OVER OATMEAL, it takes 5 minutes and is cheap and the restaurant was slow. Julio said if we didn't like how they cook we could ""go somewhere else and never come back."" Years of business, tossed aside because we dare to suggest milk-based oatmeal is possible? Adios, Coppelia. We will miss you and the huevos rancheros! Oh, you know the donut shop next door to you? They make oatmeal, with milk, for $1 less. It takes 3 minutes and it not a mirage. Our daily orders are officially to your competitors, Julio.

We split a CUBANO sandwich, served on what seemed like pumpernickel. (Cuban pumpernickel?)  The CUBAN in the name is a bit of a misnomer. Even SPANISH-SPEAKING wouldn't do it. (They have Chirasco... though it's not served Brazilian carve-at-the-table style.) But this 24 hour place is LATINO, though the clientele are more CHELSEANO. At 9:30 on Thursday, it was packed. Maybe it's emptier after drinking hours, but somehow I doubt it.  --Drink Club NYC is a roving group of NYC Drinkers... a new bar every week",https://www.yelp.com/biz/coppelia-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They have small tapas-like items, such as empanadas, fish tacos and the like but they are overpriced. We got 2 mini fish tacos for $10.  Of course, we expected them to be bigger, especially for $10! The entrees are $18-25 and average sized. This place should have 3 $$$. I got the oxtail empanadas and fish tacos and even w/ a free check-in soft drink, had to pay over $20.  A meal w/ a small appetizer will cost you $30 easy at this spot. Also, the waitress gave us an attitude after she clearly got our order wrong and then didn't even wait on us the rest of the meal. That put a bad taste in our mouths. So overall, I give this place 3 stars. (Oh, I just laughed while reading other reviews on this place. THEY HAVE LINTY CLOTH NAPKINS.

The starter finally makes it out after both of us are completely finished with our entrees and they still have the nerve to put it on the bill.

We were standing there awkwardly. They said they would give us a table soon. But after 15 min they actually gave another empty table to another group of white people. We asked and the waitress just went ""you need to wait"". Given all their customers sitting at that time were white, it made sense what they were trying to do. But it's funny to see an Asian restaurant not wanting Asian customers. But I guess racism is its philosophy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jessica T.,/user_details?userid=ptAVptn3aj78PRm-4tCqYQ,"Manhattan, NY",9/10/2017,5.0,"Thought all the dishes we got here were delicious. We started with a simple cabbage appetizer (lightly salted with some sesame oil / sesame seeds), which was surprisingly good despite its simplicity. Chicken Nanban was amazing - sweetness of chicken (honey?) coupled with tanginess of the sauce was so addictive. We also had the garlic butter fried rice (was super excited for this and it didn't disappoint)- has little mushrooms in it. The fried scallops were good (great if you like scallops but I don't ha) and had a dipping sauce similar to that on the chicken. The tamago omelette was cute but probably my least favorite (though it wasn't intensely flavorful like the other dishes and provided a good break). The potato salad was standard (nice little crunchy bits of bacon? In there that was a nice touch) as was the salmon sashimi (probably will save sashimi for sushi focused spots in future). My favorite of the night though- definitely the Sukiyaki. The beef in that soup was so tender, and the noodles were fun (potato based like japchae but shape reminded me of ramen). I will say service was a little awkward (server wasn't great at answering our questions but more language barrier than rudeness), but ok overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I loved the signature chicken nanban (fried chicken with a sweet mayo based sauce) the most and the quality of the food was high.

The waitor recommended us several dishes: The Addictive Cabbage, the Nanban chicken, and the neopolitan spaghetti. We got all of those as well as the Omelette. The omelette tasted really good but tasted like something I could make at home if I had proper ingredients. I really liked how there was cod roe in it and was slightly spicy. The Addictive cabbage was very okay. It tasted like a bunch of napa cabbage thrown together with sesame oil, sesame seeds, and salt. It wasn't very addictive for me. I LOVED the nanban chicken. It was very juicy and came with a delicious white sauce and a little bit of soy sauce. I also like how it came with a lemon to give the flavor a bit more of a kick. And by the time I got to the Neopolitan Spaghetti I was already too full to enjoy it but I love the egg on top of the pasta. The pasta itself was a  bit too sour and salty. It had too much ketchup to it in my opinion. I wish they made it less salty and a little bit more cheesy.

Sebastian P.,/user_details?userid=bYleolwK1uYYJtYDgNJHRw,"New York, NY",3/25/2019,1.0,"I have been coming here since they opened a few years ago. I visited last week to find out that something in their system changed. They used to be a non tipping restaurant (just like in Japan) supposedly paying their employees more than other places. I think that made for a great experience and prices (I thought) were right. A dinner for two, with at least 3 dishes per person, and a couple drinks usually came to 100/120. Now they did away with the non tipping thing. We were surprised to find that after we payed with a card there were three lines to leave a tip and add it up. Prices have stayed the same. So there's something weird here. Initially when they switched to non tipping they raised the prices and it made sense. Now, they did away with that but didn't lower their prices. Maybe this was a mistake or something they've added as an optional? I don't know. Not cool. Unless they change this in any way I won't be coming back.

I was in Brooklyn for a few days visiting my friend from childhood and he took me to this lovely restaurant, which he says is his favorite. I see why. We sat on the back patio which was So Pretty. They started us out with bread (oh no carbs! #worthit). The waiter served it with balsamic and EVOO which, omg! I love it when restaurants do that. My date(?) Can I call it a date? Yes it was a date, methinks it was a date.. yay finally.. he took me on a date(screams in schoolgirl joy) . Anyways..so  then we got the French onion soup --which was good but, tbh I have had better. I don't know where but now I want to go back to double check that... He got the chicken, I got the mussels. He ate all his and so did I. He actually didn't care for the mussels, said they weren't firm enough.. *Kanye shrug* I loved em, the lemony flavor of the sauce was divine. I dipped the bread in the sauce and I ended up pretty full,  if I had opted for pasta I would've been way too full. Then he insisted on dessert, he got the key lime pie which normally they are out of. so I'll just say it twas me, I made the pie appear, I'm good luck ^_^ ...about the pie, well I'm not a key-lime-pie-girl but I had a taste, and it was high quality pie for sure... 5 stars, thank you SweetWater.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

If you buy the bass, the steak, or whatever protein, it will be soaked in butter which is how unskilled chefs at Great American Restaurants make things ""taste good.""  I have never eaten here and not had diarrhea for 2 days because of the butter. Tonight, I got the Southwestern Salad which turned out not to be a salad at all but a  rich salty, buttery, pile of what I would consider, more like salad dressing, that one could possibly scatter sparingly over actual greens to make something palatable and not waste it. I just go there because my kids like the place for sentimental reasons, despite that they get diarrhea every time from the butter food too. It makes no sense to me!

I had the lamb burger and I loved that it came with a lentil salad and a perfectly toasted English muffin, but the flavor just wasn't there. It was pretty bland. Thankfully it had a yogurt sauce and harissa sauce but still. It lacked salt. And the salad seemed to be completely undressed.

I'll be honest, when I saw the menu I didn't find it intriguing. In fact, I was debating whether it'd be acceptable to pay $19 for steak tacos. I gave the tacos a chance and they are by far one of the best tacos I've had in my life. The steak was perfectly cooked, the guac was fresh with the perfect amount of lemon, the green salsa left me wanting more, the queso fresco - amazing, and finally the corn tortillas tasted homemade but can't confirm that. It was so delicious that I went back the following week only to discover that the steak tacos were not permanently on the menu but happened to be a special item on that day I visited.

Ofelia E.,/user_details?userid=pFvJD_u68-FSvXKnluTDqA,"New York, NY",3/5/2021,5.0,"So glad I checked this place out last night, everything was delicious! There were no reservation slots for 7pm available but we decided to stop by anyway. They didn't have anything indoors available so we were seated outside in the front. They have individual compartments for each table with a heater in each, so even though it was cold we were comfortable. Still, make sure to dress warmly. We started off with the fried calamari and the French onion soup. The calamari was crispy and tasted fresh, paired perfectly with a side of arugula. The French onion soup was served piping hot which is exactly what we needed, it was so tasty. Lots of flavor and a good portion to be split amongst 2. Then we got the hanger steak and the Sweetwater burger. My boyfriend said the burger was good but nothing amazing. The fries however, he loved. I really liked my hanger steak. It was juicy and tasted really great for a cheap price. It was served with lightly battered onion rings which were fried perfectly and not stringy. Everything was beautifully presented and the staff were super friendly and fast! Everything came out quickly and they were attentive without being too intrusive. Make sure you also get their bread basket too with the olive oil with balsamic, so so good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They literally took 45 minutes to make a hanger steak, lamb burger, and baked fish tacos. Really!!!! We complained and did nothing.

Our waitress took it back but then another women came back out with the steak asking us to check it again because she thought it was medium rare. Very bizarre behavior to question a customer when it was clearly overdone hut we felt too awkward to return it again and just spent $40 on an unenjoyable steak.

I was across the street when it started raining really heavy and I quickly ran to this place because the other restaurant did not want to serve us due to my allergy. This place was so accommodating, especially since we came right as they were closing, they gave us multiple tables because it kept raining on us, and made sure our night wasn't ruined. My friends and I all ordered the chickpea curry dish with shrimp, it was delicious. Somewhat spicy, and it was similar to a broth or soup that we dipped the sourdough bread in, such a great dinner option. The backyard seating was very cute, and so photo worthy. Overall, 10/10 experience and it definitely made my day way less horrible than it was.

My boyfriends mother got it and I really regretted not getting it over my lentils curry which was good but not nearly as good as the fish she got. Lastly the mussels were fabulous and we were all fighting over the broth in the end. Friendly service easy to reserve a table especially at 5:30pm on a Sunday.

Sarah, who was our waiter, greeted us in a timely fashion & took our order. My mother ordered an appetizer which was the fried calamari (which was salty) & it's sauce was VERY salty as well. My mother & I had the Sweetwater burger which came with a salad & fries but we subbed our regular fries for sweet potatoes fries & cooked our burgers medium, while my grandmother ordered the lentil burger. My burger was cooked to perfection, I honestly loved it. But everything else was just salty, not seasoned, but SALTY.

The gnocchi wasn't bad but I think it lacked the chewiness. It could use a little more garlic flavor. The mussels, on the other hand, were quite delicious. I usually prefer mussels in wine but this was soaked in beer, which I think brought out the mussel flavor even more.  The service was really friendly and quick Our orders came out within 10 minutes.

Gato J.,/user_details?userid=kYbOwxYGzAOrzQvWV7g5Cg,"Dallas, TX",7/3/2019,1.0,"Let me tell you what happened yesterday around 5 PM at Sweetwater. I was sitting on the patio and the resturant was almost completely empty. I had two friends with me and my dogs and we were eating and drinking when I became over heated and excused myself to go sit inside in the air conditioning. I sat a table near the bar and started to get worse and the room was spinning and I started sweating profusely. I was fighting to keep my eyes open and stay in a seated position. I waved for my friends when the door was opened to the patio becuase I felt at that point that I couldn't walk but they didn't notice me. The waitstaff of the restaurant were rude and I guess they didn't recognize me from the patio and kept trying to get my order and offer me a menu. How crazy is that?! At one point I politely asked for a cold wet towel one girl made a face and went over to a sink and got a paper towel that she ran under the tap. She brought it over and it was room temperature. I was very quiet and polite through the whole event though the staff acted like I was this huge inconvenience. The bartender acted angry the entire time and when she finally realised I wasn't going to order anything she asked if I was feeling OK. I told her that I thought I might be having a heatstroke and she made a face and walked to the other end of the bar. I guess they thought I was a drunk or something. I was having margaritas (watered down, very weak margaritas) on the patio earlier. But not enough to make me intoxicated and I was eating and drinking a lot of water at the same time. My friends finally saw me and came to help. I haven't felt right since then, even after drinking glass after glass of ice water. So I have just called and told a very young sounding supervisor what happened to me at her restaurant. She reacted in glib manner and seemed not to take me seriously. The entire event was very odd to say the least and I'm still not sure what to think about it. Was the waitstaff just young and inexperienced and unfamiliar with what being overheated looked like? I think its probably more to do with the waitstaff looking at customers as how they make money and not as people. I was very respectful and polite through the whole event and I have been going to Sweetwater for years and always tip well and have been a great customer. But I feel that Sweetwater is just trying to make a buck and if a customer is having trouble then that customer becomes an annoyance. My advice is go spend your money at someplace that looks at its customers as human.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My favorite part is the back garden. When we arrived it was occupied but very soon we got a table in the garden, so i was happy about that. Food was very good, well prepared, and there is thought into it. They are allergy sensitive and vegan friendly. No vegan desert though. Servers where polite and accommodating but definitely needs a bit more attention, water on the table before we ask, we waited for about ten minutes for water and then we had to ask for the bread. No salt and pepper on our table. They seem to be slow and tired, which i get, i worked in a restaurant for years. Just certain things should be no brainer, that is why we dine out versus staying home. Food gets 10 out of ten, if you add a gluten & dairy free dessert, you have me. But because i love the garden chances are, i am going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sweetwater-restaurant-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nice neighborhood bistro ambience, albeit busy. Not really the call for a quiet romantic evening, but a warm and friendly feeling and a charming atmosphere. Waiters working hard to make it work, floaters pitching in to keep it going. Our table sampled the fried calamari, which was pretty darn good and we're picky about that; light, fresh and tender; the surest clue that a restaurant has a high quality bar. We also had the onion soup with gruyere which won a strong nod, the sausage and bean soup was terrific, and the rib eye steak was outstanding.

The waiter was far more interested in upselling and showing his indifference rather than trying to provide a memorable service. I was so surprised to read all the positive reviews. Where was the manager Rachel mentioned in some other reviews? Nobody bothered to come to us and ask how we were doing. Such a waste of our time and money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/popular-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Lilli S.,/user_details?userid=-UA3I1NQIdLZSy7ZHrJNKw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/21/2022,5.0,"I saw that the photos were beautiful on Yelp but this place is absolutely gorgeous beyond the expectations set. Tucked away in an oasis on Christie street, past a secret garden, then behind these two impressive escalator space portals to the hotel above. Both the bar/lounge and restaurant have plentiful, beautifully designed seating. And the entire establishment is adorned in greenery. It's like the rainforest cafe for sophisticated adults and unsophisticated foodies like me. I had to get the Popular Pisco Sour because when in Lima... one of the best cocktails I've ever had. I also had to try the classic ceviche which honestly blew my mind - the broth? Was so delicious and almost had a delicate chorizo flavor. The dish itself, all the dishes are absolutely beautiful. For entrees we got the shrimp rice which comes served in skillet, the sticky prawns (bigger than photos suggest! Definitely entree sized), the swordfish, and the market fish (striped bass with micro green salad and delicious sauce). We also got an order of yucca for the table (served two ways, fried and boiled? With another delicious sauce). The swordfish was my favorite entree - out of all the swordfish I've had, this somehow packed double the flavor. And since the fish plates come with just the fish (and a lot of garnish) - I would definitely recommend ordering some carbohydrates off the veggie section of the menu, and I do highly recommend the yucca which is just melt in your mouth. For dessert we tried the Neapolitan ice cream - my father in law is the number one ice cream fanatic and he was losing it at how good this flag of ice cream was. I tried it, it was pretty darn good and served really cool (in a rectangle). My boyfriend and I shared the baked Alaska which also blew my mind - covered in edible flowers and a graham-ish cracker cookie crumble, the meringue was marshmallowy and soft, piped kind of comically like the coronavirus (big spiky ball). Inside the ice cream was two flavors I couldn't identify but they were in the honey, graham-y world and almost cookie dough textured. It's a huge dessert, and I highly recommend getting it whether or not you have other people to share it with. Blown away by this magical place. It's expensive, but it's worth it! Also... not pretentious at all and very kind staff. I wish I had taken photos but I was too mesmerized. Excellent place to take a good friend for a birthday surprise :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/popular-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I requested our tables be close together but due to  the layout they couldn't do it. Luckily 2 people bailed last minute and we were able to cut down our party size and sit next to each other. They were very friendly and accommodating on the matter, especially with bringing the cake to the back ($10 cut fee pp). We all started off with some drinks, I got the pisco sour. It was one of the best I've had in nyc tbh. Additionally we tried two of the ceviches, one traditional and I forgot the second. Also very good, with just the right amount of cream and lemon flavor. For my entree I had the sticky prawn. My friends adjacent to me ordered the scallops and duck leg. All three dishes were amazing. I wish the scallops were a little bigger but that's just my want overall at restaurants. Overall great good, music, services, and vibes. It was busy for a Tuesday night.

Worst E.,/user_details?userid=Xz6Zed2f_2VykkUkdeqOtQ,"Brooklyn, NY",11/17/2022,1.0,"Worst NYC restaurant experience ever. 0 stars. I was staying at the Public for a staycation and decided to have breakfast at the hotel before going home. The server and busser/runner working were absolutely lovely! The person I'm guessing was managing was THE WORST. I was there last Sunday (11/13) around 10:30am. Everything started out fine with the server. I ordered the bread and pastry basket and a side of eggs. When the runner dropped off the food, I was surprised by the bread and pastry basket (picture attached). I was underwhelmed and wanted to ask if I could get something else instead. I tried to get the runner/busser's attention but I figured someone would be back to check on me and I was hungry so I started eating the eggs (they were not warm but as I mentioned, I was hungry). I didn't see the server and the runner was busy but someone else came out on the floor who seemed to be the manager (I'll be referring to him as the manager) so I tried to get his attention. He was focused on a couple who had seated themselves (it wasn't very busy but the staff was struggling to manage the flow of guests). He told them ""I see you've seated yourselves."" They responded by asking if they could have coffees and he told them ""if you want coffees you can go over there. This is a full breakfast menu."" They responded by saying ""yes. This is where the hotel breakfast is?"" They had two packages of unopened cookies they had set on the table and he said ""this is a full breakfast menu and you can't have outside food in here."" Their response ""oh sorry."" They put the cookie packages away as the manager walked away from them. The runner came back and took their order. I was able to get the runner's attention and explain to him that I'd like something else. He took the bread and pastry basket away. The manager immediately came over and said ""We don't just order things and decide that we don't want them so I'm not going to be able to take this off your check. I can't resell this."" I hadn't asked him to and he didn't ask me what the issue was. I told him ""I understand it's wasteful and a hassle to send this back but I had expected something else. I feel like it was misrepresented on the menu and I would have sent it back right away had someone checked in but I was having difficulty getting anyone's attention."" He said ""Yes. It is wasteful and a hassle."" We went back and forth a bit and he ended by telling me ""I'll take it off the bill but just for YOUR future reference, we don't order things and decide we don't want them."" I have never encountered such a rude person in the service industry. I worked in NYC restaurants for about 8 years as a server, bartender, and manager. I know working the breakfast/brunch shift can be terrible but this guy was so rude to the couple next to me and to me. Also having worked in the industry, I know that ""we"" do send things back when they are not what ""we"" expected or wanted. I also know that it's pretty awful customer service to berate the customers. Having worked in the industry, I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt but this guy was BEYOND. He was so rude that I created this yelp account and felt the need to write my first review ever.

It was just a perfect meal and evening from the setting, the drinks (pisco sour), to the  food: ceviche clasico and nikkea, roast carrots were great as was the lomo saltado, all finished by the ridiculous pumpkin tres leche cake with salted caramel ice cream.

But what's important is the food it's to die for. Small portions so be warned but  the flavors are everything. I highly recommend the ahi tuna ceviche over the octopus ceviche. The lomo saltado was incredible. And the scallops were delicious. Salted caramel ice cream was so yummy. Now the service was everything we had Bowie he was super attentive, friendly, and gave us the best service.

We waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us and ended up having to hail someone down ourselves. Once we got our food, no one checked up on us or refilled our waters. A group sat down next to us and they were friends with one of the waiters. He got them free food and free drinks while ignoring us. Once we were done with our food, obviously no one came up to us. I saw two waiters working together, taking their sweet time to set up a single table. I finally got the attention of one of the waiters and asked for the check. A couple minutes go by and I see him chatting in the front. I call another waiter who eventually brings out the check. As my boyfriend is paying, the waiter is staring straight at the card reader to make sure that he tips well. We ended up tipping 20% even though they deserved nothing because my boyfriend felt the waiter breathing down his neck. It was so uncomfortable.

Is $17 for plain mashed avocado on bread with a crack of pepper, a singular leaf, and a few eggs justifiable in NYC? Not sure. Have I had tastier, more creative, and equally ~grammable~ avocado toasts in NY for far less? Absolutely (peep Golden Diner's galangal toast, for one). It simply tasted blander than what I could put together in 5 min at home. The saving grace (and sole reason I believe this place deserves more than 1 star) is the scrambled egg, which I was genuinely intrigued by. I initially thought it would be a soft scrambled egg going off images, but I actually feel it's more similar to tamagoyaki in concept, the underside of the top layer being a coil of egg layers that get pretty thin. While intriguing, it wasn't tasty enough to justify the whole toast's cost. It's not like any of it tasted bad, but you really get the sense people only come because it looks rather than tastes nice, because if you can't make just as good avocado toast at home with your eyes closed, I really am not sure what to say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/good-thanks-cafe-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I need to say that I was not a fan of scallop sashimi, but the way they prepare it changed my mind on scallop sashimi! That it was sweet and fresh is expected, but the yuzu and serano combination used to dress the scallop made it so different and memorable. But I have a problem at the Brasserie.

The seafood is exceedingly fresh, but some of the rolls were a chefs experimentation with flavors that didn't gel well. Sake selection (and I've been trained in Tokyo) was lovely and it's a great respite from the grocery and butcher. Definitely hit up the gourmet sauce/oils/kitchenware spots. Scored a gorge pair of chopsticks. Many beautifully curated and unique finds and expensive but not like WTF expensive prices. Will definitely go again to experience more bourgeois loveliness and the House of the Red Pearl.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tin-building-by-jean-georges-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were welcomed, they remembered me, that was very special. On 1/14 Saturday late dinner (9:30pm reservation), we ordered the prix fixe from the bar, everything on the menu. We were not disappointed. Starter was salad w miso dressing and an injera type roti bread; it was light and delicious. Then we had a fresh baked sour dough with fresh soft in house made sea salt butter (Amazing). For dinner we had the tile fish and beef shoulder, both delectable and full of flavor. Tried the wizard's comb cocktail and loved it. At dessert we shared the passion biscuit and chocolate situation. Both were wonderful. So for $65 prix fixe it's a deal.

We dine out every weekend and try to sample restaurants on ""best"" lists, so have a good reference point. If  you do pre-fix with no choice of substitute for this price, it has to be special. It was not. Scallop dish was good but I had a few gritty pieces. Meat had nice sauce and flavor, but a bit tough.

I'm so happy that I made the time to come here and try a lot of great food. Went to the back garden where they do their a la carte menu as opposed to the prix fixe within the main restaurant where you can see the kitchen. The service was impeccable as everyone was greeting me and all the staff was super friendly. We ended up eating with a chef of the restaurant as someone in our party knew her, so that was cool to get a glimpse into Oxalis' style and learn more about what we were eating. We ended up ordered... everything on the menu! My highlights were certainly the sourdough bread (which it seems like everyone and their mother is talking about); that butter was special!! But more than that, I loved the tomato spread with the rosemary lavender bread; I could have eaten that all up! I think the mushroom kebab (which just isn't a kebab at all) fell a bit flat, but still - all in all, this was a SPECIAL meal. The buttermilk dessert + the peach tart really rounded it all out. And my orange wine cocktail was delicious and served in the perfect glass. I know they have a more rotating menu here, so I'd love to come back sooner rather than later to try some great food. It came out to a bit less than $100/person, so considering it is a 1 Michelin-star place and we got everything on the menu, I think that's great; each dish isn't quite expensive so you can come in for a drink and some food and not break the budget.

The staff did their best and offered their a la carte menu to us along with some free champagne (Obi Wine Keno Blue - cute play on Star Wars). Luckily as we were considering whether we should stay or not (not saying their a la carte wasn't appealing but mom wanted the big welcome for the new son-in-law), the general manager, Adrienne. stepped in and informed us someone cancelled. We were very lucky. (They usually have a set amount of ingredients and courses set for reservations so if you don't have reservations, from what I was told, they don't squeeze people in.) Everything was exceptional from presentation to taste. Service was wonderful and if I could come back more often for date night I would. Later, we found out their head chef (and owner) were originally from the West Coast (West Coast is the best coast - makes perfect sense why the food was so bomb) and moved out to New York to start his business here.

The shishito peppers came with a ""teriyaki"" flavored sauce, which added a variety of flavors to the peppers.

An hour and a half later I called again to see where I was in the queue and was told I'm next in line (7:30 pm). So my partner and I walked to a nearby bar to get a drink and chat. At this point (8:15 pm), we made a quick reservation for a 9:00pm slot (under the belief we would get an option for the tasting menu like promised) and walked over at 8:45 pm and spoke to the hosts. My partner and I were surprised by the passive aggressiveness and catty comments from the staff, and were told if we canceled we would be charged.

Joe Joe B.,/user_details?userid=KaQXmoL9fhITB4LEeorN5g,"Brooklyn, NY",12/14/2021,5.0,Why didn't I find you earlier!!! Perfection! Just go to this place...but if you need to know why keep reading. Went for dinner and sat in the back courtyard. This is the more casual Al la crate setting. Still a lovely setting. But let me start with the greeting. You walk in the door and the kitchen is right there. Open and inviting. Smells of the amazing good greet you. A cook says hello and asked for our name. Even though there are hosts it was a nice way to be welcomed. We are led to our table. Every member of the friendly staff saying hello. Now let's get down to the main event. The drinks and meal! Every dish was heaven. The sourdough (fresh and warm with fresh butter.) Jambon! Totally different then plain old ham or prosciutto. The tuna carpaccio. Wow. Balanced and light. Sweet potatoes (lovely and light.) Next was the trout. This was the star of the show! I could eat this dish every minute of every day. And the beef was fantastic too. Drinks were fantastic and the wine selection is solid too. I will be back for the indoor set menu soon!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxalis-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Lynn W.,/user_details?userid=3DYLC4ZCEb4i_-xRugurZQ,"Flushing, NY",1/7/2020,4.0,We made reservations for a party of 10. Our prefix dinner was $70pp. The service was amazing. This restaurant is more American rather than French based on the food we had. If you're looking for French food this is not the place. I felt the quality of the food was very fresh and dishes were unique and creative. I love the open kitchen as you walk in. I would've preferred to see the regular menu however our meal started promptly when our party arrived. I didn't realize we had an option to try other items on their menu until we were done with our meal. This was not necessarily the restaurants fault but rather me not asking as I was content with the meal that was previously arranged by my party. I was curious as we left the restaurant what else we could've tried while we were there but did not get a chance to try. If you have a big appetite this prefix dinner would not have been enough to fill you up. This is definitely a quality over quantity type of place.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxalis-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Christin M.,/user_details?userid=383fieseMn4s6pHoNY7ugQ,"Baltimore, MD",5/20/2019,5.0,"Highly recommended for an adult evening out, special date night, or an occasion to celebrate. You'll enjoy an excellent meal, carefully crafted and conceptualized, from start to finish. I'd also suggest, if you're a duo, that you request the table with front row seats of the kitchen and the chef at work. I thoroughly enjoyed the added bonus of a show and it was really neat to see the composition and plating of each dish making its way to us. Oxalis offers a prix fixe dinner service (offerings change nightly) with optional wine pairing at an additional cost. My spouse and I elected to go all in and we loved the complete experience of everything being expertly selected for us - what a fun and delicious treat! We also relished in being surprised with the menu offerings for the evening when we sat at our places (hidden but neatly placed under our napkin and bread plate). Don't be afraid to ask questions - the staff, even the chef, are very friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes, the creative ingredients as well as the wine pairings. I was also shocked by my favorite course of the evening; glancing at the menu I knew I was looking forward to the soft shell crab and while everything was excellent, I was absolutely blown away by the potato, ramp, and kombu spring stew. It was so unexpected for me, I loved every bite. Both flavor and texture variety were perfect. That said, be open to being pleasantly surprised. Oxalis will come through in an amazing way and provide a very memorable dining experience.

Literally, each bite, I closed my eyes to experience the incredible blend of flavors. We had two more appetizers that were equally fantastic. We also did the wine pairing which had perfect choices for all the courses. I added caviar to the fluke, which was outstanding. The beef with walnut miso, and black garlic melted in my mouth with the greatest flavors. Three different desserts put this evening over the top.

This restaurant works perfectly for the part of Brooklyn it's in, which you kind of feel before you even open the door. The quality of the dishes the Oxalis team serve will astound you and are worth every dollar. They do rotating tasting menus, but also offer food and drink off an ala carte menu in the back half of the restaurant. You can tell that Nico and Co. know what they are doing, and also, most importantly, that they care. Being able to watch the chefs and cooks working so diligently in the open kitchen is quite humbling, but also inspiring. I think we could all learn a thing or two about delicious, fresh, new ways of approaching food and it'll be fun to see it happen here. Aspiring chefs, foodies, and regular people of all walks of life, in and out of Brooklyn, should give Oxalis a try. Maybe you'll learn something new, see something great, or just enjoy a nicely prepped and prepared meal, served to you by their nice staff. The last time I ate there, I tired the pig trotter and it was my favorite. I also had a dessert made with cream cheese ice cream, which brought out my inner fat kid, for sure.

Oxalis is without a doubt, the most pleasant, refreshing and jaw-droppingly delicious meal I've had in years. The food was otherworldly. We had the prix fixe and each dish was better than the last. The service was fantastic as was the atmosphere. I have a ton of food allergies to raw whole fruits and vegetables (I know, my life sucks) and they were so accommodating and created two entirely different dishes for me (though what my family ate for those courses was apparently also fantastic). To top it all off, the dessert (goat milk with honey and thyme - trust me, totally different than what you're probably imagining right now) was perhaps the best dessert I've had in my life and I've come to to the realization that was the peak of my dessert journey and I'm fine with that. Overall, a magical, warm, inviting, flavorful, surprising experience.

However, I wish I had paid more attention to the health violations posted on Yelp regarding improper handling of their raw foods. I ended up trying what seemed like their most popular dish on Yelp, their squid ink pasta, and suffered from severe food poisoning! I suspect it was related to the shrimp in the squid ink pasta. In one of their Yelp health violations, they had an issue where ""smoked or processed fish was held above 38 °F"" which I failed to have noticed when I was reading their Yelp reviews.

Zeno L.,/user_details?userid=es-muTmTs14Zp6Z2ctMCJg,"New York, NY",11/5/2021,2.0,"We are a group of friends trying cacio e pepe at all the different Italian restaurants in NYC. Six of us ordered it. So it was the standard price at $24 but was by far the worst cacio e pepe I've had so far in NYC. The pasta was tasteless, lacking salt. If there was any pecorino cheese, I could not taste it. They either substituted it for another cheese or put so little of it that the taste was absent. To add insult to injury, the pepe (pepper) was not the standard roasted and ground peppercorns, but red spicy peppercorns. This dish should be called cacio e peperoncino and not the original Roman pasta dish that is notoriously difficult to make despite its small number of ingredients. On top of that the waitstaff asked if we wanted to put parmesan cheese on top.  This shows how clueless Da Claudio is about this classic Italian dish.  You don't put a different cheese to dilute the taste of pecorino cheese. It's a huge no no. The food is one star, but I gave two stars for their attempts at rectifying the disappointment by offering us a replacement. A few of us got replacement dishes. I abstained fearing that the quality of the other dishes would be reflected in the quality of what I ordered initially. That was confirmed when the replacement dishes were also of low quality.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-claudio-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Vivian L.,/user_details?userid=T2yEDkQOC2DMNdO5BNPg5Q,"New York, NY",3/15/2017,3.0,I like the pasta but I give it 2.5 stars Bc it's overpriced and too salty. I tried the lamb ragu when it first opened. I didn't particularly like the taste hence I never went back. Recently I noticed they started serving squid ink pasta - I have to try it. I ordered the linguine nere (squid ink pasta) and spaghetti carbonara. Both dishes met my expectations but it was too salty. The only complaint is the portions are relatively small compared to the price. This is not the same quality as Michael White's restaurants so I was remised to see the entrees on the pricey side.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-claudio-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Andres B.,/user_details?userid=838Mh4TzIzk2fUMaEo7y6g,"New York, NY",10/18/2021,1.0,"First off the Resturant states it has heaters for outside, and they didn't have any. So had to freeze while eating. My wife had the pesto Gnocchi and it was bland, no flavoring at all, then the waiter came to put cheese on her pasta and the cheese grater broke and fell into her food. So had to wait for a new dinner plate for her. I had the spicy marguerita and it wasn't good, barely any margarita in the small glass cup they gave because it had a huge block of ice taking up most of the cup, so there barely any space for marguerita. The worker that was putting utensils and plates on table was a bit rude like he didn't want to be there. Also put forks and knives directly  on table after we ate appetizer. We were eating outside, why would you place utensils directly on a table that's outside with no napkin under it? I asked to get new utensils and he put the new ones directly on the table again after I told him I didn't want my fork or knife touching directly the table that was not covered. Then I had to ask again for utensils and had to tell him to give them to me in my hand because he was going to place them back on the table... my pasta was pretty good I had the rigatoni Napoleon , only bad thing about is they only put 1 meat ball, 1 small sausage and 1 small pork rib in the meal. Could've put more in it. To the appetizer, I had fried calamari and it was bland also. No flavoring at all. The sauce that came with it was good tho. Sorry to say I will not be going there again and I won't recommend this place to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-claudio-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The ragou on the fusilli was really flavorful and the meat was extremely tender. Some pieces of my pasta were a bit beyond al dente to the point of being a bit underdone.

The appetizers sounded pretty tasty from the description on the menu, but when presented,we asked ourselves if that's what we actually ordered. Needless to say, the appetizer wasn't very tasty. Moving onto the entrees. We were very excited to try the lamb ragu. Tasty lamb meat, but the sauce itself was VERY salty. The fusilli pasta also seemed to be on the under cooked side as the texture was a bit hard/doughy. The other entree we ordered was very salty as well, so the entrees were very disappointing. The desserts were delicious, however. The tiramisu was PERFECT. Very fluffy, creamy, delicate, and delightful. The sorbets were very good as well. Too bad we couldn't enjoy the appetizer and entrees.

My GF and I went there for their Mother's Day dinner with my family. She and my father ordered the Pollo for two and it came very quickly. When she cut into the thigh we discovered that the chicken was undercooked (only after having a few bites that I completely regret) so we sent it back. It took them 20 minutes to refire and I was shocked to discover that instead of cooking a new chicken, they just put it back in the oven and completely dried it out. Then the check comes and instead of comping a dried piece of salmonella, I find they kept it on the check. Have you no pride De Claudio's? Either refire the entree with a new chicken or comp it, but instead you choose to give us crappy food and expect us to pay for it.

When we asked for a table, the mc said he could only seat us if we have him our phone number and that he adds us to some sort of list. This is the first time I heard of such an invasion of privacy, and I have been living in UWS for years. He further started mansplaining the rule, as if it was the most natural rule, in a grilling way. We wanted a weekend brunch, not anxiety Central, so we left. If I wanted to be grilled by arrogant men, I would have not left the country and lived in Turkey, no thank you.

The food took so LONG to get to my table. The zuchinni fritters were great, and I would actually recommend them! The lamb shank was also good but not great.

I allowed a customer with her elder mom to go in front of me to use the only bathroom and paid for that with a 10 minute wait. I did a close approximate count of customers at that time. 15 were outdoors and at least 35 were indoors. Expecting to serve 50 customers with a single bathroom is very unfair. Guys set up a second bathroom there, no excuses get it done. We are going into 100% capacity later in May and your restaurant bathroom issue will only worsen.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/leyla-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sonia P.,/user_details?userid=HhYwKIrRRbglmrbmc-j3UA,"New York, NY",9/7/2021,2.0,"I'm very confused with the glowing reviews and suspicious of where they come from since my hummus, falafel and pita (which actually was store brought bread cut into slices, nothing like the Mediterranean pita bread) were way below average. And these are just basics of any Mediterranean place. Hummus tasted like it came from a jar, prolly store brought with the bread with little to no tahini and hence quite grainy with just beets added on top. My friend's veggie risotto was under seasoned and not very tasty either. Drinks were okay and service was good which was literally the only saving grace of our night here. For authentic Mediterranean food without subdued flavours and store brought stuff, try hummus place in the neighborhood.

My mom has a dairy allergy - nothing out of the ordinary - but we figured a restaurant in New York could handle that. We were completely wrong. Not only did my mother go through six dishes asking if they could make simple changes like taking cheese off a pita bread or asking to have rice without butter since the pre-made rice is cooked with butter. All three of us understand that accommodating an allergy may take a little extra time, but the staff was unwilling to even help us, simply offering my mom a side salad or some cooked vegetables. I'm no Guy Fieri, but even I know how to cook a little bit of rice without butter and I know it takes 10 minutes tops.

Penny P.,/user_details?userid=rRxNn2uNvE6iURICpK42TQ,"New York, NY",5/15/2022,3.0,"My friend and I made a reservation and were seated promptly. After that, we became invisible to the entire staff. There were staff members standing around and walking by and we tried to ask them multiple times who our waiter was. At one point, someone took our order. He did not introduce himself and acted like he was doing us a favor.  We ordered hummus and a cheese flatbread to start. The flatbread was delicious, but the hummus came with what tasted like rye bread. My friend and i inquired with the staff about other bread choices and every person we asked was confused. I've never been served hummus without pita bread so i was surprised when someone told me they don't have pita bread. After a very long wait, our main entrees came and the food was good but not once did any staff member come by to ask if our food was ok or if we needed anything else. We wanted to order dessert, but decided since the service was so slow we wouldn't have time. When i asked for the bill, that was the quickest part of the night. Someone immediately swiped my card on a portable cc machine and within seconds i paid.  I found it funny that the quickest part of the evening was them taking my money. After leaving, my friend and I still did not know who our waiter was, or who the tip went to unless it's split amongst the whole staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/leyla-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We had tapas-style appetizers to share (buttery beef tongue, an eggplant dip packed with flavor, a divine cheese pide, and a yummy lamb pide), and then each had an equally tasty main course. Service was a little slow, but I attribute that to opening week growing pains and the servers were so kind and made such good recommendations that we didn't mind the wait.

Talia F.,/user_details?userid=of1swnkXfovqGfAv6BJX8w,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/11/2021,1.0,"This was the most horrifying dining experience I have ever had.  IF YOU HAVE ANY FOOD ALLERGIES OR INTOLERANCES DO NOT COME HERE. When ordering, I indicated that I had a gluten intolerance and asked for confirmation that the items we were ordering were gluten free. When our salad arrived, I started serving it when I realized there was a piece of bread under the initial layer of the salad. I called over the waitress and told her what had happened. She was VERY nonchalant, did not apologize and then said that maybe I HAD PUT THE BREAD IN THE SALAD because the salad does not contain bread. There was no bread on the table, so her accusation would have involved me bringing my own bread (in my pocket?) and putting it in the salad just to send it back? This is a truly unbelievable accusation... when she could have just apologized and brought out a new salad. When she brought the new salad I gave her the benefit of the doubt and explained that what had happened was very worrisome because I would have had a severe physical reaction if I had eaten the bread. She again didn't seem to care so I asked that she tell the manager. After a meal of closely examining every bite before consuming it, we received no real apology and no acknowledgement from the manager. My mom asked to speak with the manager, again assuming the waitress didn't understand the health risks associated with what had happened. The manager came over and simply said the kitchen may have dropped in the bread.......... I would strongly, strongly advise against anyone with food allergies / intolerances from coming here, as they clearly don't understand the safety risks of their actions. I also wouldn't advise ANYONE to come here because you'd be hard pressed to find worse customer service in the city and if they treat food allergies / intolerances so nonchalantly I can only imagine that they are similarly nonchalant about other food safety issues.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/leyla-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They describe themselves as ""Mediterranean brasserie that combines key elements of Turkish rustic-haute cuisine with a worldly take of the finest mediterranean recipes.""  There are Turkish elements and dishes, but not everything is purely Turkish...but everything was purely delicious.  We enjoyed the Lahmacun - and it was flavorful and crisp.  We also started with the eggplant caviar, which I enjoyed more than any baba ganoush I've had in recent years. Great texture and light flavor.  The Parmesan crusted chicken was moist and flavorful, and the star of the show, the eriste, did not disappoint!  It was a wonderful Turkish pasta dish that I positively loved.

Great space, perfect noise level and cozy ambience. The food was honestly delicious (4). I'm a falafel aficionado and they were outstanding. Now the disappointing part. Service was terrible. Let me take that back, HORRIBLE (1). Let me be clear, it was 9.30 and wasn't packed. We got in, no hostess so we lingered there until we went for the table ourselves. They took at least 15' to take our order. Ran out of water/sparkling, never refilled them. Ran out of wine (!!), never offered a 2nd round. We waited another good 15' for them to asks us for desserts. By then only 2 were available. And then brought my expresso with no spoon or sugar to be seen. But the worst of all was the overall attitude...the whole night we felt they were doing us a favor. Their energy was a downer and, in a service industry, that's the original sin. Now, here is the kicker, it was our anniversary night, so thanks for a great experience. Luckily we won't be calling a family lawyer anytime soon but definitely won't be going back there. Hopefully you take all this as a constructive criticism...everybody (in this case really EVERYBODY except the chef) has a bad night.

As other reviews attest, the short rib pide was well-seasoned and delicious - a must-try if you decide to dine. The raki-infused branzino was also excellent if you like anisette flavoring - the fish is filleted so no need to wrestle with the skeleton if you find that challenging or unpleasant. The eggplant caviar appetizer was unremarkable and came with far less bread than was required to consume it. When we asked for an adequate amount of bread, we were told that we would have to pay an extra $1, which was gratuitous in my opinion. The affect of our server was also quite dismissive and unpleasant, and at the end of the meal my companion and I were handed a digital device to sign the check but unknowingly received the wrong cards to sign for, which should have been checked with us beforehand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/leyla-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Samantha M.,/user_details?userid=upV2GPOYdIy0GldCfzEofA,"Fairmount, Philadelphia, PA",2/6/2023,3.0,"I have been here twice before and both times the food was excellent! Both times I ordered the same thing - Breakfast Avocado Toast and a Pineapple Bellini. It was a great portion for the price, and the bottomless drinks are a great value - although I only ever ordered one drink and never ordered the bottomless. The only complaint I have about this restaurant is the service. On my first visit, I had no issues. However, on my recent visit a few days ago I was very unhappy with the service and attitude from the waiter. I ordered a Fried Egg on my avocado toast, as the menu stated you have a choice between Fried Egg, Scrambled, or Poached Egg. When he brought out my food, there were scrambled eggs on top of my avocado toast. I then informed him that I had ordered fried eggs, to which he told me that these were fried eggs because the eggs are fried. He went back and forth with me, trying to correct me that the term I was looking for was ""Sunny Side Up."" However, I am a chef so I think I know the difference between different styles of eggs. Also, a quick google search will show you that Fried Eggs are the same (also known as) Sunny Side Up - there are just two names for it. Once you scramble the yolk, the egg is no longer a traditional ""Fried Egg,"" but rather scrambled eggs, as you have scrambled them. So if what he served me wasn't scrambled eggs, but rather a Fried Egg, I am confused as to what their scrambled eggs look like. Although it may have been a simple mistake from the kitchen, it was the attitude and condescending attitude from the waiter that really turned me off. All he had to say was ""No worries, let me bring it back for you."" It is just strange to me that a waiter at a brunch restaurant seriously doesn't know what a Fried Egg is and has the nerve to correct me when a simple Google search proves him wrong. Even after showing him the Google search, he still insisted I was wrong. It was so strange to me! Next time I visit Court St I may just check out a different brunch spot, not to run into this waiter again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Melissa S.,/user_details?userid=GDwGY_ssFPvUReY7H9kIug,"Newark, NJ",7/15/2022,5.0,Yes... okay yes to this restaurant. I don't know how I found out about it but I've had it bookmarked for quite awhile. Came in for an early dinner last Saturday and was not disappointed. We were seated on the back patio which is gorgeous and thee perfect vibe for a summer evening. They started us off with complimentary bruschetta which was yummy! We got the mussels and calamari to start..highly recommend both. The star of the show for me was the Bronzino. I was in lovee. It was grilled to absolute perfection and the flavors were insane. I highhlly recommend. If you don't mind deboning it yourself I'd go for the whole one instead of the filet. Service here was awesome too. You need to bring cash to this place though because they charge you when you pay by credit card --which I think is tacky btw. I would come back though WITH CASH!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Me and my friends had a reservation and were seated a little later, which was fine because some of us were running late. we were seated in the ""outdoor"" area which was pretty well heated and covered. I ordered Canadian eggs Benedict that came with brussels sprouts and potatoes, the brussels sprouts were OK nothing exceptional, the potatoes were good and the eggs Benedict were pretty good, not too much hollandaise sauce however, they got cold fairly quickly. I'm not sure if it was the space or just eating a bit slow. Also got the unlimited bottomless brunch which was $22 a pretty good deal and you were able to switch the drink so I started with a peach Bellini, then to a mango Bellini and I also tried a pineapple Bellini. all of them were delicious and the waiter was really on top of bringing us a new glass when we were finished.

Jemima L.,/user_details?userid=XGrlBv0wo-mxal10ypYF8A,"Brooklyn, NY",10/3/2021,5.0,Verde on Smith used to be one of my go to brunch spots a few years ago. I haven't been in a long time so when a friend mentioned she went and enjoyed it so much and asked would I like to have our next meet-up there I was more than willing. We went for a late weekday brunch and the weather was a bit meh so it was pretty empty that day. I ordered the shrimp fettuccine Alfredo and it was a nice portion with good flavors. I also ordered crème brûlée for dessert and a cappuccino. We were permitted to stay past the 90 min brunch seating time allowance as it was a slower day. We really enjoyed our meal. It's great to know that they have been a consistent staple all these years. I saw menu items I knew and loved from a few years back. Definitely a great option for brunch as they have weekday and weekend brunch. The wait service was very pleasant and helpful!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Alex B.,/user_details?userid=-0bonxnmMjLUjq2Ine3W5Q,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1/29/2023,1.0,"Surprised by all of the great reviews. Maybe it's strictly a brunch spot. For $120 the two plates of pasta were bad. Not ok...literally unpleasant to eat. The vodka sauce was watery and flavorless, with the prevailing note being onion. The carbonara was all cream and similarly flavorless. Simply not worth it. Did not finish our plates.

We decided to go with the boozy brunch option ($22 with an entree) while the others in the party settled on just regular brunch/dinner courses. The table behind us was excessively loud and people actually asked to be moved away because of how loud they were. All the tables were pretty crowded together. It was hard to maneuver around. We were sat in the back room.  I could barely hear the music. Also our waiter wasn't the friendliest guy, was whatever about everything. We were waiting pretty long for our last few round of drinks and then the waiter came up to me and my sister and said ""ok your time is up"" after not being seen for 15 mins. I will say the food was good. I ended up getting the chicken sandwich with fries and it came with brussle sprouts as well. Those were delicious. But the Alfredo pasta was pretty bland.

Reshma B.,/user_details?userid=5d4J48WlBAM6CG3ABGvxBg,"New York, NY",12/17/2021,5.0,"Wow - 5 star experience!  My cousin is in town from SF and we were looking for a spot in this area.  I found Verde on Smith on Yelp and made a reservation for outdoor seating for 3 of us.  Because outdoor wasn't specified on OpenTable, I called to make sure and the guy who answered the phone was very nice and accommodating.  As we got closer to the date of our dinner, there was a Covid surge in NYC and the outdoor dining was even more imperative.  We grabbed drinks at Clover Club next door and headed over at 7PM on Fri.  It was not crowded at all - they let us check out the back patio - but to me it felt too enclosed, so we opted for a little ""bubble"" on the sidewalk.  It was great.  They even put a space heater in there to keep us warm.  The menu looked great - lots of options in the Italian/Mediterranean realm.  They started us with delicious bread (refilled twice) and we ordered a bottle of wine, apps (Goat Cheese Salad and Tuscan Stuffed Shrimp), entrees (Lobster Feast for them and Salmon Scaloppini for me), Creme Brulee for dessert, and Sparkling Moscato for them and Irish Coffee for me.  All of it was delicious.  We devoured everything.  Service was great - even though we were outside, they checked on us multiple times (refilling our water as needed), everyone fully masked, and even zipped up our little bubble each time they left.  We were all impressed by the food and the service and more importantly, I felt extremely comfortable with the seating during this tense time in the city.  Highly recommend this place, and even my visiting cousin told me I should come back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The atmosphere, the vibe, and the food all great. They sang happy birthday to my husband and offered fresh strawberries with chocolate drizzle and cream on a plate that said happy birthday. The French toast was delicious as well as the steak and eggs. We met some great people who was also celebrating a birthday as well.

Sacheen V.,/user_details?userid=QuWYxm3ij1Qsa9mUH371Xw,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",3/22/2021,5.0,This place was pretty busy on a Saturday evening. Showed up around 6:30ish. Seated quickly. They have outdoor seating on the sidewalk and also outside in the back of the restaurant. Nicely lit. Romantic Italian music playing in the background. I had a Sangria which in my opinion tasted like juice. Hefty glass but a waste of calories for me. Didn't bother to order another. We had calamari for starters and it was fresh and delicious!! Not greasy. Loved it. It was a lot. So took some home. I ordered the penne bistecca which was delicious!! So tasty. Again a lot of food on the plate. My man had steak and mashed potatoes which was also tasty. It came with salad on the side! So good! Lots of food. We both ended up bringing it home and had it for next day brunch!!!

If that hasn't tickled your fancy, stop by for the steak and cheese sandwich that has ACTUAL pieces of steak on it, not that smashed flattened chopped up mess that some call a steak sandwich.

The ambiance at night is amazing especially when dinning in the greenhouse! When I dinned for brunch I was met with more abrasive service in comparison to when I went for dinner. The workers behaved very dismissive towards me and my partner our whole brunch. During my dinner experience I may of been graced with our waiters presence once besides when our food was being brought out. Overall I don't think I will be going back which is a shame because I see the potential.

We ordered the baked clams and burrata appetizers for the table. Both were beautifully done, the burrata was silky as expected. Our dinner orders included the pappardelle ragu and the crispy gnocchi. The ragu dish was massive. Although I was sure I couldn't finish it, it was addictive and I did! My fellow diner was in love with the gnocchi. Can't remember the desserts, but I'm not really a dessert person. What is wonderful about this place above and beyond what I've already described is the service.

Came during Covid & the staff was great about keeping distance between the tables inside the restaurant. The unlimited brunch is limited to 60 minutes but the waiters are really good about giving you another drink when your current drink is done. Since this is an Italian spot I decided to try pasta as my meal. The spaghetti carbonara was very tasty and the portion size was good for the price. The drinks also tasted like they didn't skimp on the champagne/wine which I appreciated.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered bottomless brunch and I got a smoked salmon eggs benedict. My boyfriend and I also ordered crab cakes to share. For the bottomless drinks, I liked that we were able to mix and match on the drinks and they had a lot of different options/flavors (bellinis, mimosas and bloody marys). The drinks also had a good balance of alcohol and juice! The crab cakes were amazing! They were packed with crab meat and the tartar sauce wasn't even needed to highlight the flavor. My smoked salmon eggs benedict was good, but it was a little fishy for my taste. I would like to try their burger next time! The fries it came with looked really good too.

The food, however, I wouldn't say that it's authentic Italian. It may be inspired Italian food, but the spices have more of a Spanish / Latin twist to them. There was an appetizer we ordered of crab cakes and baked clams. The crab cakes were great, but the baked clams for 6 pieces were anticlimactic. There was more baked crumbs then being able to taste the clam, and two of them didn't have any clam inside of them. Each clam cost  wise was $3 a piece. They were so tiny for being that pricey. The server was kind enough to remove it from the bill because we were unsatisfied with the order of the clams. The salmon was a bit on the dry side for me and the couscous and side of broccoli rabe was flavorless. I made reservations thinking that this place was known for their seafood dishes and it was a bit of a disappointment. Maybe if there is a different approach in the kitchen and menu a bit for those specific dishes could have resulted in a better experience.

Came here over the weekend as Family was in town and wanted a place with a hip crowd and good food. Glad we chose Verde on Smith. While I did not make a reservation and called ahead for wait time, they honored the wait which was about 20 mins on a fully packed day. People patiently waited outside to be seated. Once we were seated, we were greeted with Water and a Menu. There is a 60 min seating limit to keep the flow going, which is understandable. We started with the unlimited mimosas for $20 P/P. Given the large crowds, we were afraid that we wouldn't get our hours worth of drinks...boy was I wrong. Our server kept our glasses full as we were sipping our last sip...definitely a winner in my book!!!

On the other side they have plastic pods for each table big enough for 4 people. I prefer the pods since it's individually separated from everyone else.

The egg over avocado toast was yum!  It was runny and flavorful .  Overall the food and service was good. The workers were attentive. The only thing that I was eh about was the drinks.

I'm making my way down the menu, but my favorites would be chicken francaise, penne bisteca, papardelle portobello, pork chop pizzaiola, Niçoise salad, Tuscan stuffed shrimps and octopus! I remember even the cheesecake dessert was perfect - very light and not too sweet. They raised the bar for food delivery - with excellent food quality, delivery speed, and wonderful customer service!

Unfortunately, neither of the eggs were runny like a poached egg was supposed to be, both of them came off as more soft-boiled. My boyfriend got pancakes which were good, soft and fluffy.

Every meal I've had here has been delicious from brunch to dinner. For brunch I typically get the cheesesteak sandwich and it's delicious. I love that they have bottomless mimosas but during the warmer weather days, the wait can be very long. Don't show up at 1 pm on a Saturday or Sunday and expect less than a 45 minute wait. They take your name and add it to a list and then call your name when your table is ready. For dinner I've gotten the penne vodka and the steak madeira and both were soooo good. Large portions and nicely presented. I've also tried the chicken wings, calamari and mussels and all were delicious as well. Really have no complaints! The service is always great. There has only been one time where I had bad service, but it was during brunch hour which is always so busy so I understand things can happen.

While surfing Instagram looking for a new breakfast spot I stumbled upon Verde on smith and was immediately excited to try it out as they had HEATED OUTDOOR SEATING!! Ofcourse I had to check out the menu and see some thoughts other YELPERS had. After a few minutes of surfing pics and reviews my wife, daughter and I jumped on the train eager to try a new spot. How this place remained unknown to me for so long pre pandemic is beyond me. My wife and I both decided to try one of their signature omelettes. She went with the Italian and I went with the Spanish. Both came With a side of potato wedges and salad. The best part for me personally was the fact that you could taste that it was fresh mozzarella cheese. This place had great food, great ambiance and an even better server. Megan was attentive but not pushy and never missed any of our subtle cues.

I had the spaghetti Puttanesca. It was so flavorful and so light and they gave you such an amazing portion of food and of course they have beautiful bread before you eat with a nice olive oil .

Kuzi G.,/user_details?userid=5Qvvqu2vQdOXnhQroarKvg,"Brooklyn, NY",3/3/2021,3.0,Have always wanted to try this place and finally got to check it out recently with my husband for breakfast. The backyard garden is really nice combo or indoor outdoor and wasn't too cold - they also had heaters as well. It's a really nice space with good staff. The food however just wasn't all that. I ordered the avocado toast which just seemed to fall flat. It's sliced avocado instead of the spread style I'm accustomed to for avocado toast. My husband had the salmon eggs Benedict and he also said it was okay not great. Just seem to not be as flavorful and delicious for some pretty simple basic breakfast dishes. On a positive note they have bottomless mimosas which is great but would have been better if the staff came around more frequently to make it worth your while.

The party was all grey with no char or color on it, also unseasoned and very wet. It was on a super soggy bun falling apart. For $16 this was a terrible burger and I will bet anyone $$$$$ that it is 100% NOT Kobe beef as described, no way in hell. The meat tasted like some old chuck blend from Associated Supermarket. The worst part was it was so soggy and falling apart it couldn't even be cut in half and eaten I had to cut it up and try to eat it. Mixed greens on side has barely any dressing but has a funk to them like they were never washed. Overall $30 for burger and mimosa was a huge waste.

The fries were seasoned with Cajun and a light crisp. The chicken alfredo looked well done, and chicken were evenly distributed to the pasta. It was eaten within 10 minutes!!

The wine was fair  The one exception was the grilled octopus which was very tasty and Cesar salad was ok. The meal went downhill after that. The Bronzino was supposed to be grilled but it was clearly fried first then grilled because we did see grill marks on it. It was very overcooked. The chicken parm was thick snd not tasty. They charged an extra $5.00 for paying by credit card. The meal was not cheap either.

In a quick summary, it was a bit disappointing for the price they charge for (18 each). Refer to the photo. (1) carbonara - it was plain, somewhat blend, and thin. Lacks flavors and I could literally count the amount of tiny pieces of smoked prosciutto inside. They skimmed so much (2/5 points). (2) grilled chicken Alfredo - the chicken was dry, but ok, flavor is simple and alfredo sauce was thick and on-point. THis is the best among the 3 entrees i ordered (4/5 points). (3) Meatballs marinara - the pasta was tender, meatball was thick but dry and lacks flavor (where are the spices and herbs?), sauce was average (3/5 points). OVERALL, they don't taste authentic at all, all boxed pasta, quite average Italian dishes for $18 each. Next timeI would spend more and get homemade pasta with better flavor profile.  Otherwise, the delivery was fast and the packaging was very good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Amanda R.,/user_details?userid=N3i3xlh09ofIcw-18kGThQ,"Patchogue, NY",4/30/2019,4.0,"The biggest appeal of Verde on Smith is their 2-hour bottomless brunch option. The restaurant is small, so even with a reservation we waited about 30 minutes to be seated. However, when we were, the waitstaff and host were very accommodating. They made us a table and moved us to a larger one when it became available. Once we were settled and ordered our food, we comfortably enjoyed ourselves. Verde on Smith is clean and classy. If it was nicer out, I would have loved to take advantage of the outdoor seating option. The meals and drinks were all reasonably priced for a restaurant in Brooklyn - especially the 2-hour brunch drink deal which was only about $20 per person (significantly cheaper than other options). They were very attentive to the drink refills - you definitely get your money's worth within the time limit. The food was delicious, but the portion sizes were average with no frills.

Only word of advice is... check the weather for the day prior. Unfortunately for us, we sat right by the awning and had drips of water hit every single one of us the entire brunch (moreso on 1 particular seat), which was very annoying. We mentioned it to the waiter and he just smiled at us as if we were speaking a foreign language so nothing was done at all. Our glasses were nearly empty the entire time, yes we had bottomless drinks but there were a few who didn't and relied on hydrating with water. As for the food, we all enjoyed the dishes and they were fairly priced. Another thing to note is I had ordered a side of bacon that came out way too crisp. It actually was burnt so I'd requested it to be remade. I also found myself extra hungry that day, although I don't think the dish was that small but I ended up ordering an extra dish.

Wenter B.,/user_details?userid=Jw9Flc1B1bWRo6mdU83zaw,"Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY",2/11/2020,4.0,So my boyfriend & I were dying for something to eat & wanted to try a different restaurant other than our usual. Somehow we stumbled upon verde. Customer service was on point. Every member of the staff made us feel welcome. For appetizers we had the calamari & crab cakes. Delicious. & we looove crab cakes! Now as for the entrees. I had the seafood linguine with the white sauce. It's like a white wine garlic sauce. Didn't really do it for me. The seafood was fresh. But for my taste the seasoning was sparse. My boyfriend however had the beef short ribs. When I tell you amazing is an understatement please believe me. You won't go wrong if you order this meal! Overall this place is great to check out. Would definitely go back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I new it would be down hill from here! I got the shrimp scampi and my BF ordered the seafood pasta dish. Both dishes lacked flavor! I I literally had to pack on parmesan cheese to get some flavor.

Best things about this restaurant were the kind staff and cocktails. Now for the bad - the partially enclosed back patio was cramped with people and tables were not 6 feet apart.

They didn't accept reservations and so I figured I would walk over and check out the restaurant and make sure that the outdoor seating would be acceptable considering it was supposed to be so hot.  There was a table that was inside but also  considered outside because the windows and wall were down. This table was perfect because you've got the cool air conditioning from inside the restaurant but we were also following the rules of sitting outside.  I asked the manager If I could have that table for the following day for lunch and explained the situation with my mom and that it was a special occasion.  I told him that I understand he doesn't accept reservations but I would gladly leave a deposit for the table.  He told me that it was not necessary and that he would make sure I had that table.

Mayliz P.,/user_details?userid=QW4qvGIBIxdV_Nwt0X3P0Q,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/29/2019,5.0,I came here to have brunch for a friend's birthday and I was not disappointed. $20.95 for 2 hours of bottomless cocktails is a great deal.

Jillian Q.,/user_details?userid=lZMsWrjJPJ_CEygn4y0F0g,"Huntington, NY",9/21/2019,1.0,Had a reservation for my friend's 21st birthday. We confirmed the reservation over the phone days prior and also over text hours before. Our party showed up on time and we were told the table wasn't ready and it would be an additional 30 minutes. It was actually more around 45 minutes when the table was set and there were the correct number of seats available. Drinks weren't anything special and the food was average. I ordered avocado toast yet they brought out a completed different dish for me. Won't be coming back here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nicolas R.,/user_details?userid=r6xQHzikoNn8aREyuuxG4A,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9/10/2020,4.0,"So OVERALL, this place gets a solid 8/10. However, it DOESN'T mean it wasn't a rollercoaster either. They at first give you bread which was nice (they don't toast it) and they give you the most skimpiest portion of oil and olives I've ever seen. I actually almost choked on a pit because the olives weren't pitted, and I thought they were. Can definitely see that as being an issue. That's not important though. The main course of the meal I get the Seared Tuna and the linguine, which honestly was good but could use some seasoning. It wasn't exciting at all. But what was exciting enough for me to comeback was the pasta and marinara. It was very good, sauce wasn't too acidic and had olives that WERE pitted (thank god) and capers which those all come together so beautifully. But what wasn't expected was the added protein to my dish; a f**king hair! Especially during COVID I was kinda scarred. However Yetis, the server was so understanding and nice. He brought me another plate free of charge, and it was delicious. For dessert I had the tiramisu which was to die for. The bill ended up coming to only $37. I'll be coming here again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Everything was very tasty and fresh, especially my rib-eye steak was simply outstanding! The portions were also pretty decent and filling. Finally, we had desert plates and some cappuccino, and it was an amazing finish for our dinner. Their homemade deserts are really so good, particularly we loved their creme brulee. You should definitely give it a try! Besides the great food, the service was very nice and friendly, which made our dinner so pleasant at Verde.

Monique M.,/user_details?userid=Fn-ox8NmUY7RBh0XelPpvw,"Bronx, NY",11/2/2016,5.0,"I returned here on a recent Sunday to indulge in the brunch. Luckily it was a beautiful day outside, so my friends and I were able to sit by the entrance and enjoy the view. The restaurant was loud though. About 8 women were there celebrating a birthday and face timing the occasion to someone. Anyway back to the important stuff. I ordered the delectable French toast with a side of sausage. It was soooooo darn good! The bread was fluffy and crisp with a hint of sweetness and beauty. I cannot wait to return for more. I also had a peach Bellini that was alright, it looked better than it tasted honestly, but I'm not much of a drinker. I will definitely return for brunch. I'm not sure if the dinner menu has changed since I last came, but I am open to trying it again. As far as service, it was great. The waiter and other staff were very helpful and kind.

This place really knows how to serve up a great brunch! From ambience to food to service, I haven't found a misstep yet! I was first here last month for my birthday brunch, and they treated me like a queen! My waiter was excellent! My husband is usually super hard to please, and even he really enjoyed our meal. He got the steak and eggs and I opted for the French toast. The french toast is delicious! One of my favorites all year, and I consider myself to be a french toast connoisseur. It's not an easy feat to be well portioned on thick brioche, yet not so thick that it's unpleasantly ""doughy"". They manage the right amount of lightness and don't skimp on the fruit. Loved it. My husband's meal was really well cooked and well seasoned too.  Most importantly, all the food was hot! Lukewarm food is a big pet peeve of mine, so Verde did not disappoint here. We both had the unlimited drink special (20 dollars for 2 hours) and I love that you can rotate through different deliciously flavored bellinis (mango,peach, raspberry), mimosas and Bloody Mary's. Between the two of us we tried all but the Blood Mary, and all were strong and great tasting! I went back again 2 weeks later with my family and again another home run.

Sarah L.,/user_details?userid=Ve38EmmBmaO9_nKajJ37VQ,"Newton, NJ",9/21/2019,1.0,"I made a reservation for this place for Sept. 15, for 13 people, and requested outside seating. I called a few days before to confirm the reservation and outdoor seating. 30 minutes before we arrive I get a text from the restaurant asking to confirm our reservation. As I was on the subway, I got the chance to answer FIVE MINUTES later. The manager then responded saying he had given our table to someone else. When we arrived at 2 for our scheduled reservation, the manager made us wait for thirty minutes. Then proceeded to sit us at a table not for 13 AND inside. I asked why we weren't outside and why we had to wait thirty minutes and the manager responded with ""you can wait another twenty minutes if you want to sit outside"". As someone who works as a server and has been a hostess, this treatment of customers with a large table and confirmed reservation was in all honesty BS. If it wasn't my birthday I would have left and gone somewhere else. Not respecting our reservation and being rude because they messed up was absolutely appalling and I am shocked that that man is a legitimate manager. 0/10 do not recommend at all.

She and most of the party arrived about 30 minutes after the reservation time...Yeah, can't blame him for his attitude. Every dish we ordered was good (steak and eggs, eggs benedict, Kobe burger, shrimp Caesar salad, salmon) and the drinks were excellent and a really, really good value. We had no issues with refills.

To be honest, I've never eaten anything besides the Smoked Mozzarella Panino, but that sandwich drives me to occasionally go to brunch by myself if I haven't been there in a while. The unlimited deal is pretty standard for Brooklyn, cost-wise (I believe it's an additional $18 ish), and has more drink options than usual since they offer multiple mimosa flavor options/screwdrivers/etc. If you intend on going after 1 pm or have a larger group I would recommend getting a reservation, but it can also be great to pop in for a spontaneous neighborhood brunch.

Katherine W.,/user_details?userid=oeFAs7AGJPXCHlwEX7GeCw,"Brooklyn, NY",4/12/2019,2.0,"I meant to write this review back in December when it actually happened but you know life happens. When I went here on December 22, 2018 I made a reservation for 2 people at 2pm, my friend and I arrived on time and were seated within 5 mins. Now I've always loved brunching here, the food is amazing and the wait staff are usually very attentive to the point when you do the unlimited drinks they bring you a fresh drink as soon as your previous drink is empty without you having to ask for one. When I came there that afternoon we were seated and ordered our drinks and food. Maybe 10 minutes later when were comfortable and chatting it up, the manager comes over to our table and asks if we would mind switching to another table because of a big party of people coming in that I assume didn't make the proper reservations of how many people would attend. My friend says okay before consulting with me and we move tables. They put us in the back of the restaurant, the last table by the kitchen against the wall, to say I was beyond annoyed is an understatement. When I saw another table across from us leaving, I asked if we could be moved because I didn't like our new table they said no, another big party is coming in. At that point brunch was ruined for me, the food didnt taste as good as usual and drinks werent coming as fast either. The manager didnt even come over and apologize or offer us a comp on fries or something from moving from our initial table. I just think the situation was handled poorly it was not our fault nor problem that the party that came in invited more people than they told the restuarant. I haven't been back since",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Not my first time at Verde and I can't exactly say it's a disappointment nor was it a total success. Unlimited drinks for $17 are definitely a huge plus but they could certainly use friendlier staff. Service was ... Not very friendly, impersonal, cold, and unwelcoming. The food was fine - don't have anything negative to say about the burger and eggs Benedict BUT they killed my bacon!!!! It appeared that the chef took four strips of frozen bacon, threw it on the grill, forgot about it, and let it burn to a crisp so much so that when pulling the strips apart you were left with crumbles.

Michael T.,/user_details?userid=sSFOSIn-lEfpAeZedWFT0Q,"Brooklyn, NY",11/4/2018,1.0,Let's start from the beginning. My partner and I wanted to have a nice brunch at Verde on Smith St in Brooklyn. It was anything but... We had reservations for 1:15 and wasn't seated until 1:35... The host seated us at a table that had stains on the tablecloth as well as glasses that was drunk out of... I kindly asked for a new tablecloth like everyone else had and he assumed that I didn't want a new one?! The waiter was horrible! It took him 20-30 minutes to take our order and another 10 minutes to give us our drinks... So eventually we was served and given our food. But when my partner asked for another drink the waiter boldly said your not finished your other drink so why do you want another one?! I was thinking oh hell no! I was about to say something but my partner held his composure and I said ask for a manager! So we talked to the manager and nothing was solved unfortunately... But as of now avoid this place at all costs! But I'm not going to let horrible service mess my Sunday Funday up!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Michelle Z.,/user_details?userid=g--rxe0o-e0vaKSMnj0nzA,"New York, NY",11/16/2015,1.0,"I am basing my review on the service because the food was actually very good. However, the service was mediocre to say the least.  It was three of us and for some reason they had to take ONE chair away from the table to make it a 3 person table even though it s 4 top table. They did it to another customer as well and he was perplexed.  So me and my girlfriends tried to somehow understand why they were doing this but the owner explain they were very busy - hello I am looking around there were only 4 tables being serviced how are you busy right now. Anyways, moving on - here comes our lovely attitude fill waiter who for some reason the owner defended when he should have been corrected. We told him we couldn't understand why they couldn't move us to another table - he proceeded to make a joke that was NOT funny saying ""well what is the problem I can give you the other table and switch and it still be the same table"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So I told him - well it seems he doesn't care about his tip.  He had an attitude and his name was Luis. They was absolutely nothing pleasant about him - I would have rather have one of the other serves which were REALLY nice. One of them brought us our drinks and he practically pushed him out to take the drinks from him. He was rude and didn't have any customer service skills whatsoever. As a owner you should be able to correct your employees not let them act however they want - your business is a representation of yourself and since you approve of him as a waiter you lost and will loose plenty of customers.  I do not recommend this place and will not go back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/verde-on-smith-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I've been to many restaurants on Smith Street and have enjoyed most of them, but I have no desire to revisit this one. The servers were overly attentive when I was waiting for my boyfriend to arrive but once he arrived, we had to grab their attention every time we needed something. We shared the roasted beet appetizer, which tasted OK but would have been better if served warm. I ordered the scallop and sea urchin pasta, which was what I expected, except the scallops were shredded and cooked in the sauce. Why wouldn't they keep the scallops whole? Seemed very odd and it left me wanting more. But the worst crime was my BF's dish: the tuna. The only reason he ordered it is because he read some good reviews about it, but what they call a  ""white bean puree"" was just a bland mush of undercooked, underseasoned beans. There is no way this dish is worth $24.
