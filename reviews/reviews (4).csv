I opted for the bird's nest since the bartender said it tastes the least like alcohol compared to everything else on the whole menu lol. It was pretty good and very sweet, not one of the best drinks I've had but in general I liked how creative the drink menu was! Especially as a Chinese American recognizing a bunch of cultural references in the drink names, and the unique Chinese ingredients that are mixed into the drinks. In terms of food, I liked the truffle mushroom salad the most bc the flavors were on point. Pork belly was okay to me, I felt like the portions were way too small and could have been more tender. Crab fried rice was solid though!"

My boyfriend got the burger which comes with fresh mozzarella and an egg on it, for 15 bucks. Doesn't come with fries unless you pay an extra 6 bucks. The burger was amazing tho.

Nice atmosphere  though, good servers, and you can tell they use high quality ingredients  and put thought into their dishes. I'd be interested in trying the lamb, fish, or maybe pasta.

I'm legally blind and it was absolutely impossible for me to see the chalkboard menu, I told this to the waitress who very kindly read out the menu to me, but I really think they should at the very least provide a print out menu.

From what I can surmise, the menu changes based on what's in season. Most plates are meant to be shared so that is what we do! Our most recent visit was this past Sunday August 5th. We sat at the bar. The bartender was basically perfect at his job. Friendly and welcoming. Informative and charming. We got the Empanadas (incredible) the cheese and zucchini in truffle oil and on the bartender's (spot on) recommendation, we ordered some toasted garlic rubbed bread to build the most insane tartines ever! We had the shrimp and Spanish rice. This was really good, the only note was the shrimp was a touch on the ""fishy"" side but I'd probably never have noticed except that everything else was so very superb.  Finally we split the burger with crispy egg.

Maite thus far has been the only place with the level of sophistication I was hoping I'd come across. Yes the price points are higher than most of the other restaurants, yes the chalk board menu does not help if you're with a large group or older folks ( hey gotta take mom and pops somewhere when they come to visit ) perhaps the gnocchi was too small of a portion for some other reviewer. ....but as someone who worked in hospitality for 15 years can attest to....those deliciously  overly plump little mixtures of cheese and potato? Dough were beyond perfect and soft with coli flower that's charred just right swimming in a pool of some kind of stock, wine? and shallot sauce was absolutely fine for my fat ass.  I am not wealthy...but if you can drop as much money as these kids do on drugs and booze around here you could enjoy a very well thought out and executed meal every now and then.   Support the uniqueness of all the different venues in the area and if you don't like it move on to the next!  God knows there is plenty to go around.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/maite-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The burger was tasty but didn't make up for all the other things. The price and service were my two biggest issues.

Everyone at my table thought their food was pretty good it was just so overpriced ($30 for a small serving of halibut, $26 for 4 ""wild shrimp"") for the service and environment the restaurant provides. A restaurant charging this much for food really needs to be on point service wise and this place is not. The bartender was more attentive to our table than our waitress was and there seemed to be some drama in the kitchen and it was very apparent to everyone dining. Just not the vibe I was expecting.

I ordered a hamburger and about 5 mins later asked if it came with anything........no......so proceeded to order fries to go with it. Probably a good idea to convey the fact that the burger comes with nothing when ordering. The hamburger (also quite small on a non descript bun) is $15 and now they want me to spend another $6 for fries....hmmmmmm. The fries were then brought to us 5 minutes later without the burger which showed up about 15 minutes later.

I am pescetarian and could not eat this, so with much effort waved the server down to tell him this and was incredibly apologetic because I hate to do that sort of thing. I explained that what I got was not what was on the menu and that I couldn't eat it. He seemed agitated but agreed to take the dish and replaced it with the gnocchi after suggesting a few things. After I got the gnocchi it was impossible to get his attention to come to our table even to get a refill on drinks. I am a server myself and understand having a full section, but most of his section had cleared out and it was apparent he was being intentionally neglectful.

The ramen broth and noodles didn't have much flavor, but I did appreciate that it wasn't overly salted. It came with 2 pieces of sweet, thinly sliced tofu skin. I enjoyed the tofu skin (although it did verge on being too sweet) and wish it came with more! The marinated ramen egg is always my favorite part and was well-done here too.

Both the salad and ramen were delicious! I was pleasantly surprised that the salad tasted fresh, though I'm sure it wasn't house made, I still enjoyed it. The ramen was hot and spicy. My biggest complaint is that ""extra egg"" should just be a whole extra egg...I have to pay extra so I can get a while egg... which was the right move because if I didn't I would have gotten less than a half egg because it was cut symmetrical.

Amy L.,/user_details?userid=ai6Sb1iGQqJNh0w_Zo49Rg,"Toronto, Canada",7/17/2021,4.0,Stopped by Kuu for a hot bowl of ramen on a rainy NYC weekend. The place is pretty small inside but there wasn't a wait around 5PM. We tried the Tonkatsu Shio and Shoyu ramen and they were both quite good. The portion size is probably a bit bigger than your usual bowl of ramen and it even came with half an egg so value was definitely there! The broth was quite rich and creamy while the noodles were nice and chewy. I prefer a firmer noodle because the noodles did soak up some of the soup and it got a little soggy after a while. The pork belly was thick and tender with good flavor. All in all a great place to try if you're in the area!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kuu-ramen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Been here twice now (once during lunch and once during dinner) and I've had their shio ramen and spicy miso ramen. I quite like their spicy miso one  as it gives it more of a kick. Both times I've been here it's been quite packed but I've been able to beat the rush and I simply got lucky. It's not the best ramen I've ever had, but it's honestly not bad. ~$15/16 us per bowl of ramen. Tipping is expected at night though. So adding tax and tip a bowl of ramen cost about $29cdn, so it's not that cheap... but woe is the terrible Canadian exchange rate... sigh.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kuu-ramen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Celia W.,/user_details?userid=JdCBAiCr7TKjsavXAVyc3g,"Chicago, IL",9/5/2021,5.0,"A small ramen shop frequented by the younger clientele. About 20 seats, all high stools. Plexiglass dividers on the two tables. The ramen selection is good and all made authentically in Japanese Ramen style with a surprise vegetable to make it their own. The chicken Kara-age is authentic izakaya style, juicy hot and crispy. The noodles have Koshi (al-dente) and is properly Tsuru-tsuru (less-starchy). The egg and Menma are on the sweet side but goes well with the soup. The Kakuni pork is properly Horo-horo (flaky) without falling apart in your chopsticks. Under the current situation, the wait is short. If you are South of the Brooklyn bridge, it's a good place to go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kuu-ramen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
