Emma N.,/user_details?userid=kEFYvGOeyTQUnnCWeD51yA,"Arlington, VA",10/2/2021,1.0,"Made a reservation a week before, then got hustled out 70 minutes after the reservation with the check on the table and the guy saying he's ""so sorry"" but there are people waiting. There was no one waiting? And there were empty tables? And any restaurant that doesn't plan for 90 minutes per table at least is doing something wrong. This was our big planned dinner for the weekend and it is ridiculous to pay this much for a meal when you aren't able to enjoy the full experience.

But we ordered 3 dishes and ALL of them were so salty we could barely eat them. We've eaten Sichuan food all over the city, but never had an experience like this. I was afraid the chicken with pickled peppers might be too spicy, but it wasn't. It was painfully salty. Also, all 3 dishes (1 beef, 1 chicken, 1 tofu) had the same boring red bell peppers in them, no other vegetables. Left half the food, didn't bother to take it home.
