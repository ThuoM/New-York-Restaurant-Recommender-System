This cafe and casual restaurant combo has live jazz on Sunday nights and great happy hour deals. My friends and I stopped by for brunch after skating in Brooklyn Bridge Park. We waited around 40 minutes for our table and ordered coffee to start. They serve Devocion coffee here, which means it's strong, smooth, and hits hard. However, I didn't really like my B.L.A.T. The bread was over toasted, so that each bite tasted like crunching on a crouton. It was very dry and I peeled it back to reveal a quick drizzle of sauce. I asked the waiter for more sauce and he brought back a whole cup of it which helped. The sandwich also didn't have much bacon. The thin strips of bacon and meager amounts meant that most of the time I was crunching through a lettuce, avocado and tomato sandwich.

We ordered the 3 for 20 charcuterie board with truffle cheese, prosciutto, and parmesan. The board was very tasty -- the parmesan and prosciutto in particular had very rich, aged flavors. The drink had a nice presentation, and was extremely strong in a not good way -- the other ingredients in the cocktail did not come through. While the pasta presentation was great (the noodles were black!) and there was a decent carb to veggie/protein ratio, the serving was quite small and lacked flavor.

I'm a big fan of chocolate and banana so it's no surprise that my favorite was the chocolate banana flavor. The ube one had a very subtle ube flavor, the black sesame and tiramisu fillings were equally as good. The cream puffs are small enough so you can buy a few more to try and not be too full.

I especially loved the black sesame, since the flavor was really rich and strong. The strawberry one was solid, but I couldn't really taste the Sakura.

The aesthetics of this restaurant are amazing. It is super cute and everything is photo worthy. The staff were very friendly and attentive. We ordered a vegan breakfast banh mi and the fig jam egg sandwich. To note the menu online is slightly different than the brunch menu in house. The sandwich's are super unique with a cool combination of flavors, but it feels a bit too much at once in a bite. I wish the banh mi was a bit less oily like it was dripping every bite.

I was hoping to sit on the rooftop terrace but it was closed (not sure when they open it but they had outdoor seating in the front available). The ambiance is very cute & I loved the plates/bowls they used. I got the sangria to start with which I didn't like at all, the menu made it seem like it would have a fruity taste but it was tart and not for me. They also had a special rum slushee drink that my sister got which she liked and said it tasted like a pina colada. My favorite items that we ate were the mushroom buns and mushroom dumplings. Both were delicious and had unique flavors I enjoyed. My sister also liked the chicken dumplings which I didn't taste since I don't eat meat.

Jennifer B.,/user_details?userid=EvOtCC_KIcP9B4aIuk-scQ,"San Francisco, CA",2/1/2020,3.0,"Boyfriend took me to Monarch for my birthday dinner. The food was solid though pricey, which was to be expected in Williamsburg. The staff incredibly gracious and attentive to us upstairs when it was a few people and then even as the crowds grew on a Saturday evening. What really perturbed me though was the showing of a ""classic"" movie called The Good Earth (1937) that was essentially yellow face. Yeah, the white actors playing Chinese people won Oscars yet that doesn't account for the offensive display. We couldn't hear the film, thankfully, but we were right in the direction of viewing in the corner upstairs. Basically a front-row seat to something incredibly offensive. It'd be one thing if, perhaps, the owners were of Asian descent showing this film in mockery but I highly doubt that would be the case. Seeing that the owner often responds and he appears white that is even MORE disturbing to me as a patron and as a person of color to have to see yellow face alongside my dining experience of Asian food. Talk about appropriation. I think there should be way more respect for the diners and the food served to not show movies like this whether they're perceived as classics or not. That alone was enough for me to drop this to a 3-star rating. 4+ stars for the food but -10 stars for the lack of awareness.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/monarch-restaurant-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Fantastic flavor and texture. The noodles were also excellent, but I prefer food spicier so Jesse hooked me up with some chili sauce and Sichuan oil. Perfect. Finished with the yuzu pie which was like a key lime but less sweet and yuzu flavored of course haha. One of the best desserts I've had in years.

While the dishes doesn't necessarily remind me of busan, each plate was so good and bursting with flavor. The beef tartare had fried onions and chewy baby octopus bits with a sesame sauce. My favorite was the pork soup and glazed eel. The soup was comforting and the meat was so tender, perfect with some white rice. The glazed eel was crispy, spicy, and sweet but watch out for the little bones inside.

We got the scallop diy gimbap to start and it tasted so fresh and I loved the apple kimchi that went with it. We also got the yook hwe and the flavors were great but the portion was so tiny. The dol sot al bap was good but I probably wouldn't get again. The spicy pork and squid was great, super tender pork and crispy squid paired together was amazing.

The portions are on the small side for the price. They also give a complimentary salad. I would recommend the corn creme brûlée the most.

Jane H.,/user_details?userid=JDtDZAheLQ8WZWcFgBOAqQ,"Brooklyn, NY",1/27/2023,5.0,"Ariari is a new staple restaurant that features Korean food from the Busan region. I loved everything I ate here! The seafood soup was soothing and reminded me of a home cooked meal. My favorites of the night were probably the seafood pancake and soft shell crab. I know you can't really go wrong with seafood pancake but it was extra fresh, fluffy and crispy here. The soft shell crab was light and airy, paired perfectly with the sauce. I also recommend getting the octopus as a starter because it was refreshing. I would probably skip the sea urchin cream bibimbap next time, I found it lacking in flavor.

We sat down and ordered like bomb, the service was very fast and the staffs were super friendly. We got 5 dishes, they're definitely enough for 2 ppl. I also liked their cocktails, very cute and delicious, I like the Korean features in them. My favorite dish was soft shell crab, so juicy and yum. Only one thing I wasn't really love is the sweetness in pretty much all the food, I mean maybe that's the Busan flavor, I'm sure who love sweet would love the food, but don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the food and drinks, and we finished less than hour. Next time I'll make sure we have a reservation lol...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ariari-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Arlene W.,/user_details?userid=LrLRacy1XKJcWn7TbAKyWA,"Manhattan, NY",12/30/2022,5.0,"My friend made a Thursday night dinner reservation for ARIARI after seeing the dolsot al-bap dish on TikTok (lol), but I was happy to join after hearing it was from the team behind Palpal and LittleMad (both delicious!). Stepping through the door, I was instantly transported out of East Village and onto a train to Busan - the brown leather chairs, dark-wood wall paneling, and narrow street-facing window were clever design touches that created a handsome vintage vibe. With Busan-inspired seafood food I had never encountered, every single dish we ordered was uniquely umami and strikingly sharp. I loved the mak-hwe, which was thinly sliced raw fish (amberjack, yellowtail that night) served as ssambap lettuce wraps. We also ordered the lotus root salad, salmon hwe-muchim, spicy pork with fried squid, seafood stew, and pork soup. Both soups had harmonious layered flavors, and were comforting on a cold winter night. Since the secret of how delicious this place is already out, I cannot wait to take others to this new East Village spot and try the rest of the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ariari-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'm born in Busan and they really did an amazing job of recreating the dishes. The raw sashimi was straight from Korea which made me feel like I was actually in Korea. Other hot pot and side dishes like soft shell crab was the best fried food I had in nyc. From all the hot pots, I recommend the pork soup because it taste just like soup you will have in Busan.

Our whole experience was amazing - the greeting, prompt service, food taste/presentation, and vibes. They play really OG Korean music and the ambiance is perfect for a date or girl's night out. My top picks for the seafood were the salmon hwe-muchim and the fried soft-shell crab. We mainly tried to stick to the seafood items but the unexpected winner of tonight's meal were the chicken skewers. Soooo juicy, soft, and flavorful. They had so many fun cocktails to choose from and we ordered the Omija and Maesil. Perfect if you want something on the sweeter side. I loved that I felt full but the food didn't feel heavy.

The vibe and atmosphere is warm and inviting and the music is SO VIBEY, i love it. But most of all what took my breath away was ALL the dishes we ordered. Although I've been to a lot of variations of Korean restaurants, there's noting like this that comes close. The food is fresh, unique, new, and feels like I transported to Korea. The mak hwe - so fresh and the pairing with ssamjang and chojang is perfection. The lotus root salad and octopus hwe - the flavor in these are just amazing. The white kimchi on the octopus hwe goes so well together. I normally don't eat yukhwe but my friends ordered it and I tried it and it was SO GOOD. The fried dishes were great and the batter is so light with delicious dipping sauces. We got the spicy pork and grilled eel for the main and wow...! The grilled eel is my favorite and it's a must try. The dolsot Al bap goes without saying. It's creamy, has the right enough umami and can taste the creamy flavor of the uni cream. For the soups we got seafood and pork and you can tell they aimed to make these the star of the show. The broth is so refreshing and probably one of the best Korean soups I've had. For dessert, both the corn crème brûlée and bingsoo was amazing - loved the white chocolate on top of the corn crème brûlée and loved the consistency. The bingsoo was refreshing and the best way to end the meal. This place is alllll worth the hype. 10/10!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ariari-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The seafood stew was flavorful with a nice kick, and was light without being overwhelming. They gave us a huge lobster claw, which cooked to be the most tender lobster I've ever had.

Zoe C.,/user_details?userid=H9K5K1fXXFmVINg5U7RmNw,"Kahala, Honolulu, HI",8/22/2022,3.0,"Came here for my birthday a couple weeks ago. I love the ambience and location is great, however I don't think I've ever waited so long for a meal in my lifeIt's a new restaurant so I am sure they're working out some kinks but the service was wildly slow. There was about 3,000 servers working but no one was really working? We were in no rush and I'm not an impatient person but after waiting an hour for our first appetizer I was a little bit like y'all good back there? Food was okay. I ordered the fish which had a nice flavor but it was just a quarter sized slab of fish swimming in broth. I asked for some rice on the side to eat with it bc ur girl needs substance, but after 40 minutes of waiting I canceled it and ate my lil fish in ab three bites. Is this how the Williamsburg girls stay so fit? I also got the salad that had savory granola on top which was v weird and soggy. Anyway! I have no idea what I'm talking ab and I never write reviews but thought I'd share. I would come again bc I love the interior designers & drinks are good but I wouldn't come hungry lol‍",https://www.yelp.com/biz/cool-world-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The seared tuna small plate was soooo goooooooood. Katsu curry was also so rich and flavorful. I would avoid the pork belly which was a bit over cooked and uninteresting.

It is a small Japanese restaurant that we found last minute when I was craving Japanese curry. This restaurant was very cute. We tried their sake flight, beef tataki, chicken katsu curry and yakiniku Don. Everything was delicious. We both enjoyed the beef tataki, it had so much flavor and it was quite tender. The curry was so good just wish it had spice levels, none the less it was delicious! The yakiniku Don was a little sweet for my liking but still good.

Wailana W.,/user_details?userid=gEnzvwRpeGam6UBV66Wp1g,"New York, NY",4/26/2022,2.0,"The menu was promising but the taste fell a little flat.  Our group of 5 came for a bite before a show nearby.  Only 1 person had been there before but we were trying to find restaurant with a good variety of offerings for our group within walking distance of the theatre.  We each ordered a donburi and had the pork belly and edamame for starters to share.  We also had cocktails.  My drink was the yu-agari yuzu which was refreshing and tasty enough if you like yuzu. The sake menu is extensive so come here for the sake cocktails if you like sake.  The apps came out quickly but the pork belly was room temperature and I am not sure if it was supposed to be cold or not.  The pieces were very thin and small and although there was smokey smell to the app, the flavor was bland and the pork belly didn't have any melty mouth feel that you would expect from pork belly.  It tasted more like bland undercooked bacon. You have to dip it in the sauces which accompanied the dish on the plate.  So by the time you dipped the pieces into the mayonaisey sauce or the black kaimi sauce, the small plate was a mess.  The kaimi sauce was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't at all. It tasted like a plum sauce to me and I was wondering if they had made a mistake and put the wrong sauce on the plate. The white mayonaise substance was also off.  I wish I took photos but we were in a rush.  The edamame with peroncino while I could see a reddish sprinkling of chili pepper flakes/powder over the beans, it too was too mild if you were looking for something with a kick.  My una-tama-don turned out to be anago, which was specified on the menu given to us at the table but did not mentioned on the online menu.   An ""all natural eel"" is all it says online. So if you are looking unagi as mentioned in the name of the dish, don't be surprised if you will actually be served anago instead.  There is a big difference in the taste of the two types of eel.  I prefer unagi much more. Kind of disappointing.  My donburi was also tasteless and very soupy, so much so that we had to ask for a spoon to eat the rice.  The server apologized for not have given spoons beforehand. The eel pieces were generous but just placed on top, all curled up. It would have been nice if it were cut to more manageable bite sized pieces or flattened our like unagi so then we didn't have to bite off pieces from the large curls. It's not easy to break of pieces with chopsticks with slippery anago skin on. Because the donburi was so saucey from the ""broth"" which is something ""between a corn starched sauce and soup, I couldn't taste the rice which to me is an important part of a donburi. You should be able to taste the quality of the plain rice as well some of the rice with some sauce from the topping if plated well and in the right ratio of rice to topping. Instead, all the rice was soaked in a bland sauce.  The ""soft-cooked egg"" was nothing more than a raw egg cracked over the donburi.  Again, like the pork belly spp, my rice bowl was served at room temperature so the raw egg was just adding to more soupiness of the bowl because the rice was not hot enough to cook the rice. If the rice was piping hot and topping also hotter, mixing in the raw egg might have thickened and made the donburi richer and tastier.  It left me unsatisfied because the donburi wasn't served at the right temperature. I really had hopes for Benemon but didn't really find the food to be comforting as someone wrote or as I had hoped. For $21 for a simple donburi and $16 cocktail, it was not a cheap quick bite either.  The concepts on paper are enticing but the execution needs work.  The service was good but they don't take reservations on the weekends so plan ahead and expect to wait if the place is already full or if you have a large party. I can see why they don't take reservations because the place is small but as promised, they did seat my party of 5 quickly when everyone arrived because we all arrived early. Had we not been trying to make a show, I think my group would've loved to hang out a little longer but I don't think the place is conducive to lingering unless you sat at the small bar which only has 4-5 seats.  I would go to a more traditional Japanese restaurant for good donburi and katsu but come for the sake later in the evening if that's your thing and if you want a cozy intimate place for a drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/benemon-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We enjoyed all the dishes, but thought the sauce for the tuna tataki was quite overpowering which kill the natural flavor of the tuna. Also, the don was too oily to my liking. I definitely recommend the drinks. I had the white clouds and it reminded me of a milk foam tea.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/benemon-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Second.. we brought a cake over to surprise our friend for their birthday. Mid way through dinner the waitress asks us when she should bring the cake out.. LMAO.

Pay attention while you're walking because I almost walked right past it( they didn't have an obvious sign) The una tama don had nice meaty pieces of eel and was perfectly sweet with the sauce and caramelized onions. My friends aid the katsu don was really good but got soggy a little quickly because it was under the eggs. I also was surprised it didn't come with any miso soup or anything. The starters are really small plates but the potatoes and Brussels were delicious. I didn't really taste the anchovies, only Parmesan. I really like that the menus are on the side of each outdoor table because you can easily refer back to it, but it minimizes the amount of people touching it. The waitstaff is really sweet as well.

Benjamin B.,/user_details?userid=kVFo_IdWbM-sriAHKc0fxA,"New York, NY",10/13/2021,4.0,"Looks fairly low-key on the outside but a really lovely Japanese small plates bar. Maybe a bit less casual compared to a proper Izakaya but vibe is still pretty nice. Sake selection is pretty good and they have some preset sets of sake if you aren't really sure what you want. The smoked pork belly is very smoked in flavor, maybe closer to ham is taste than to bossam or kakuni. Really tasty but potentially not what you would be expect. Fried soft shell crab was crisp in pleasant way, I would recommend especially if you are drinking at all. Aside from the small plates, Benemon does a variety of curry bowls and donburi. I had the shrimp and anago ten don. The tempura was pretty good, especially considering this isn't a specialized tempura shop. The tentsuya sauce was a tad thick, not really great for mixing with the rice but goes with the tempura. Overall, not super pricy but a really nice spot to chill and have a quick dinner with some sake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/benemon-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The katsu could've been fried more and the curry sauce did not wow me. The unagi don though... that on  the other hand gave me a slap in the face of wowness. It was so good! I'm usually not even a eel fan but when I tried a bite of it I fell in love. I also got the beef tataki as appetizer and that was good too!

You D.,/user_details?userid=A1xP-tx4YtQoac--L7JbPw,"Newark, DE",9/7/2020,5.0,Here is my update: Now I understand why my last take out was awful. When you order tataki with Don，just ask the restaurant to separate your order in different bags or take your tataki out. Otherwise your hot meal will steam your tataki to well done level.

She got one with eel and I got one with an assortment of tempura. They were fantastic. It wasn't anything new or mind blowingly good, but just soooo comforting.

We chose this place since we crave for some Japanese food and seems they have a really good sake list. We ordered creamed salmon, beef tataki, my gf ordered Una tama don and I ordered the Tsukimi Tori Don. Their beef tataki is so good. It has the right balance of sourness in it so it makes you feel cool down in the summer hot breeze. Their creamed salmon is a bit too greasy though. We both love our Dons. Mine tasted more like sukiyaki with fried chicken it it, and my gf's Una don was great as well. However maybe due to what's going on, they don't have sashimi, so we didn't get a chance to taste their scallop sashimi. Hope they can have it soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/benemon-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

A few different options for food and drinks to choose from. Nice interior and exterior and a decent atmosphere but on the louder side. Decent service and speed but space is quite crowded.

I read the reviews and decided to order the highly-rated eel bowl for lunch. My one-star review is that somehow everyone failed to mention how the eel came with sharp tiny prickly little bones in it??? I did notice the eel was a little uncomfortable to chew on when I was at the restaurant but thought maybe that was my imagination. I also didn't want to seem like a bother complaining so I mostly ate the rice, egg, and the mushrooms (which were fantastic btw!). I took home the eel leftovers and it wasn't until the next day when I tried reheating it that I discovered it was just full of tiny, prickly bones! Definitely a choking hazard!!! Either way, be warned that there will be bones in the eel bowl so eat at your own risk. Very disappointed that I paid $25 for a dish full of bones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/benemon-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I don't think i can ever look at the donburi's the same anymore lol. They set the bar pretty high. The egg they drop on it is so silky and cooked to perfection. I liked their uma - mama don the best. Katsu don was good too and so was the popcorn chicken one. My least favorite was the beef donburi (it was a little on the dry side) and i must say their curry dishes weren't good. The curry flavor was super strong and nothing too impressive. Stick with the donburi's and their appetizers!

My don was really wet at the bottom and slightly cold. This could be because we came in a group of 17 and so it was really difficult for them to bring everything out in a timely manner. When I visited again yesterday I ordered the unagi don and was pleasantly surprised. The eel was huge and the sauce to rice ratio was great. I tried my friend's katsu don and it also tasted amazing. I would also highly recommend trying the shrimp tempura since it does not feel greasy at all and was really light and crunchy.

Wendy C.,/user_details?userid=l_Nq9zZ-Ks0ncDgSQ4tH8Q,"New York, NY",12/9/2018,5.0,"Walked in on a Saturday night around 7 without a reservation. The two of us waited at the bar for ~10-15 mins and were able to get seated after enjoying a glass of plum wine. One of us was hungry and the other wasn't too hungry, so we ordered two small plates and one bowl of curry to share. Everything was tasty and interesting. The black miso chicken was flavorful and tender, but a bit too saucy and salty for me. The walnuts added a nice crunch and nutty flavor. The creamy baked salmon was surprisingly very good. The skin on the salmon was crisped to perfection and the salmon was fully baked without being dry. The cream sauce added a nice flavor to balance that of the salmon. The winner of the night was the curry though - which at only $15 is a great deal for the amount you get. The pork katsu arrived in ""meat stick"" shapes, which was unexpected but interesting. The pork wasn't greasy or overly breaded. I love that it came with two radishes to complement the heaviness of the rest of the dish. Throughout the nice the service was very attentive, efficient, and friendly.

The shredded pickled radish on top added another level of flavor and texture to the dish as well. I would love to come back here to try more of their dishes! The service here was amazing and they always checked up on us to see if we needed anything but also never rushed us.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/benemon-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was really disappointed because the curry sauce was off, it didn't taste like traditional curry sauce.

That was a small thing though. Missing one star is because the desert menu is weak - there's no other choice but one - black sesame mouse, it was good but very small for the price (and when I asked for the menu they just told me what the it was so I never knew the price until the check came).

Stephanie T.,/user_details?userid=sV1wAPAhaQQpr_GXcNTFKw,"Town of Hempstead, Long Island, NY",8/5/2022,4.0,The food and drinks here were really good.  I really wanted to give this review 5 stars but had to knock one star because of the service.  When we first got there we were able to choose any table to sit at.  Then our server came over to tell us that happy hour was going to end in about 40 minutes so if we wanted to order we should.  So we ordered a frosita and a sangrita.  We waited about 10-15 minutes and still no drinks and it seemed like our server was preoccupied with something else that they had forgotten about us.  Another table had come in and sat down and somehow ordered drinks and got their drinks which led us to then get the attention of the host to ask where our drinks were.  They finally brought our drinks over but I don't think the drinks were correct.  She handed me my drink and said margarita and I was like no is this the sangrita and she was like yes. I took a sip of it and it was definitely a margarita. I couldn't be bothered with asking for another one after already waiting 15 minutes for our drink order that they just pour from a slushy like machine.  Maybe it was an off day as they seemed to have something going on - just wished that they were a bit more attentive.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/medusa-the-greek-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We tried the dip sampler which comes with enough pita for two but enough dip for five! If you order just for two, be prepared to save the dips to slather all over your entree (which probably comes with more pita) or just get extra pita and have a dip feast! I was floored by the black truffle fish roe spread - I wish I had a huge jar of it at home to put on everything. Tzatziki was nice and thick, spicy feta was rich salty deliciousness, eggplant was fresh and smoky, and the beet hummus was light and sweet. For entrees we got the lamb platter and the salmon platter - I ordered my salmon rare and it came out perfectly. Sashimi quality in the middle! And it was a huge filet with a nice layer of skin. For sides, I preferred the spinach rice over the Brussels sprouts - it paired better with the meat and you get a delicious dill and feta salad on the side anyway so no need for more veg! Also shoutout to the pita which comes hot, soft, and doughy in the middle - could have made an entire meal off of it.

Flamur C.,/user_details?userid=rKXltExJs9eHH2TwAMxDLQ,"Brooklyn, NY",2/23/2023,3.0,"I'm giving this place 3 stars because it didn't put me over the top to justify at least 4 stars. For me to give 4 stars it would have to impress me. This review is a bit complicated because it didn't come across as a totally Greek restaurant. It had a little Spanish flair to it. If you look at the menu it has Carne Asada gyro and platter, Lamb Empanadas and Sangria. All Hispanic dishes or descriptions. The food was decent not impressive. If you're going to be a certain ethnic food restaurant then be that all the way. It's like you have an identity crisis with what you're serving. I don't know if it's because they're trying to please too many people but if I go to a certain ethnic type of restaurant then I want to experience that ethnicity's food and no side tracking. Come to find out that the owner is the same owner of two other Hispanic restaurants in the same area. So I see where they get the influence from. If you're a Greek restaurant then keep it Greek. If you're a Colombian or Mexican restaurant then keep it totally Colombian or Mexican because that's what I am there for. To experience their native cuisine. The service was good and attentive, but again, the food didn't put me over the top like the Greek restaurants in Astoria.

I had the Hercules gyro, which contained American lamb, pork sausage, and chicken, and came with both marouli salad (so crisp, flavorful, and fresh) and fries.

And the waiting time was reasonable as there were not as many customers at that time. The amount of their fries and vegetable salad was big enough for 3-4 people to share. My dish was salmon with spinach. I cannot judge if it's authentic or not, cause I am not very familiar with Greek food. To me, it's just OK but not impressive at all.

From the start our hostess was very friendly and accommodating. Let's us move our table outside since it was so nice out and was easier to get a proper seat for the baby joining us. Drinks were solid for a brunch spot everything you'd ordinarily expect and done well. The dip sampler is great for a group good with sharing. A lot larger portion than I had expected so plenty for everyone. Fresh crudite and pita to dip with, we ordered extra cause it was so good. Personal favorites was the spicy feta and was pleasantly surprised by the black truffle Tamara. I normally don't like truffle but this was subtle enough to not overpower the tastebuds. My only complaint is I wish they had just a regular hummus as not everyone is a fan of beets and the flavor can be a bit much. For a main I went with the brunch gyro and loved it. So much flavor, and was able to use some of the remaining spreads to create some delicious unique bites along the way. Sooooo much food though.

Jessica E.,/user_details?userid=KZXxN9-lXSp14sVL_4fqbw,"Manhattan, NY",2/3/2022,2.0,I placed an order through a food delivery app for pick up. Food was ready upon arrival. Ordered the moussaka and the squid ink truffle infused dip with a side of pita and crudite which came with a small side of greek salad in two separate containers. The moussaka was underwhelming. The layer of bechamel was thin and lacked a depth of flavor and heartiness I expected. The squid ink infused truffle dip was tasty and I would have appreciated a bit more texture. It was well infused with truffle and the pita was a good pairing to that. The reason for the rather low rating is due to finding mold on the tomato that came with the salad. It was a big turn off and I could not help but double check and wonder about the food quality for the rest of meal. Really hoping it was an off day.

Denise P.,/user_details?userid=3F32Og8t4tWNEbSIMNWPQQ,"Dunellen, NJ",1/14/2022,5.0,"Seconds after entering Medusa's doors after midnight on a random Thursday night, it was absolutely clear that we had made the right choice! The wonderful smells quickly transported us to another realm! Brian, our waiter and bartender greeted us with enthusiasm... and upon our request, he quickly and skillfully crafted signature cocktails using our spirits of choice. He was great with casual banter and helped us make our appetizer and entree selections which where all out of this world!!! The stuffed grape leaves are served warm, and although I didn't ask to confirm, their texture and flavor gave off homemade vibes; absolutely no words for the grilled octopus! Absolutely melt in your mouth tender and well-balanced flavors. On to my entree, a classic mousaka which was nothing short of mind-blowing, wonderful presentation, fresh ingredients, and layers of blissful complexity! Bravo to everyone at Medusa for creating such an aesthetically pleasing space to compliment our spectacular meal... thank you, Brian for attending to us so well! We look forward to returning soon!!!

I ordered food from them for two people and  for the price I paid for, the portions were tiny. I called them and they said they would take care of me. I went in today to meet with the ""manager"" and they didn't want to do anything about it and barely would match the amount I spend. The front cashier guy was rude and told me he can't help me because they are busy. After speaking with the manager arif , they finally gave me some food complimentary. They were very rude and they even left the food outside on the floor for me like I'm a piece of a dog and told me to pick it up. SMH.We all want to support small businesses but not these kind.

Tzatziki sauce is good, not great. Mussel's were very good, and the Octopus was tender, but not very fresh. Lastly, The bathroom's do not have hot water, and I washed my hand's with ice cold water.

Not sure if any bios was owners will respond because I didn't see many responses on the page. You guys should be more active. I live in park slope and often find myself passing by places that seem so nice, but never have the time to sit and eat at them. I was passing by the other day and decided to come and eat some lamb chops. I was greeted by Juan and Lillian. (Both great people by the way.) Lillian was my waitress and was very attentive and nice. She was able to answer all my questions and trust me I had a lot. I ate the Lavraki which was so good. The one star was taken off for the wait time because I ended up waiting around 40 minutes for my food. When the waitress told me it would take longer for it to cook I didn't expect to be waiting there for 40 minutes. I then ate the chocolate mousse which was okay. I wish it was served colder and was a more lighter and creamy texture. As for the lavraki it was great. Definitely worth the wait. I really love the service here. I can't wait to come back.

The congee was served piping hot and the taste was clean and simple yet deep and with lots of umami. Although, I wasn't too hungry coming in, I couldn't pass up mushroom filled rice crepes.

We ordered a fish fillet congee, two rice rolls and warm soy milk drinks. The service was decent - our server informed us the wait time being extra long and made sure that worked with our schedule. We had a whole day to kill, so it wasn't an issue. The congee was generous in quantity, and with a few shakes of white pepper, it is creamy, smooth with a nice kick.

Kevino C.,/user_details?userid=xhfuSKgPK_28b6up2M73tw,"Quincy, MA",7/25/2022,5.0,"This place was wonderful! Staff were extremely nice and accomodating. We went on a Monday afternoon and nobody was there when we got there so we had immediate seating. Menu was also really simple and prices were outstandingly cheap! $6-8 for rice rolls and same with their congee. I absolutely recommend coming here on an empty stomach and ordering both a rice roll and congee. They were both superb! Dishes came out quickly and looked amazing! I got the dough stick rice roll and it was perfectly cooked. The slight crisp on the dough stick went perfectly with the unqiue texture of the rice roll. Paired with the soy sauce, you get a whole array of flavors that all culminate into a gastronomical meal. The congee was just as tasty with the perfect amount of flavor and simplicity to each spoonful. I've had a lot of congee throughout my life (mostly in the Boston area) and I am usually unlucky with what I get (sometimes too salty, too spiced, too bland...you name it); but the congee here is just right and reminded me of an authentic dish you would get right from China. The curry combo was a little too much for me but if you are able to handle spice, this would be absolutely worth it. $10 for the curry combo was the most expensive dish we got here but even that is still pretty great pricing. The toast with butter and condensed milk wasn't amazing but it tasted like what it is: toast, butter, and condensed milk, and that's all I'd ask of it to be. Such a great restaurant with great prices. If you are ever in Chinatown, this place is a must try!

Gosh the sauce is superb and every dish was like $6-$8. It's so good. I could eat their rice noodle dish all day. The rice noodle itself was sooooo soft it basically melted on your tongue.

Joanne L.,/user_details?userid=htJcrxtelar85UYX5OxkIA,"Washington, DC",8/6/2021,5.0,God I love this place so much! They specialize in Chang Fen and they are GOOD. I'd always order the shrimp and beef combo whenever I have Chang Fen but this one is on a different level. The beef was tender and soft and the shrimp very fresh and plump. The cabbage added a nice crunch. But the chives were the jewel on the crown IMO (yes I am biased and I love chives a lot) and what beat every other Chang Fen I've had. Got Yuenyeung as my morning wake-up drink and it did not disappoint. The aunties working here are super friendly.

Jennifer J.,/user_details?userid=mWip-mueoJlGygbVYCG6oQ,"Raleigh, NC",10/7/2019,5.0,"I simply loved my meal here. The congee with pork, kidney, and liver was a huge ass bowl of savory goodness, and the BBQ pork rice crepe my boyfriend got was a decent portion. We also got the mantou with condensed milk and curry fish balls. The mantou was hot and crispy on the outside. The curry fish balls were great in that you can taste the curry but its not overwhelming to where you can't taste the fish, and it's not the cheap kind (you know the kind that barely has any fish and is mostly flour?) I also got the HK milk tea and really enjoyed it's smooth texture and authentic flavor (Can vouch because I studied abroad in Hong Kong for a semester a few years ago). Everything was satisfying and at a good price (we only paid $22.75 for all of this!)

For someone who spent the first 18 years of my life in Guangzhou, China, Yin Ji has been an institution of local restaurant specialized in handcrafted rice roll. I haven't been able to travel to Guangzhou to taste it for a few years. Heard about the NYC Yin Ji so I figured it's a must-try when I was in town. From the second the plate of rice noodle roll put down in front of me, I knew I was in for a real treat as it looked like the real deal. And the taste of it confirmed my thought as well. I was almost moved to tears as memory of childhood and home rushed into my mind. The texture of the rice noodles and the favor of the fillings and soy sauce were all as close as they come to what I remembered. And of course I had to try the congee, which was on point as well! I could tell the owner and her staffs put their hearts into this restaurant and its outstanding food.

This place is known for their congee and rice rolls so I decided to order a few of each. The outside layer to the rice roll was so thin and tasty and I haven't had anything like it! The price was a little bit more compared to other places but it was definitely worth it. I ordered the iced soy milk and it was really smooth and silky!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/yin-ji-chang-fen-rice-roll-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I waited in line with friends for an hour to get some breakfast food. I ordered their fish congee and marinated beef, shrimp with chives rice roll, and Hong Kong Milk Tea. I wish the fish was softer, but at least it's boneless. I requested for no scallions or chives in my congee and said yes to cilantros, and they truly dumped a huge handful of cilantros in. That was quite an overwhelming amount and kind of took over the taste of the congee. I found it tasty otherwise though. Their marinated beef and shrimp with chives rice roll was not bad either, but was heavy on the chives. I also found their milk tea quite bitter but they do provide sugar at the table separately for us to adjust the sweetness ourselves. Another thing is that the prices for everything is more expensive than what you may find at a typical dim sum place. I spent $15 (pre-tax + tip) by myself on congee, rice roll, and a small cup of milk tea. Overall, food is decent but not enough for me to get on that one hour line again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yin-ji-chang-fen-rice-roll-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My group ordered the braised beef and the braised beef with shrimp. I liked the braised beef better. I feel like with the  beef and shrimp it was just too much filling.

So he figured it may have been one of  his loose teeth that may have fallen out. When he spit it out, it was this metal rotting looking iron piece! I am absolutely disgusted that this was found in my dad's congee. He could have choked or maybe gotten metal poisoning if that's even a thing. We are never ever coming back to this restaurant. It's overpriced and they gift you with many surprising unedible gifts in their food apparently.

Cindy X.,/user_details?userid=ITexFwPnl5GERIoYPVgCOQ,"Manhattan, NY",11/15/2019,2.0,"Sorry but this place was super expensive for just rice roll. Why would I come here when all the other dimsum restaurant serves the same thing and even better. The rice roll did not have a slight chewy texture, it was more like mush and the combination of beef, eggs and chive was weird. Good rice roll will be elastic and not mushy. And it was just too expensive. Not worth it and will not be coming back. The condensed milk toast was dried and stale and it was $4, come on now. $4 for toast and it was complete garbage. Pretty sure Ming sing or cha Chang tang has better toast. Also their fried dough with rice roll is extra crispy, didn't taste like it was fresh out of the kitchen, it tasted like they refried the dough until crispy and rerolled it. There was no dough in the fried dough just hollow and extra crispy. If you guys know what I mean when you fried French fries for too long and there's no more potato inside.

K M.,/user_details?userid=k-SXfRQcWu2ATWExLtYWzg,"FOREST HILLS, NY",9/24/2019,3.0,Tried this place because it is new. It's not that great - definitely not worth waiting on line for. It doesn't compare to Joes Steam Rice Roll and I like the Rice Roll carts on Grand/Bowery and the one on Elizabeth/Hester better than this place. They kind of rush/pester you to order and rush you to leave (kind of understand since there are people waiting) but it makes for an uncomfortable dining experience. We tried the rice roll with cruller and the cruller was dark brown - too hard - guess they had in oil too long. We also tried the egg rice roll with beef. The egg rice roll tastes weird - the consistency is mushy but a little rubbery. The HK milk tea was good though. They didn't have shrimp when we went (strange to run out of something so basic - can't you go buy some at the Chinese grocery down the street?) and they didn't have the Han Jin Bing - waitress said they ran out 3 days ago - guess it's not made on premise.   No line if you go before 6pm on Tuesday.

Anonymous P.,/user_details?userid=DmBs8YKG5iPs96kIAGaJzQ,"San Francisco, CA",10/31/2020,3.0,"Had high hopes for this restaurant given all the great reviews it has gotten, but was quite disappointed. Ordered the sweet corn, vegetable, egg and chicken rice noodles, as well as the chicken congee. I really liked the texture of the rice noodle, it was oddly comforting, but the sauce accompanying the orders, as well as the fillings, were all quite bland. The sweet corn noodle was canned corn that had been lightly sauteed and folded into the noodle. The egg and rice noodle combination didn't work for me, in both flavor and texture. The egg had been flattened into the noodle, so it was all just one glutinous texture.  Both the chicken noodle and chicken congee were combined with shitake mushrooms that were so overpowering in flavor, I simply couldn't eat them at all. Otherwise, the congee had a really nice gingery flavor that would have been perfect for a cold day.  I felt that there was no balance in the flavors of any of the dishes. Additionally, my digestion did not do well with this food. Not sure if it might have been the oils used in the cooking. Won't eat here again, but will continue the search for a good rice noodle.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/yin-ji-chang-fen-rice-roll-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

With so many good restraints in the area, this can be skipped.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Still, when it was time for us to pay the check, we were offered these delicious chocolates and were told we could take as many as we wanted! All was forgiven with the meal!

Alma A.,/user_details?userid=WmHoHO6o3Ji9yI2YqO2Eog,"Wiscasset, ME",6/26/2021,2.0,"*Salad & bakery* review only The traditional greek salad was just okay. I was expecting it to be a bit better. I really want to support this restaurant. Nice inside and music nice. I also got two baked goods on the way out. They have a lot of gluten-free items. The orange olive oil cake was good, a bit dry. The blueberry custard muffin was good but hit some burnt after taste. Overall everything could have been a couple of notches better the day I went (1st time so was expecting 5 stars based on what I read). I am so sorry I had to leave this review. It is just NYC is expensive for restaurants and I felt like I maybe could have made this better at home. I am not in the restaurant business. Also they have a bunch of imported greek groceries they sell. I will have to ask my greek friend about the pricing on them. Overall they have great concepts here. My review is only for the food and I am sorry about that. 3+ stars and I say ""wow so good"" right away when I'm eating.

Kristen M.,/user_details?userid=2YA2zn8Qh1sSB3rskiFW1A,"Floral Park, Queens, NY",10/20/2013,5.0,Ive been to many greek restaurants and this was the first that i loved! The appetizers were a small portion so you can get a few different ones and share so you can really get a good variety. The main dishes are not to big but just the perfect size you will feel content not heavy and full! The food is so flavor full its not plain and the flavor does not take over the food! The deserts are great and just the right size!!!!! I hate red wine i really do but guess what i drank 3 glasses of red wine it was amazing i loved it! I cant say enough about the food and the atmosphere the decor is so warm and inviting. I cant wait to go back. It should be on everyones list if they love greek food and a cozy romantic atmosphere.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

That said, came here with my family expecting the usual experience and it was pretty bad.  Started with the hostess telling us she needed the table back within an hour and a half, which ok I get it but not a great way to start. Then all of the food and drinks we ordered were not good (Greek potatoes were cold, looked like frozen french fries versus the usual round potatos, other food bland and not great, drinks watered down) and the service was completely cold and indifferent to the point where it felt we were inconveniencing the restaurant. They also forgot our main course. Then took forever to pay when they had originally put pressure on us to leave on time. The worst part is on the way out we asked to speak with a manager and the hostess said he was busy so we expressed our frustration with her and she was completely indifferent and said ""oh, probably because we're just busy tonight"". I'm sorry - not a good excuse particularly at these prices.

We had a 7:30 reservation and were seated at a high top at the front of the restaurant.  We were told we were being seated there so we would not be rushed because a large party was coming in at 9pm in the back of the restaurant.  At 9:00 the manager asked us if we could move to the bar because he needed our table for the next reservation.  We explained why we took this table in the first place (so not to be rushed) but he didn't seem to care.  He only offered to buy our drinks at the bar when we told him we didn't want to purchase another round of $15 drinks.  There are more professional ways to have handled this, especially after dropping over $300.  Too many restaurants in NYC so I don't have to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Meg G.,/user_details?userid=i_1yW708yWe-C64RZAz8mA,"New York, NY",6/18/2018,1.0,"I am uncertain how this place was so highly rated. We came here for our anniversary bc we wanted Greek food, but had a bad experience. The feta was bland, the olives were meh, we didn't get bread, the salad was warm, the waitress barely made eye contact, didn't smile and was very odd and unhelpful and would disappear for long stretches. The herb stuffed peppers tasted like a Midwestern version of Greek - it tasted like it was reheated from the frozen food section. We were seated without menus or appearance of a waitress for five minutes (we should've left) and it didn't get better from there. When I asked our waitress ""K"" why the salad was served warm she said it used to be served with ice cubes bc that is a Greek tradition, but now that it is warm outside they don't serve it with ice cubes. Please, someone, tell me what that means and how serving a salad w ice cubes is a thing that is appetizing. Maybe in Athens they can pull this bizarre practice off, but not at The Greek. Oh, they also did this strange thing - they replaced the silverware btw courses and put the fork and knife on these black cocktail napkins, like it's a high end place. It strikes me that these strange choices made by the owners or managers. I will say the runners were busting their ass. And my husband - ever the optimist - liked the spare ribs. I wish so badly I could get this night back, but I can't so all I can do is warn the next person to avoid this place at all costs.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The decor was nice and the menu looked good so we stopped in. The first issue was the drinks we ordered, they were made incorrectly unfortunately, our waitress was MIA 70% of the time so we just drank them as they were, however considering they were $14 each I wish they had been made correctly. The main issue I had was our food took over and hour to arrive. A salad, a sandwich and the chicken screwers were ordered, the restaurant was dead and it still took over an hour (I know this because I got a phone call after we placed our order and while waiting I checked the time the call came through and it had been an hour). The waitress wasn't rude but we didn't really get checked on and waiting over an hour for food is excessive. I would have cut them more slack if the place was crowded but as I stated it was dead. The food was good, the prices were not bad but not good either, it's on the high side for what you get.

We waited a long time to even be served water and had to ask the hostess to go locate our waiter after he disappeared without taking our drink order.  When he finally returned (quite some time after the hostess went to find him) he was completely unhelpful at answering our questions and bordered on rude.  We ordered the spreads, the horiatiki and the Branzino.  The salad and spreads came out quickly.  The spreads (tzatziki, smokey feta, eggplant and trout) were all delicious as was the grilled seasoned bread that came with them.   It is a good sized portion for two people.  When the horiatiki came we noticed there were ice cubes in one corner of he bowl as if the waiter had spilled a drink into it and still served it to us.  We repeatedly tried to get his attention to point this out but he was impossible to call over.  We finally ended up picking them out.  This said it was a really tasty, well-balanced greek salad.  Once our apps were cleared we waited a LONG time for the Branzino.  When it came out it looked beautiful but was served with a very small portion of vegetables ( like four spears of asparagus and a couple broccolini leaves).  The fish was nicely deboned and perfectly cooked but a little lukewarm.  The vegetables were also well cooked but completely cold by the time they got to us.  For how expensive this place is (pricey even by Tribeca standards) it is not worth it.  The food is good and well cooked and the space is great, but once you factor in the portion size and terrible service isn't really worth the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Not too oily and cooked in a clay pot. You could taste the different ingredients and I think it may have been better than the one I had in Athens. Baklava was good, but I really want to try to Feta Cheesecake next time. They also gave us 2 different kinds of chocolate from Greece with our check which definitely distracted us from the prices.

Christina I.,/user_details?userid=XY_V0x09kIgYzkRqyomIFw,"Weehawken, NJ",1/21/2017,1.0,"I'll start off by saying that this place for food and esp service SUX!!!  I would've given it zero stars if possible.  We were a group of 5 that went for my brother's birthday late one sat evening.  I found the restaurant on yelp and saw the reviews so we decided to try it.  We got there about 10.30pm and they supposedly closed at 12am.  We started off by ordering a bottle of white wine that we had to ask the waiter when he was as delivering it as the appetizers had arrived.  Mind you the bar was right in front of the high top tables we sat at.  We ordered appetizers mainly and one main meat dish.  Only 3 of us were eating as the other 2 in the party simply joined for drinks.  The appetizers were horrible and tasteless. The only decent one was the croquettes.  For the main dish we ordered the lamb chops. Let's start off by saying they were cold, tasteless and flavorless. Since 4 of the 5 in the group are of Greek decent and one straight from Greece we know what Greek food should taste like.  During dinner we asked the obnoxious bitchy hostess/waitress if she was Greek and with a snotty tone she responds in English ""yes I am"".  I've never had a fellow Greek speak to me in such a manner ESP if you're of the same ethnic background.  On to dessert- the recommended feta cheese cheesecake was old and dry. The double Greek coffees were sooo sweet we sent them back for new ones esp since we asked for medium which is generally a hint of sweetness.  For all this garbage food it cost the 3 of us about $95 with tip.  A few weeks later I call the manager to complain of our experience.  He apologizes and asks that we visit again and he will personally ensure us a great experience.  So I should spend money again there I ask??? Doesn't even offer a $1 comp and he thinks I'll come back to try it again??? I wouldn't spend another $0.01 there let alone a $1.  This place is NOT only expensive, the service sux and the food is garbage!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Matt M.,/user_details?userid=7ztpeaeAJQW59VXrvsF45g,"Newark, NJ",11/15/2014,5.0,"What an amazing dinner!! First off I have to say I am a huge fan of Mediterranean food and this place could be my new favorite. We ordered Feta Psiti as an appetizer and it was insanely good. The feta is fried and served with honey drizzled over top, which amplified the flavor! When it came around to the entree, we decided on the Mixed Grill for 2. It was a great array of skillfully marinated and cooked meats with greek fries/chips. I honestly couldnt decide which  meat I liked more. We ended up ordering Tsasiki sauce to go with the mixed grill but I didn't realize it would be $6 charge per small bowl. Either way....the meal was great from start to finish!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greek-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ilias G.,/user_details?userid=LLOlTBOxTTtteLnnKuCeQQ,"Manhattan, NY",4/18/2016,5.0,"In order to be honest the Greek's ""Greek"" elements are mostly their wine list, some sense of hospitality giving free ouzo while you are waiting. Food is good but a bit overrated for my first full dinner visit (before I 've  only been at the bar) The ambience is absurd because it tries to be warm, cosy, industrial, and the result is a salad of badly combined ingredients. The remembrance is chaotic and reminds nothing of the restaurant's name ""Greek"". You don't need the stereotyped white and blue, but somewhere somehow the unique feeling of Greece. The patrons are the kind of people that apparently only know the generic kind of food and its byproducts that are presented as ""authentic"" or high cuisine in Manhattan. My experience was horrible due to the young Greek waitress one of the many that have arrived in NY after the Greek economic crisis. They have never tended tables before especially in America so they have limited capabilities and an attitude that is between don't push me too much, I am only doing this for some time. However because of the management's move to take the bill after what happened I am giving them five stars and I hope to return because their effort despite all the faults that I described above and they are according to my own point of view (that is not infallible) is worth supporting.

We ordered the Shanghai soup dumplings and the pan fried shanghai soup dumplings. I'm used to getting 6 or 8 in a portion so it was strange to me that it was only 4 for a portion. The pan fried soup dumplings were something I never tried before, so my group was excited to order it. The bottom was crispy, but the filling was unfortunately lukewarm at best and the dough was thicker than one would expect for Shanghai dumplings. The steamed soup dumplings were hot and flavorful, but again the dumpling exterior was more doughy and not the expected light and thin exterior so that threw me off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Yvette M.,/user_details?userid=6fx_GzF4Os4-hLmaYREvbw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/20/2023,1.0,"Yesterday evening my husband and I decided to come here for dinner and drinks. We chose this place since we were in the area. We wanted to try a new restaurant that wasn't too busy. When we walked in, there were about 3 or 4 small groups dining. The other half of the restaurant was empty, and that's where we were asked to sit. One of the female employees immediately handed us our menus and served us water. The other female employee was taking table orders and chatting with customers. After about 5 minutes, we were ready to order. We waited and waited, and waited some more. We looked around, made eye contact with both employees, but no one ever came over. After a few minutes, the employee who had served us water approached our table only to refill our glasses and walk away. We decided to give the staff additional time so I went to the restroom in the meantime. When I came back, I learned that the server still had not come to our table. We had waited a total of 25 MINUTES before deciding to leave. In addition to service being is terrible, the restroom smelled very filthy. This lack of cleanliness was definitely the deal breaker. That's when we decided that we needed to leave. All of this was a definite sign that we were not meant to eat there. Having two customers wait that amount of time shows how inconsiderate and unfriendly the staff can be towards their customers. Don't come here. There are better places with better service in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Alice B.,/user_details?userid=EvZKKXLeqZDT2I8hZJ_zAA,"New York, NY",4/24/2022,5.0,"We randomly stopped in here one Sunday afternoon after seeing a sign advertising their pork xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings), which is a treat I can rarely pass up. Of course we ordered a few sets of the dumplings along with the Shanghai salted meat with vegetable rice and the dry-fried green beans with pork. We later ordered the crab soup dumplings just because we could! Each dish was delicious. Next time I plan to try the other signature dishes. I have a feeling you can't go wrong ordering from here and this is your chance to get a taste of cuisine from the Jiangnan region of China (the menu mentions several cities in the region including Shanghai and Wuxi). They offer other more well-known dishes like kung pao chicken and orange beef, which I'm sure are very tasty, but I think before I went for those I'd like to try the Wuxi Pork Ribs and the West Lake Fish.

Frank A.,/user_details?userid=9s7AurWtJa3iV_h-gN2QGQ,"Manhattan, NY",7/31/2019,3.0,"Tipsy Shanghai is the New York sibling of a restaurant in Shanghai that was started in 1905. So with that history you would expect amazing flavors and unique Shanghai dishes. Unfortunately, the food at Tipsy Shanghai can only be described as bland and some of their menu items are more American Chinese (shrimp with lobster sauce, sweet & sour chicken, etc) than truly Chinese. The restaurant itself is very nice and the service is good, but the food is simply bland.

However it was actually a disappointment. The noodles taste ok but we waited one and half hour for the delivery(which is also annoying), so as you can imagine, all noodles stick together and became a soggy pancake. The ribs and zongzi are both very disappointing. Sour taste. Feels like they are spoiled. Our favorite is the sweet sticky rice. It has the right amount of sugar and well balanced with red bean paste.

I'm so happy I found this restaurant, and will definitely visit it again the next time I'm con the area! The only unfortunate drawback is the minimal options for vegetarian and vegan diets. Nevertheless, our server was very helpful and the kitchen altered a couple of items into vegetarian dishes. The stir fry green beans are absolutely fantastic and spicy, with that ""kissed by the wok"" flavor essential to this dish.

But aside from an interesting retro decor, good service and having many authentic items, the food tasted very bland and lacked any serious flavor. Both the pan fried xiaolongbao and the shredded bean curds (tasted pre-frozen?) in chicken and shrimp broth didn't really hit home for me and were very unimpressive. The pork ribs were just okay because many of them are the tough, dry pieces of meat not attached to the rib bones. The presentation of each dish, however, made them slightly more appealing but the taste is very average for Shanghainese food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Right off the bat, the place looked really cool. It was colorful and bright and the design felt thoughtful and appropriate for the cuisine. The menu was a bit of a mess to navigate, but we found the dishes we wanted. We got soup dumplings, salted duck, pork rib soup with radish, bok choy with tofu skin and osmanthus flower with rice ball dessert. The price of the food is way more than I would normally pay at a restaurant in Chinatown, but the flavor and service at the restaurant made up for it. The soup dumplings were hot and juicy and had a hint of sweetness to the soup. The duck was clean and easy to eat, minimal mess with the bones. The rib soup was just like how mom makes it, so extra points there and the bok choy with tofu skin was fresh and clean too. Our waitresses were also on top of the water, warm lemon water, perfect for the cold day outside.

Sereen G.,/user_details?userid=ZhlXmmpYNq6eyRVOBCnOxw,"West New York, NJ",9/17/2019,3.0,Tried silky kitchen for the first time. I ordered S1 - Stewed Beef with Dry Mix Noodles and medium spicy. This place is very efficient. I got my food less than 10 mins after I ordered it. I have to say that stewed beef was very flavorful and good but what kind of noodle do they use? It felt like a bouncy spaghetti noodles. I really didn't appreciate the texture of the noodle. I thought it was all hand made? I don't think noodles were hand made. Don't think I will be returning to this place anytime soon..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/silky-kitchen-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The noodles are around $10-$20 which is not bad at all, the portion of the noodles are quite large. If you don't like noodles you can substitute to rice or vegetables. There are a variety of different kinds of flavors to choose from including chicken, beef, pork and vegetables. I had the vegetable noodles and my friend had the chicken noodles, it seemed like his came out spicier than mine although we ordered the same level of spicy.

Every single item we ordered was a fresh, vibrant, and delectable experience! We started with the soup dumpling sampler combo, the truffle dumplings were the truth! They were delicate and just the right size. Next we shared the Cha Chiang Mein, it was savory with the perfect chew and hit all the right notes. The watercress with enoki mushrooms was a symphony of flavors and an unexpected winner. I'll need to get this dish at every meal here, going forward. We finished up with the Dai Pai Dong rice, which had shrimp and Chinese sausage, it was very satisfying.

The quality of the food was okay ; Definitely not delectably out of this world and not the polar opposite, feces on a platter.  The ambient concept was suppose to be a ""hip and classy"" vibe but the place provided ""empty energy"" and was a bit vacant and desolate.

There are so many Mediterranean restaurants in the city that can serve as great tasting food as this one. However, this is the one that ruins your experience with their operations, services, and to top it off, with the manager. After our meal, we went through 40 minutes of 5 iterations of bills as they could not figure out the exact charge for our table. And when the manager finally came out, she was extremely arrogant and her first question (not an apology!) was, ""there is only $1 overcharge we did on your check, what is the problem here?"" although this was after their 3rd bill that overcharged 4 more drinks!! So it really did it for us. When she added further to say ""we have 2 servers covering all tables so there can be confusions but this is how all restaurants are nowadays"" we were thrown off at how arrogant and unprofessional she is as a manager.

You could taste slight bitterness of the matcha powder, which is good and authentic. Now comes my biggest gripe. The texture of the rice used in onigirazu is not soft nor sticky enough that would supposedly bond all the ingredients into one harmonious ball! I understand that you are not supposed to squeeze the rices in onigirazu. Nevertheless, It seems the rice were left in the rice pot overnight. This would have been perfect to make fried rice but not acceptable for onigiri. Because of that, the whole onigirazu falls apart when trying to bite into it and making a mess all over. In my opinion, I would not give a passing grade to it.

D R.,/user_details?userid=VJ7XcKo3sT2vrdh4uK-IPQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/9/2022,5.0,Tokuyama is the best kept secret in the East Village. It's tiny so it's very easy to miss but the onigirazu are so delicious. The staff is extremely nice and we go there almost once a week with our dog and eat outside. Only downside is it takes forever so definitely place your order in advance. However it takes a while because each onigirazu is made by hand and is very well balanced with just a hidden bit of wasabi and you can tell they are made with care and patience. 10/10 definitely get their blue moon milk as well it's soo good and their chai!!

Lucy R.,/user_details?userid=BbZdS65KPZC3OeNruk2jLQ,"Bronx, New York, NY",10/11/2018,5.0,"Went for my usual coffee run and found out they now have Matcha scones and muffins! They're vegan and taste delicious. I personally like the muffin more as it's perfectly paired with banana, which gives it the right amount of sweetness. Their new addition did not disappoint!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tokuyamatcha-and-onigirazu-bar-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kristine S.,/user_details?userid=5b6tY2FwO8CMuNvmKkwuAQ,"Oakland, CA",8/22/2018,5.0,"Stumbled upon this adorable gem one Saturday afternoon. Tucked away in one of the side streets of Alphabet city it's truly a charming little spot. Jun, the barista was welcoming and offered friendly conversations. Above all, the coffee was great and so were the lattes! If you're looking for a quiet and relaxed place to meet with friends or catch up with work visit Tokuyama!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tokuyamatcha-and-onigirazu-bar-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Anna L.,/user_details?userid=NbeDUg8p2S8r8A3HJg3EZA,"Manhattan, NY",8/4/2018,5.0,"I love this gem of a spot! It's super cozy and cute inside. Although it is a small space, I still enjoy how relaxing and lovely the cafe is. My favorite drink is the iced matcha latte which tastes super authentic and refreshing. I replace it with almond milk because I don't consume dairy, but it still tastes delicious. I usually go on the weekends when it gets a bit busy but the barista is still really friendly and accommodating. I definitely want to try the pastries next time as well!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tokuyamatcha-and-onigirazu-bar-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
