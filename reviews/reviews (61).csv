Rebecca Q.,/user_details?userid=A2rzGOj90-heYsSmU5jmrw,"New York, NY",12/12/2022,4.0,"Bright, Australian brunch spot in the heart of Soho! The inside is small so definitely make a reservation if you can. I got the purple sweet potato latte, the whipped mascarpone banana bread, and the seasonal scramble. I would probably skip the latte, it was lukewarm and tasted pretty artificial. The ribboned eggs on the seasonal scramble were done well, but the toast itself may have been toasted too long...it was nearly burnt! The star of the show was the banana bread! The coffee flavored mascarpone paired deliciously with the sweetness of the banana bread. For $11 it is quite expensive, but sharing it with the table was more than enough for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/two-hands-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Matteo G.,/user_details?userid=MZuCISR1ssi5PlGrHeusrA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12/1/2019,5.0,"No wait and fast service at this brand new location on Bleecker Street. The menu is consistent with the other two locations and the food is always top notch. We walked in around 1pm on the Sunday after thanksgiving and we were seated straight away, mostly due to the fact that the majority of people don't yet know about the existence of this location. We had the banana bread ($10), which comes with a mascarpone spread on top. We also had the Build Your Breakfast ($10), which comes with sourdough bread and your choice of eggs any style, and optional sides for an additional $4-$5. We opted for a side of sweet potatoes, which were substantial and really good. Finally, we tried the Breakfast Roll ($15), which comes with a small side salad and is definitely worth the money. Delicious sandwich with scrambled eggs, avocado, and a slightly spicy tomato sauce. For drinks we shared a Match latte ($5), which was also really tasty.

Tiffany L.,/user_details?userid=Ei2f6sclQvm-uzi3Dks3Vw,"Chicago, IL",2/7/2020,4.0,"Originally came upon Ho Foods a couple years ago, but the waits were insane. We were in New York recently, and decided to have 2nd brunch here because I love love love Taiwanese breakfast. We got there 11:30am on a Sunday and waited 20 minutes for 2 people. There's like 11 seats total. The sweet soy milk was great. Perfect texture, not too sweet. The you tiao is a bit oily and extra crispy since it's double fried but goes well dipping it in the sweet Â soy milk. The Lu rou fan is normally at dinner but I think they serve it pretty consistently for brunch now. It's really good.

It's pretty easy to get to, about 10 minutes walk from the subway. It's a pretty tiny shop, and they've done an unbelievable job making use of the space - they have outdoor seating and several indoor tables as well a bar. We both got the beef noodle soup with wide noodles, and my boyfriend got the rich + spicy while I got the spicy. This was an absolutely phenomenal bowl of noodles! The richness and depth of flavor of the broth, the chewiness of the noodles, and the absence of fat chunks on the beef made this one of the best beef noodle soups I've had. It really reminded me of bowls I had in Beijing! They were also SO nice here. It is a little pricey (it ended up being $45 for both of us including tip, and we only got the noodle soup) but I don't regret it in the slightest!!

My gf and I walked in Saturday evening and were seated within 10-15 mins which isn't bad considering it's a tiny place. I felt that the regular soup noodle broth was packed with flavor and even had a slight spicy kick to it (w/o adding the spicy). I just wish they filled the bowl with more broth!! I almost felt like I had to ration my broth so that it would make it til the end. I got the wide noodles and added greens/tendon. It was all so good. The noodles were a good texture and didn't stick together like wide noodles oftentimes do. The service was great and fast. It might not look like it but they do have a bathroom, just ask!

I ordered the classic noodle soup with round noodle, and it truly reminded me of the beef noodle soup my mom used to make for me.

I agree with other yelp reviewers that it is watery; I would describe it as having a high ratio of light chicken broth to curdled soy, whereas I'm used to the base being soy milk. I think the savory soy milk here is okay in terms of taste, just not the savory soy milk taste I am familiar with from visits to Taiwan growing up. Despite the subpar dish, we had a pleasant experience with the staff. Servers moved efficiently and politely in the busy, cramped shop. We wanted to eat-in but ended up changing to take-out after learning of a projected 35-40 min wait. Our take-out experience went well - we weren't shooed outside in the cold to wait, and received our order in the 20-25 min estimate with spoons and napkins included in the to-go paper bag.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ho-foods-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Shanny L.,/user_details?userid=8C5D66xieBH25v87yTmImA,"Brooklyn, NY",11/30/2020,4.0,"Finally visited this place for breakfast in which the menu is quite different from lunch/dinner. Went in mid nov (actually rented Zipcar for this lol) I'm half Taiwanese so in my opinion, pretty decent food - just a tad pricy (well, it's nyc.. but hey this pretty close to what you can get!!). My favorites were the you tiao (fried cruller) and sweet soy drink (hot). The fried crueller was made to order, pipping hot, crispy and yet not greasy. Dip in the soy drink (how a local Taiwanese would eat) - Waahhhh life is good and felt transported to Taiwan. Perfect match like you might dip French fries to a frosty (Wendy's) or hot fudge Sundae (McD)? Anyway you can relate! The sweet soy drink was not too sweet / just nice and having it hot was warming while sitting outdoor. Note there aren't many tables (and no heat when I went) so go super early like when they open otherwise just wait a bit. When we got there, all tables just got taken so we put down our number and walked around and came back in 15-20mins. The waiter (young gentleman) was nice, fast and friendly. You have to order using their website so have your phone and payment ready but they will bring you out the food. Just make sure you put the table number (waiter can help you). For me, the fan Tuan is not the best I had (I think winson in williamsburg is better), the rice roll is too skinny and with the very crispy fried cruller just felt too crunchy and lack of soft chewy rice to balance it. Radish was a bit dense texture to my taste but not bad. Overall great and satisfying experience. Hope to come back another time soon one day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ho-foods-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We sat at the bar and it was a little tight but acceptable. The service was great, very friendly and courteous. We had two servings of their noodles. One with their stock broth and wide noodles and the second with their regular thick noodles and rich and spicy extras. Both were flavorful but the added rich and spicy provided more depth and is the obvious way to experience their noodles if you can tolerate a little heat. We also tried all the appetizers offer that day (cucumbers, tofu, and pork over rice) and found them very underwhelming. If I had to come back, I would opt for just the noodles but even then I don't see it worth the wait, especially not at their prices and the reported 1+ hrs.

Cathy L.,/user_details?userid=j7_BRZzlQPjOgEgVNotgSQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/30/2018,5.0,"This is legit, authentic Taiwanese food. The lu rou fan (pork belly over rice) tastes much like the lu rou fan I get in Taiwan at Du Shiao Yuen and some night markets. The meat to rice ratio is good, it all melts in your mouth without feeling overly oily. The niou rou mien (beef noodle soup) was yummy too. I enjoyed the broth more with the added spicy option, very flavorful. I personally prefer the round noodles over the flat noodles. This place only seats up to ~11 people (some counter seating and some small tables), but we arrived at 4:45 pm and were seated in the first round. I've been trying to find good Taiwanese food in NYC for a while now, and this is the best I've had, closest to actual Taiwanese eats. Ho Foods gets high accolades from this Taiwanese American girl.

We were able to get in to the first round of customer to be served. The food came pretty fast. The seasoning seems a bit light. It doesn't taste bad but it is definitely not comparable to beef noodle soup in Taiwan.

Growing up eating beef noodle soup as one of my favorite dishes, I had heard great things about this place and the authenticity of the restaurant. I came during their soft opening and came and waited 30 minutes before the actual opening of the restaurant. The whole restaurant seats no more than 16 people, and having JUST missed the cut off for the first wave of people to be seated, we ended up waiting in the cold (we came in February) for 1.5 hours to be seated. We ordered the tofu appetizer and the rich beef noodle soup. The food came up relatively quickly, and service was really good (server/cofounder was aware of the wait and trying to minimize/effectively get people seated and fed ASAP) however the quality of the beef noodle soup was only mediocre. I didn't think the broth was that flavorful (kinda bland) and the beef wasn't the melt in your mouth goodness that I'm familiar with at home. Overall, didn't think it was worth the 1.5 hour wait and unfortunately probably won't be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ho-foods-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Karen H.,/user_details?userid=0FsQtLORyP9yM1fqeZAhsw,"Clayton, MO",3/24/2018,3.0,The beef noodles tasted good. But I have to say it's a bit pricy base on the food amount.

The soft tofu and pickled mustard greens (suan cai) were also really good as well. If you want a ""lighter"" take, order the regular.

Heather C.,/user_details?userid=s1lmzddE7lsTVzZgVvvs6w,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",7/6/2019,5.0,"I don't write reviews very often because it always feels like too much effort. Ho Foods totally felt like it deserved a review. The place is tiny- three small tables and a counter that seats four people. That doesn't subtract from the experience- in fact, it adds to the atmosphere that feels homey. The staff was welcoming and very knowledgeable. We ordered all the side dishes (sans the turnip cake- that's for next time). The cucumber dish was just right and felt homemade. The tofu was great too (fair warning, it is a little salty). My favorite side dish was the lu rou fan. This is actually one of my favorite comfort foods, and Ho Foods nailed it. Most lu rou fans that I've had are full of sweet soy sauce. This one was less so, with a subtler but extremely satisfying taste. The pork is fatty in the best way, and it coats your mouth. I look forward to getting it as takeout. We got the spicy beef noodle soup with wide noodles. It was authentically spicy and the noodles were made perfectly. Beef noodle soup noodles should be just the right amount of chewy- and Ho Foods aced that. Our table also got a taste of the mi jiang- a sweet peanut rice milk that's served for breakfast. It was one of the best things I've had in a while. This is such a fun and quality place to go eat. It deserves all the good press and hype it's been getting.

Arielle R.,/user_details?userid=GL9ibQiipVeOCkbewxA_AA,"Providence, RI",1/10/2023,5.0,"My group just happened to stumble in here for a quick bite since we were waiting for the bar across the street to open (private event was finishing up). Omg, we were so blown away! The menu is based around their selection of dumplings, but you can also have them with kale noodles specifically. We ordered a sample platter that comes with one of each dumpling. However, you can swap them out however you'd like. One person in my group has a shellfish allergy, and we had no problem swapping them out for another type. Being able to try out their different flavors was really helpful, and we ended up ordering more of the pork and basil, which was our favorite.

Jennifer T.,/user_details?userid=IuMJ0E5G_FgQFsvdC7N6qw,"Sunnyvale, CA",10/18/2022,5.0,"I found this place in Yelp street my initial lunch option fell through and I'm so glad I stopped by. They offer Thai fusion dumplings with plenty of filling options-chicken, pork, shrimp, octopus. You can also choose a meal variation that comes with four dumplings of your choice, bok Choi, and kale noodles. I overheard someone saying it was their second day in a row getting lunch there and I can see why. I went with the chicken dumplings and they were so tasty, especially with the sauce. I can't eat spicy so the lady kindly offered to serve it on the side and I'm grateful because the chili sauce was quite spicy. The sweet soy sauce on the side was perfect to dip the dumplings in although they were very generous with the amount of sauce that came on the noodles. The kale noodles were a perfect side and I loved the chewy texture. The bowl was a perfect portion size for lunch and I'm craving it again already. My only wish is that they could offer the option to pick four different kinds of dumplings to go with the noodles because the only option I saw to try all different types is to get the party platter but that's 10 dumplings, which is a lot for one person (for me at least). Overall really tasty food, would highly recommend checking this place out. There's plenty of seating indoors and outside. Service was very nice and food came out quickly. PS spicy does mean actually spicy so I would ask if you're sensitive to spice like me. Luckily they have plenty of flavorful but spicy free options to choose from.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dumpling-n-dips-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Â It is nothing more than naan and some kind of sweet chili jam. The meati nuggets were a tad spicy and perhaps should have been made with the sweet chili jam from the bing.

Â Overall, the bites were a smorgsbord of ideas and flavors, some tasty where you want to eat the whole thing yourself and not share with your companions (e.g. potatoes), some where 1 piece was perfection (pork belly bun), some where you can't eat but 1 piece (meati nuggets) and some where the description and expectation were too different (bing) and the deconstruction dessert which was a disaster in presentation but you still ate it.

We ate off of the restaurant menu which is a great value because it includes a drink and two courses for $45 a person. I had the best iceberg salad of my life. Typically iceberg salads have no flavor but this one did. I really like the sesame on it. The Palmer was a lemonade and I love how green it was. Really yummy. The waffle was average. It could have use more apple and more flavor. My boyfriend had the chicken burger which was a really nice portion.

Nicole B.,/user_details?userid=QxJ2YrfZtHjXurI9m3h9qA,"San Diego, CA",10/28/2022,2.0,"I was really looking forward to eating at Momofuku Ssam Bar but unfortunately had a very disappointing experience. I've eaten at his restaurant in Las Vegas and have always had an incredible experience. With that being said, the food was ok but the service was awful. We made a 9:30 year reservation and received a call around 8:30 saying that we could come by earlier. We weren't able to so showed up a few minutes before our 9:30 reservation. We were rudely greeted by the hostess who seemed to be extremely upset that we had shown up so late (at 9:28 for our 9:30 reservation). I understand people want to call it a night early sometimes but don't offer reservations at this time if you're not capable of delivering on the David Chang experience. So once they begrudgingly sat us, the waitress comes up and says kitchen is about to close so you have one shot to put in all your food. There's definitely a more customer-service appropriate way to say that...anyways we ordered the ssam set which was overall very good. Drinks were also solid. The meats were all good and I really enjoyed the salad. The raw fish dish, hamachi I think, was a little fishy but the bing and salad made up for it. The meats were all tasty and the star of the meal. We ordered the oysters which were pretty standard but the $55 cacio e pepe rice cakes were not worth the price tag. You could tell throughout the meal that they were trying to rush us so they could get out of there, which really deterred from the experience. Once again, I know everyone is tired and overworked but we're pretty low maintenance so I just ask for a decent experience when we're paying to go to a nice restaurant. The subpar service really put me off to coming back to this restaurant.

Jane L.,/user_details?userid=_W1HZ_lW34YUjCIFIVrHFQ,"Queens, NY",10/24/2022,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this new iteration of Momofuku Ssam Bar. I was a big fan of the old location and appreciated how intimate it was and how it reflected the David Chang swagger of the other earlier Momofuku restaurants. That vibe is nowhere to be found in the new location. It feels like an overpriced tourist trap geared toward people who have a lot of money to spend, want to dabble in some gateway Korean food (and/or perhaps are not comfortable with venturing to K-town), and want to see and be seen. It looks like it was designed for social media posts. That being said, the food was decent. Our group participated in the full Ssam tasting menu and liked all of the dishes. Nothing was exceptionally memorable for me other than the salad (randomly). All of the dishes were very ""safe"" and not terribly exciting, but they were well executed. The service was good until the end, when we were asked to leave because they had to ""free up the table,"" even though all of the large tables around us were unoccupied. One other observation that I found to be somewhat interesting (as an Asian) was that I didn't see any Asians among the many staff members who were working there the night we went. I find that unusual for Â an Asian restaurant, but perhaps this just happened to be case the night we went. Ultimately, I doubt I will return to Ssam because it just feels like a ""new Coke"" version of the old location, but I do think the overall experience would be enjoyable for most people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/momofuku-ssam-bar-new-york-6?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Painful and bizarre experience this evening in the Seaport. Arrived early to our dinner reservation at the bar. Waited a while for someone to offer us a drink but eventually bartender did so, and we ordered, happy and excited to eat at a restaurant we've missed in the pandemic, and had never eaten at since its move from the EV. Had the wine list and menus in front of us as we began to cheers our first cocktail and look at the menus. A person--server, manager?--came around to our bar seats in a nearly empty restaurant (there was only one other person there), reached over me and plucked away the wine list. I said in a friendly way: ""I was planning on looking at the wine list for dinner."" The person looked at me with deadlights, coldly saying: ""Should I bring it back or were you planning on holding it for the duration?"" with an edge. I looked around in confusion. ""Do you need it right now?"" Again, deadlights. As if I were holding open the train doors during rush hour preventing the world from moving. She said fine, keep it and brusquely left. Her attitude was the opposite of hospitable. It was provocative, and scornful and ad hominem. It's hard to convey the strangeness and the low grade contempt/rage of the person talking to us in this review. Who cares about the wine list? Not me! Certainly was happy to relinquish it if someone else needed it! But there was no one there in the restaurant besides us and this person's attitude was nothing but disagreeable bordering on hateful. My partner and I looked at each other in bewilderment. We debated what to do and agreed we had no desire to stay for a meal after such a strange and odious interaction. I paid the check for two cocktails and we left, abandoning a dinner we had been looking forward to for a week. I explained to the hostess the reason we were leaving on the way out. She seemed to intuit why we were leaving but didn't apologize, only said she hoped we found a place to eat that we liked, as if we were hard to please, entitled guests.

Eternanda F.,/user_details?userid=q-ffzPVwTw6JQtRpsw6yoQ,"Alexandria, VA",5/27/2014,1.0,"Took my mom to ny for a late Mother's day gift. Once she got up the courage to walk across the mini bridge to the restaurant we were greeted by a very sweet lady named Tara. It was our first time so we ot a bit mixed up and went straight to the bar. As we passed another sweet lady, Stacey greeted us with a great smile and comforted my mother in being on the pier, since it was hard enough to get her there! All was well until we approached the bar. The day was so lovely so I couldn't understand what the ""sour lemon"" face she was making. I asked her for a menu and she points upward and keeps doing what she was doing. No ""hello how are you what can I get you"". Then I ask if I can take it dpwn because I couldn't see it. She spat out something about company policy and kept standing there like we would get the menu thru osmosis and hurry up and order and quit wasting her precious time. Then she unravels a ball of paper and hands it to us. Suprise, a menu. We thanked her kindly and her response to our thank you was silence. I said thank you again...silence again. Then she stood there waiting once more. As my mom begin to order and ask questions she rolled her eyes and looked down for the rest of the order...pursing her lips as though taking our order was the equivalent of being forced to clean a restroom. Beautiful restaurant. We were hot, starving, tired and just trying to enjoy the breeze; however an attitude plastered on the face of some bar chic quickly soured the mood and though we cpuld have stayed, there is PLENTY more food in new york city. Pier 66 Maritime ought to have a few more staceys and taras cause im not sure where that young lady came from. Still starving..but folks should know none pf us are obligated to it with your restaurant. ...fix your face and serve if thats what you signed up for....and I promise, we tip pretty damn well ;-)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pier-66-maritime-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Tak C.,/user_details?userid=UP_PwT6gADhO6yrmqchWUw,"Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, NY",9/3/2013,4.0,We finished biking along the Hudson River Greenway bike path today and wanted to get something to eat. My daughter wanted a place by the water so we came across Pier 66 Maritime on Yelp. What a great discover for us it was! Casual atmosphere with a beautiful view of the Hudson River and the NJ skyline. you can catch a great view of the sunset here. Very romantic. However Please note this is a place where you order and pickup your food at the counter and find you own table type of restaurant. No waiter services. Also food is served on plastic plate and utensils(I would have give it a five stÃ r if they provide real plates and utensils).

The main bar is reasonable, but the mixed drink/frozen drink bar has some of the worst bartenders in the city, and I think I waited around 40 minutes or more for some overpriced daquiris. Also, when we asked a waitress if she could ask some people to stop smoking, she gave us an attitude about it (even though it's illegal). The best thing about this place?

Karina L.,/user_details?userid=BeweIvm0NyHQ5k9HhWNyDw,"New York, NY",2/21/2023,2.0,"As cute and aesthetically pleasing Maman was, my experience here was not the greatest. Coming on a weekend was a huge mistake because it was so packed. The storefront is where you would order and pick up your food and drinks and the space was small that everyone was just crowding around; it felt very hectic. There were a lot of tables in the back though, but it is a self service space. My friends and I did have to line up for a while to order, but it did not take too long for our drinks to come out. We got the iced honey lavender latte and it was just ok. It didn't have very strong honey, lavender, or espresso taste. None of the pastries we got were heated up. To be honest, not sure if they would've been willing to do that anyways. The banana bread was dense. The famous cookie was alright, but a little too crispy for my liking. The almond chocolate croissant was perfectly sweet, but it wasn't a light and fluffy croissant..it looked like it was squished and dense. I had really high expectations for this spot as there are so many good reviews, but honestly, it's overrated.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/maman-new-york-22?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I went to the Spring Street Â location because duh it's the original. For $4.60 the nutty chocolate chip cookie was divine. The best chocolate chip cookie in NYC. IMO better than Levain. The texture of the crispy outside and the soft inside made it a great combination. You can taste the chocolate chips and the nuts without it being too nutty. It's heaven in your mouth. I ordered 3 just cuz.

He was not happy to exchange my order he said no one was complaining before and I explained that I don't really like it. The manager was not professional to handle this situation and said in-front of me to waitress that give her to change but it will be last time second he can't do it ( I understand but I am sorry I didn't like it but don't need to be so rude).

Once I picked up the food, I decided to eat outside. They have a cute little outdoor dining area. The sandwich and salad were fantastic! Authentic French food, with high quality ingredients.

I'd come years ago when maman had only this location, and it was nice experience then, but the restaurant is seriously understaffed at the moment. Â The server, albeit nice, never came to our table without being flagged down or chased after. We had to ask for water twice, as twenty minutes after being seated we didn't even get tap water, just empty glasses. Â We weren't the only ones waiting for service either. Other customers at different tables kept standing and looking around, waiting to tell someone that they wanted to order, or to pay, or to make corrections to their meals. The eggs ratatouille was good and the decor is pretty. The pistachio chocolate croissant was a bit too sweet and soft, the cortado too bitter. Overall I would not recommend sitting down for a meal.

It's a good thing they split it as it took a while for our food. And then three of us were served and it was at least ten minutes longer before my other nieces chicken sandwich arrived--that shouldn't happen--food should all come out at the same time. And my other nieces food wasn't the way she'd ordered--a croissant sandwich with a well cooked egg and no mustard sauce. Hers arrived smothered in mustard sauce with a runny egg. They took it back and then a few minutes later brought a new one with an apology--but this time it was missing the cheese and the egg was even runnier! She didn't send it back again, just ate what she could. My salad with kale and rosemary grilled chicken was delicious and my sister's egg hash and potato was also very good. So it was mixed for us.

Danielle H.,/user_details?userid=yf19ZDaWWs-_iSYB-QFQ1g,"Manhattan, NY",9/26/2021,5.0,"My friend and I came here for the first time with her 1 year old dog. We called ahead and they were extremely accommodating and pet friendly. While they don't take reservations, we were kindly greeted and helped by such a lovely woman named Annette or Anita- she was at the front, but I believe also a manager. She was personable, friendly, kind and helpful. We ended up sitting outside as the outdoor patio was being used for an event. I got the PLT sandwich, which is pastrami, machego (I subbed for feta), tomatoes, pickled onions, mixed greens and a wasabi Russian dressing on ciabatta. It was delicious. Flavorful is an understatement. It is quite large, so you can definitely share for lunch, but my friend ended up getting the mamans breakfast sandwich which was good, but I liked mine better. Hers had homemade bacon jam, fresh avocado, roasted tomatoes and a fried egg on a focaccia bun. We both had bellinis which in my own opinion is hard to screw up. For dessert we ordered the Nutella brownie, which was just ok- wouldn't get again, and the nutty chocolate chip cookie which was good along with the s'mores cookie which was also very good. Their kitchen closes at 4pm, but we really didn't feel rushed at all, in fact, our server told us after paying that we could sit until closing time (6pm- in which we didn't, but it was a nice gesture).

You rarely get ""lavender"" and herbs in waffles and this place offers that.

Colleen C.,/user_details?userid=0ilkU8rSejzXRQLjoshMTQ,"Hercules, CA",10/23/2019,5.0,You can tell a lot of locals frequent this place just by seeing how the staff interacts with them. They say hello/wave like they've been coming here for years. Place is small and quaint. Has a cute barn door to go next door for more seating. Ordered the Mediterranean breakfast plate. The toast was so delicious. I can tell they make good bread here. Wasn't very busy at 8am but picked up quickly afterwards. Also got their s'mores cookie for fun. It's super chewy and chunky. Can't wait to try other pastries in the future.

If you want a cookie - Maman is the place. When we walked in they had just been cleared out so we waited for the batch in the oven to finish baking. It was worth it. The whole bakery filled with a delicious sweet aroma as we waited and we were able to get two different cookies as fresh as can be. While I was told the nutty chocolate chip was the best - I actually preferred the white chocolate pretzel.

Elinor G.,/user_details?userid=SyR0DNf25xBL0V56TIsHTg,"Sedro-Woolley, WA",10/4/2021,1.0,"One of the worst breakfast experiences of my life. Â I am an easy to please person in general, but this place ruined my day. Â I tried to treat myself to a nice meal, ordered the rabbit hole. Â The dish makes no sense how it is served it is super difficult to eat, a crusty tough bread bowl essentially which is not at all what I expected from the menu description. Â I struggled with a butter knife to even break it into manageable edible bites while I waited for anyone to check on me and how my meal was going. Â I needed water, a steak knife, and a different salad dressing in order to eat my meal. Â The salad was drenched in a sickeningly sweet dressing. Â I can't have that much sugar for health reasons so I asked for a different salad. Â They brought me another dressing, also super sweet. Â No salad. Had to walk to the counter to ask for new salad. Â Then realized the dressing was also full of sugar. Â This whole process took way too long until the bread bowl thing was cold and hard. Â I was just over it and knew I still have to go buy breakfast somewhere else. Â I asked for a refund on my food because I couldn't eat it. Â The manager argued with me and told me they had offered me different dressings so they can't give me a refund. Â Ok? Â I have worked in many restaurants and I am polite, but in this case I was justified in requesting my money back. Â The food was cold and I had terrible service. Â And it simply didn't taste good. Â That is enough to give any one in customer service the indicator that you need to make it right with the customer. I tried discussing this with the manager and he simply argued with me on every point and refused a refund which is what has forced me to leave this honest review. I don't like resorting to damaging a business reputation and writing reviews is an absolute last resort. Â I always try to resolve it first in a calm and reasonable manner if something is actually wrong. Â Every other restaurant I have worked in or been to is quick to respond to customer complaints and make it right as that is the best way to run a business and earn respect and even earn back a customer you would have lost. Â Very disappointed and terrible way to start my day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/maman-new-york-22?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Carl C.,/user_details?userid=M6uAthcx7eHFYrQ8Bx8Edg,"Durham, NC",1/24/2020,5.0,"Toyotomi Shibayoshi heard of a cookie that was Oprah's favorite in 2017. Â A Shogun must sample this cookie to Â see if it's great. Toyotomi Shibayoshi will judge since it is he and the Shogunate who decides if things are worthy of greatness. Upon entering the establishment Toyotomi was indeed pleased with smell of baked goods, the Â sights do justice as well to blend the experience to your senses. Many options were in sight for the Shogun to Â choose from, almond croissants , homemade Oreo, a white chocolate blueberry lavender loaf, a chai spice beignet, all looked tasty and worthy of a battle on the plains of snacking. But ultimately Toyotomi was here for the Nutty Chocolate Chip Cookie . The stage was set for a full on flavor battle here in SoHo. The Shogun went to the counter and ordered the cookie... The lady shopkeeper asked only One......, Toyotomi Shibayoshi likes this reply, make that Two kind miss. Cookies were gathered and put in a small bag and placed for the Shogun on the counter. Toyotomi Shibayoshi handed the lady a card which has many monies on it to pay for the services.. Toyotomi Shibayoshi leaves the 20% tip, for her quick hands on cookie approach. With bag in hand of one his trusted vassals the Shogun stops for a quick pic inside. More pictures would have been taken but the excitement had the Shogun ready for battle. Outside the Shogun takes his first bite...... after smelling the appealing scent of the cookie. Â The moment of truth................... Â It is as if for a moment you have transcended time and flavor, then your taste buds snap you back to reality for the indulgence of the Ambrosia you have just put in your mouth. The Shogun slowly eats his prize, this is a battle of taste that must last as long as it can. Heavenly deliciousness given from the Gods of Snacking have bestowed upon a mortal for a moment whaat it would be like to fly among the heavens. Yus you mere mortals, IT IS THAT GOOD. The Shogun of Snaxx, Toyotomi Shibayoshi declares here and now that this is the finest cookie in the land that he has tasted. Â The Shogunate awards Maman of SoHo New York City the only 6 Katanas out of 5 on the Imperial Shogun Scale. Yus a 6 Katanas score... unbelievable flavor has risen up to push the scale overboard.

When I came today, the man at the cashier was extremely rude and laughing. He not only didn't help me with my order, but also he made fun of me, especially with other customers behind me. In addition, my drink tasted especially thick - I think he used almond milk or soy milk in place of regular milk even though I didn't ask for it. Lastly, the back room (where customers can go to sit and enjoy themselves) was completely messy, with other customer's old and half eaten things on the table. Thus, my sister and I had no where to sit.

Cynthia Y.,/user_details?userid=9JPXARHh9_HlNKVKX_UvFg,"Franklin Square, NY",3/3/2019,3.0,"This location needs to work on the execution of their ordering process. When you walk in, you see the counter, menu and some baked breads, pastries, and such. The cashier is to the side, where the narrow hallway is. My friend and I walk in, and wait by the cashier bc we were only getting drinks. The cashier (Indian female) took a customer who just walked in the door after us, first, and then told me to move (so rude). A tall gentleman working in the back saw her rudeness and asked if he can help us. (He gets 5 stars for service). We order 2 lavender hot chocolates with coconut milk. While waiting to pay, the same female cashier told me to move again, like where do you want me to stand? I'm not SpiderMan, I can't jump on the wall and hang out there. The place was very packed and there were no empty tables in the back either so we took it to go. The hot chocolate is very rich and good, the lavender aspect is basically some dried edible lavender buds, which is fragrant at first, but after a while becomes too overwhelming. I would skip the lavender next time, as I ended up having to spit out (ladylike I know) all the lavender buds into a napkin because I couldn't stand it any longer. The cups are cutely designed and aesthetically pleasing. They should move the cash register to the front, and have people wait on the side for their order. The system they have now definitely is confusing and everyone is cramped in a tiny little space (fire hazard).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/maman-new-york-22?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Maya E.,/user_details?userid=BtrUXJ2MmLtG_2-KMoJwZQ,"Manhattan, NY",12/15/2018,3.0,"Came here with a friend on a Friday afternoon to grab a quick bite to eat. We ordered the quiche christel ($6.5), the Claudia sandwich ($8), and orange juice & coffee. After ordering, we were confused about the system of the restaurant - we decided to go ahead and seat ourselves. However, when we went to sit down, we were told that part of the restaurant was for dine-in guests only. This was a bit frustrating, as we did not know that this was a possibility when we were ordering at the cafe. Had we known this was an option, we would have opted to ""dine-in"" and order off the menu and have our meal with service included. Luckily, they had other seating available. The ambiance of the restaurant is very cute and quaint, especially the ""dine-in"" area which is very unique. It is basically an antique store at the front and a tiny restaurant in the back. Food was pretty decent and its a good spot to sit and chat or to get some work done. Service could be more polite and they should probably tell their guests the difference between the cafe and the restaurant itself to avoid confusion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/maman-new-york-22?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I love the back room with the rustic wooden tables, potted plants, and small patio. For a place with such a cute ambiance, the food was very good, too. We got the zucchini noodles, matcha waffles (previously on the menu, they were pancakes), and ""rabbit hole"" sandwich. The zucchini noodles were refreshing, and I appreciated that they had a creative healthier item on the brunch menu. It actually has grapes and basil leaves, which both meshed really well with the rest of the salad. The matcha waffles were tasty, though they reminded me more of Eggo waffles as the matcha flavor was very subtle. Portions were just right - not small, but not enormous.

Lavender hot chocolate with almond milk is really solid. Lavender flavor is subtle but really comes through without tasting soapy. Nutty chocolate chip cookie ($3.75) with nutella is not good--do not fall for this as they try to upsell you on the cookies. A bit burnt tasting with more-than-crisp outside. and macadamia nuts taste kind of old. Olive oil loaf cake with grapefruit glaze ($3.50) and white chocolate blueberry lavender cake ($3.50) aimed high and fell flat. Flavors did not come through. CrÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e croissant ($3.75) is ultra soft. A little difficult to eat because of how soft it is and how generously they packed in the cream, which is done so by slicing in half and simply piling it up before reassmbling.

Maman's cookies taste better cold. It was still good, though surprisingly, their white choc chip cookie with a pretzel on top, tastes even better than their traditional chocolate chip cookie!

The flour and chocolate itself was average, and it is the salted macadamia nuts IN the cookie that sets it worlds apart tbh. Without it, the cookie itself would taste plain and generic. Its the natural fat in the macadamia nuts that gives the cookie all the flavor. I like super dark chocolate chunks, so maybe a more bitter cookie for me. But its hood, a nice mild, sweet and savory cookie with surprisingly generous amounts of macadamia nuts. The nuts don't taste stale, like a lot of store bought macadamia nuts do. $3.75 + tax = $4.08 for a quite big palm sized cookie is worth the calorie and wallet splurge every once in a while.

Huge piece which I couldn't finish. Love the to-go coffee cups with their blue and white toile look. They didn't have a lot of pastry choices when we were there (Sunday at 9:00 a.m.). I ordered the chocolate almond croissant, but it wasn't really a croissant. The consistency was more shortbread like. Â Delicious, but not a croissant. It didn't look like the chocolate and plain croissants that were still in the case as we left. Somewhere else on Yelp, you can see a picture of it. My husband wished the quiche was hotter, but the slightly more than room temperature was fine for mine.

We wanted to order a bottle of wine and asked for recommendations for a not dry, closer to sweet red wine. The waiter said he couldn't think of anything that fit that and brought some of their house sangria to try. It was obviously too sweet so we picked a bottle on our own and they allowed us to try it and it was good. I hit the mushroom ravioli appetizer and my date got the West Indian spiced bbq shrimp. The ravioli was a little salty but it kinda worked. The shrimp was good but I wouldn't call it West Indian spiced. For main dish I got the NY strip with sun dried tomatoes topping. It was SMOTHERED and I was not expecting that for what should be a good cut of meat. It was good but lacked what you expect from a New York strip.

It's a fairly nice evening so we decide to sit outside. My friend's been under the weather but agrees that we should order a nice bottle of red wine. Matthew our waiter suggests a montepulciano and it's superb. We share a walnut vinaigrette salad with mushrooms. It's a perfect starter. The menu has two duck entries, we each order a different one.

We did make a 6pm reservation, thankfully we did because we would have been waiting for a bit. We were greeted by the owner, who sat us on the patio! We were out celebrating our anniversary and they delivered on every aspect of the meal. Nice ""Crisp"" brew to start off the meal. Crab cakes, Shrimp app with some delicious combo of flavors. But wait there's more...Chicken, spinach, goat cheese , fig jelly...mic drop, pick it up; Steak Diane that you could have drank the sweet flavor that blanketed the fine cut of meat. Side of asparagus and real buttery mashed...there is no way we can do dessert, but we do coffee. The special anniversary dessert was delivered which was a nice touch, much appreciated! Price point was in line with the food quality, service and experience. We are from out of towners but felt the urge to write this review because more people need to experience this little gem that has been doing it well for a long while.

Â I had an almond-crusted chicken and my girlfriend had the spinach and goat cheese-stuffed chicken breast. Â Both were a unique take on your typical chicken dinner and excellent. Â I live in the neighborhood because I feel like its more of a community than other parts of Manhattan I've lived in and Henry's End Â has a warm presence that feels like part of a community too.

Kate S.,/user_details?userid=j0lLyzRb3NYarlnZRGa-7w,"Brooklyn, NY",12/7/2016,3.0,Came years ago and loved it but didn't have the same experience. I will try again because I love the vibe and coziness. Had a steak and it was cooked fine but sauce was bland. My friend ordered the sole thinking it would be baked or sautÃ©ed but it came out with three huge pieces of fried fish. Waiter was consumed with the couple to the left and our bottle of wine should have been decanted 4 hours to make it drinkable and it wasn't inexpensive. Shouldn't have even been on the menu. Know this is a standby and probably is more consistent when you go more often.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-end-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Martin R.,/user_details?userid=fWXEcV-TiMq3CK_dLZWI3w,"Annapolis, MD",7/25/2017,4.0,"We frequently eat in Brooklyn because both our children and their families live in Clinton Hills. Because we were staying at the new 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge as part of an Anniversary celebration we looked for a quiet venue within walking distance. We rarely get to Brooklyn Heights but noticed the block of restaurants on Henry Avenue and selected Henry's End. We loved the ambience as soon as we entered. We had not made a reservation however they made a place for us in a secluded corner. The service was relaxed and efficient. Because of the menu's stress on game we shared the terrine, a salad and the duck. Everything was delicious and we paired the food with a quaffable wine suggested by the server. We finished with the Dark and White Chocolate Mousse. It was a totally wonderful experience and the walk back with the view looking over toward lower Manhattan completed the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-end-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sara-Lee R.,/user_details?userid=SRz2TNkOZ1qVuu2LEdih5Q,"West Hempstead, NY",5/30/2019,3.0,"2 of us went to Henry's end on a random Wednesday and it wasn't too packed. A little chilly outside (rain was coming soon) but we decided to sit outside anyways. Table was a little rocky because we were on a slant but manager fixed it right away. Service was impeccable - manager and all servers were quick and friendly and knowledgeable. I did the 3 course pre-fixe for $42 and got the soft shell crab, sole citron, and the apple cobbler. He got the ribs app and the 15 spice steak medium. I liked the soft shell crab but he didn't love it. Ribs were supposed to be sweet and spicy but they weren't spicy at all. Before I decided on the sole, I asked many questions about breaded dishes and didn't want any of them. But when I got the sole, it was entirely breaded. You would think that if I went against all the breaded things, I wouldn't want that. The steak was okay but really chewy and the spices were a lot. I loved the apple cobbler - he doesn't like sweets. I got sparkling - can't go wrong there. He got cocktails - didn't complain. Overall - a bit overpriced and not the best for the money.

Had my dish been cooked to order, I would have given it three stars. But who wants well done meh salmon? (I thought not.) My dining companions had meat, and both enjoyed their dishes. (I sucked it up - the experience, not the food - of course, but seriously.) So, if you like pork or beef I would say try this place. Just don't, whatever you do, order expensive medium rare salmon.

Will R.,/user_details?userid=zTHK_nlgh8Bz_AXPksPKng,"Minneapolis, MN",10/19/2015,5.0,"I have to dole out a 5 star for this amazing place. Not only is the food excellent the waitstaff are extremely courteous and sensitive to every diner here. This place functioned like a well oiled machine, our courses came out with such perfect timing. We started with some Crab cakes, whoa, utterly amazing. I could have just ordered these....... just kidding, because for my entree I had an amazing mixed gamer grill, which included quail, elk chops, and elk sausages. This was superb, but the standout were the perfectly cooked elk chops. This is perfect meat, better than any beef I've ever had. It was superlative food. My family ordered from their regular menu, tortilla flour crusted shrimp (amazing) and stuffed chicken (also amazing). Another very special aspect of the restaurant is the beer list- it's thoughtfully curated with many nods to local breweries, but with some great beers from all over the country. You can see that whoever put this together really believes that beer deserves the same emphasis as wine at fine dining establishments. Henry's end is a special place. It's unpretentious, yet in my opinion it can stand up to any NYC michelin starred restaurant. It's a place with great food, great service, and simply put authentic charm. If you're going out for a splurge or special occasion, it's my advice to consider this place. I can't wait to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-end-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The Jedi Foodi E.,/user_details?userid=_XxNSjq1W1AuLuQa73jchQ,"New York, NY",5/8/2010,4.0,"In spring of 2005 I was dating a girl from Brooklyn Heights. The romance did not work out but one night we dined at Henry's End and I can say that this restaurant is the best thing that came out of that relationship. I put my name on their mailing list and every year around my birthday I get a voucher in the mail for a free entree. For the past six years I have dined at Henry's End on my birthday weekend and it has been an affair to remember. Chef/Owner Mark Lahm began his career at Henry's End in 1981 as a dishwasher and busboy. He eventually became a waiter, then manager, then chef. In 1986, he graduated from the Culinary Institute of America and took over the restaurant and Henry's End has become one of the best kept secret foodie destinations in Brooklyn to this day. The 2006 Zagat awarded the restaurant a score of 26 for food and an earlier edition stated ""this is why they built the Brooklyn Bridge"". In 2002, Mark and his staff hosted an event at the prestigious James Beard House. The restaurant has a cozy cabin-like feel but with taller ceilings adorned with fans and neon lights. The spacious open kitchen allows for diners to watch their meals come to creation methodically. Tables are a little tight together but in this environment it adds to the dining experience rather than detracting. The staff is very friendly and treats you like family even if it's your first time at Henry's End. Chef Lahm crafts entrees like chicken with pears, walnuts, and blue cheese, and blackened lamb sirloin over garlic mashed potatoes. Warm up with his New Orleans turtle soup and sherry. Make sure to visit Henry's End in the fall and winter (October-March) for their famous Wild Game Festival, where exotic game dishes like the herb-crusted elk and pepper-crusted venison and roasted wild boar are legendary. As an appetizer, the restaurant does offer an Assorted Wild Game Charcuterie of which, on this visit, included buffalo sausage, partridge sausage and Muscovy Duck pÃ¢te. Antelope, bear, kangaroo and python salad are also among the ferocious fare available at this white-tablecloth Brooklyn Heights standby. The restaurant is also known for its great duck dishes. The ducklings are braised in their own natural juices until they are flavorful and fork tender. Then they are boned and the fat rendered until the skin is delightfully crisp. The accompanying sauces include raspberry, or honey and ginger with soy and scallions, or a wild mushroom lingonberry sauce with shallots, thyme and brandy. To entice recession affected diners, Henry's End has been offering a $25 three course prix fixe on Mondays thru Thursdays with wine pairings for an additional $14. The restaurant also features an award winning American wine list. Chef Lahm carefully selects an eclectic wine menu for his offerings. On this night a 2007 Amador Rose was paired with scrumptious al dente crab and lobster ravioli. Diver scallops faired well with the grape tomatoes and a 2006 Dr. Frank Rkatsiteli varietal. Moroccan Grilled Salmon topped with a compound butter made from cumin, cayenne, mint and scallions and served over garlic mashed potatoes was a wonderful healthy option. ""Drop-your-fork"" delicious spinach sautÃ©ed in garlic went great with cauliflower, capers and cranberries. With the main courses, we indulged in hearty sides of arugula and roasted beets paired with a 2007 Van Ruiten Chardonnay. My Duck with Wild Morel & Portobello Mushrooms & Lingonberries Sauce, shallots, thyme and brandy melted in my mouth as I swirled my aromatic glass of 2005 David Bruce Petite Sirah. The meal crescendo included a Valrhona black and white chocolate mousse and an apple golden raisin cobbler covered in a light and flaky almond streusel crust. Our diligent server Nate paired our desserts with a satisfying glass of Fonseca Bin 27 Port. Dinner for two with birthday discount, tax and tip was $120.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-end-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Scott B.,/user_details?userid=rc4USKiO676ehEqj2vESBA,"Riverdale, Bronx, NY",7/15/2011,2.0,"Service = okay. Atmosphere = quaint & romantic. Price = Overly expensive. Food = minimal & typical. Boy, was I disappointed with this place. My major complaint was with quantity of food served. I ordered their short ribs, which was certainly a mistake-- the entrÃ©e consisted of 3 small, half-dollar sized pieces of beef served over a half cup of mashed potatoes and 3 pieces of broccoli. Did they think they were serving food to a toddler? For $22.95, I expected ALOT more. As for the meat itself, it was tender, but the gravy tasted like packaged instant gravy. The mashed potatoes were typical but served mixed with wasabi or horseradish, which really added nothing special to the mix (in other words, they were bland)... plus, they weren't even creamy. We did order the crab cakes appetizer with our meal, and it was flavorful, but, again, they were quite small. Note that if you order them, they are deep fried and not pan fried or baked, so they aren't really flaky like you find in most restaurants. Nonetheless, they tasted fine. Vinny ordered a strip steak smothered in a mustard sauce. The portion size for this was a little better than the other items we ordered, and he said the steak tasted fine. Â All in all, our experience was mixed, with Vinny liking the restaurant more than me. But, oh how I wanted to fall in love with this place b/c it's close to our house... but I was mostly disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-end-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

In addition, the bread sticks in the complimentary bread basket were a bit soggy, obviously stale from having sat out. On second thought, maybe this is more of a 2.5 star kind of place?

Justin C.,/user_details?userid=ziheST-Dc3HcyCevMqC7Hw,"Boston, MA",9/13/2007,5.0,"Absolutely one of my favorite carnivorous haunts in the city. Henry's End is a cozy, intimate, typical Brooklyn Heights neighborhood place; it almost feels like a hunting lodge with its wooden interior. They make fresh stocks daily, and you will taste that in their very rich sauces that they serve over their meat dishes - the last time I was there, I had a hangar steak au poivre dressed with a mustard cream sauce. Another recent highlight was a bourbon glazed rib eye topped with a corn salsa. These subtle riffs on classic main meat dishes are what really sets this place apart. You may also find wilder meats on their menu, like elk chops and venison, but that varies seasonally. They tend to have many seasonal specials on their menu, and those can change week to week too, but they are all good! They also have excellent pasta dishes - everything is rich and hearty and great here. The service has all the charm a Brooklyn neighborhood spot should and then some - they have a loyal clinetele from all over the city that visits them regularly, and you will see the patrons hugging and kissing the waitstaff on entry. This and Noodle Pudding and Brooklyn Heights' contribution to the best kept dining secrets in NYC. If you are into good meat dishes, you will be thrilled you came. Not to mention they have Sam Smith's beer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-end-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Christina S.,/user_details?userid=T14t8EBVu2pm-nNAYnAnKA,"West Palm Beach, FL",2/13/2010,5.0,"My husband and I came here last night for my birthday and the food was absolutely delish! The first time we ate here, I wasn't too crazy about the dish I had ordered. I believe I had gotten some kind of duck but it was very fatty and gamey. My husband had gotten the 3 mustard salmon and he said it was amazing. Last night we came back so that we could try out their wild game festival. My husband ordered the Elk, I ordered one of their specials, Canadian Salmon with lobster risotto with a champagne vanilla sauce. Both dishes were outstanding! His elk was soo good. Not gamey, not an ounce of fat on it and cooked to perfection. The sauce which was made with wine and the natural drippings from the elk itself, was so delish. My husband soaked it up Â with his bread once he was done with his chops. My salmon was perfectly cooked and the skin was so crunchy. The lobster risotto was also cooked perfectly with big chunks of lobster in it. The champagne vanilla sauce, although a little on the salty side which made me drink about 3-4 glasses of water, was outstanding. When I eat out, I hardly ever finish my meal. Last night, my plate was empty. The only downside was they didn't bring us any sides but truthfully with the amount of food that was on my plate and the size of his elk chops, we didn't really care. We are definitely going back in October once their game festival starts up again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-end-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

S. W.,/user_details?userid=H6mrI62filljv2uIKe8ARw,"Alpharetta, GA",4/30/2014,3.0,"Made my first visit to Henry's End a couple of weeks ago. Perhaps, after hearing so many raves about it, I had unrealistic expectations, or perhaps I just hit it on a bad night. The cozy, rustic, atmosphere is wonderful, and the bartender can mix a mean cocktail, so compliments are due, I found the menu exciting (albeit a bit pricey for a neighborhood haunt) and was torn between a couple of different dishes...always a good sign. I started with the wild mushroom salad, which was really excellent. As a main course, I opted for the sole with the lobster and tomato cream, as another member of our party ordered it before and raved about it. When the fish arrived at the table it was clear the it was not fresh fish, as there was a slight tinge of odor to it...not awful, but still noticeable. Also...I have my doubts about it being sole; if it was sole it was the thickest piece of sole I've ever had. Â At first bite, I was inclined to believe the fish was also frozen, and not fresh catch. Trust me, I know my fresh fish...I grew up by the sea. I ate as much of it as i could, but just couldn't get through the mushy, grainy texture of the fish to finish the meal....disappointing at best. I then ordered a banana pudding that arrived in a martini glass. Without exaggeration, there was two inches of pudding topped with five inches of whipped cream....nice presentation, but it took three tries to reach the pudding through the mountain of topping. With that said, I will give it another try; every restaurant has a bad night. Thumbs up for atmosphere, and service. Â Here's hoping the next visit is a better one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-end-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Zando E.,/user_details?userid=VE_U0vI-jfcRHSdNkCTilQ,"New York, NY",6/30/2010,2.0,"I've been eating at Henry's end for a little over 10 years, and the quality has steadily gone down over that time. Their winter game festival is still kind of OK, but overall, the level of cooking is now mediocre at best. For some reason they've taken to grossly over saucing everything - perhaps to mask the declining quality of the raw ingredients. A recent filet mignon had quite a bit of sinew in it, and rare tuna was slightly funky - not outright spoiled, but not that fresh. You might be tempted by their Prix Fixe menu - don't be. In a display of complete lack of graciousness, they remove the vegetables from their prix fixe offerings, then offer to return them for an exorbitant price. Aside from the stinginess (potatoes cost pennies!), it makes for a very poor plating, and casts an unpleasant pall over the meal. Really guys, if you can't afford to throw a vegetable on the plate, don;t offer the menu! Their desserts are huge, but at the level of a decent diner. This used to be a place to go for a treat, but it is sadly no longer worth the price, even if someone else is paying.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/henrys-end-brooklyn-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This place is pretty close to my apartment and I've been meaning to try it for a while. Being a weekday, it wasn't super crowded. I sat at one of the high top tables. The waiter was really patient as I decided what I wanted. I ordered a flat white with soy milk and the banana bread. The flat white was absolutely amazing (not to mention pretty lol). They were really quick to bring out my food as well. The banana bread was so delicious! It's plated very nicely and has a great taste. It comes on top of Greek yogurt (which was perfectly sweet and not at all bitter which was my feat when I ordered it), red grapes (I wish it had more), a sprinkles of granola (also wish it had more, it was barely any) and a drizzle of caramel (added an amazing flavor). Although it was super tasty, you don't get a lot for what you pay for honestly. My total bill was $15 without tip and I left a little hungry still.

Food is also on the fresh and healthy side with generally generous portions. Only docked a star because the day we came was the heat wave and the AC was either not working or not sufficient. When they brought water for the table they also brought a pitcher room temp. I'm not one to complain but gimme some ice in your sauna of a restaurant PLEASE.

I came here on a week day for brunch with my mom. The space is small but cozy. The staff are all very nice, when you walk in they greet you almost immediately. We started off with a large coffee which was served in a little pot and enough for 2 people to share. We shared a waffle, the waffle was a bit dense and hard in my opinion, I wish it was more fluffy and soft. My advice to the restaurant would be to not sprinkle it with the powdered sugar because I personally like my waffles plain. Other then that it was good. My mom got the avocado toast, she did not want the feta or cheese, Since the smashed avocado already has the onions mixed in they offered to slice fresh avocado on top which worked out really well.

But on a saturday morning with plenty of free tables - the waiter rudely tells me ""we don't allowed tablets on week-ends"" - thus implying I'm about to stay an hour, just because I've pulled that object out (but phones are ok - no one can dwell on them forever in their minds, it seems).

While the wait was a bit long, all the food was fresh and well worth it. The restaurant has a unique ordering system where you can mark off your food choices on a menu at the table and then give it to your waiter or waitress. The prices were a little more expensive than other dim sum places I've been to, but not too bad for the quality of food. The atmosphere of the restaurant is good, and the service is friendly. All in all, I would recommend Dim Sum Palace for fresh, high-quality dim sum, but be prepared for a wait during peak hours.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-9?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Anyways, immediately we are greeted with the man who wears a UCLA uncle hat. He knew Filipino dishes so the first thing he offered my entire family was lugaw Â (congee). The family couldn't say no - so they got some and they liked it. For our meal, we ordered the chicken juicy dumpling, pork dumpling, shrimp shumai, chicken feet, Peking duck, pineapple fried rice, and this beef noodle dish that I didn't catch the name of. Everyone enjoyed the meal taste-wise! I had ordered the pineapple fried rice, hoping it was going to come in a pineapple like the photo, but it didn't. That was the only upsetting part. Other than that, we're definitely coming back to visit! When I come by myself, I will definitely be ordering more than we did during our visit. I felt like I needed to experience more but we had all gotten full very fast! I didn't get many photos and took more videos... whoops!

I was excited to come here due to the rave reviews, but I found the dim sum dishes average. Ordering consists of checking off what you want on the menu. The chicken feet were cut into smaller pieces than other restaurants and seemed thinner. This dish comes with peanuts, so be aware if you are allergic. I thought the turnip cakes could have been seared more so that it has a crispier edge. There was too much oyster sauce on them.

There actually isn't much dim sum on their UberEats menu. The congee and e fu noodles were excellent and standardly portioned. The sichuan wontons were a bit disappointing - the filling was too firm and the sauce too cornstarchy and gelatinous.

It's not overpowering or heavy, unlike other dimsum places where it feels like you're eating buckets of salt/msg. I like that they make chicken shumai here, it's not a strong but comfortable and homey flavor. The congee has many big chunks of meat and pidan. The chashu bun is super fluffy, with yummy sweet meat filling. I would say that the soup dumplings have a thicker, chewier and less artfully folded skin than what you might get at a true soup dumpling restaurant, perhaps since this isn't a Shanghainese establishment but rather Canto. That said, the soup inside is savory and light, and you can tell the skin was housemade, it's still good. The auntie and waitstaff treated us well, and our food was brought out at a good pace.

Susanna M.,/user_details?userid=6bM_FqFaOzdwJQy8g_NuCA,"New York, NY",7/28/2021,5.0,"So, I'm finally reviewing Dim Sum Palace after going here since 2018. I grew up eating dim sum with my mom and going on trips home to Taiwan. This is my favorite location of the local chain and the best place you can go in the East Village for dim sum. Tim Ho Wan can not compare (like really, why would you go there if you can go HERE?). When I lived in the east village I would go here minimum twice a month for dim sum and now that I've moved out of the neighborhood I still go out of my way to go here once a month. I would recommend it to anyone. It's affordable and you can't go wrong with their dim sum dishes. I typically go with one other person and get their har gow, shu mai, spare ribs, xiao long bao (soup dumplings), and typically supplement with one to two other dishes. On the weekends they have rice rolls so I definitely recommend getting those if you have the chance. They currently have an indoor and outdoor area to eat. The service is great and the food is delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-9?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Pricing is pretty good. People working there are very pleasant. Szechuan Spicy Dumpling has a nice thin wrapper and is packed with a very tasty pork filling. The downside is the sauce, which is gloppy and a bit gelatinous. They would do better with a really good simple hot oil. The cold sesame noodles are very basic. The scallion pancake has a better than average taste and consistency. We did really enjoy the shrimp shumai; which had a very nice amount of shrimp.

The logo outside doesn't help too much, looks a bit basic and tacky but when you enter the restaurant it feel different. Nothing too luxurious or special but it's clean, interior design is nice and simple. A pretty comfortable environment. Not super big or small, just a good size and several tables and it's usually not packed at all. Speaks both mandarin and English. Good service..friendly staffs, attentive, doesn't rush you, doesn't assume you speak Chinese because you look like one, and honestly pretty great prices. Quite a few different options for dim sum but they do have other Chinese dishes from appetizers, meat/veggies, to noodles or rice. A couple desserts and beverages too. Tasty food and nice texture. The Braised Five Spice Duck looks simple but tastes really nice and it's not too dry either. My friend wasn't a big fan on the bamboo shoot dumplings but I find it okay, doesn't have the ""wow"" factor but it's simple and light so good for the stomach. The steamed spare ribs w/ olive sauce was one of my favourite. Shrimp dumpling is like most places so nothing too special but they tastes good. Chicken feet was nice too. Shu Mai (shrimp and pork) was definitely my friend's favourite,:$3 almost wanted a second one. Is portion is perfect for the both of us.

To be honest, the environment is clean and service is good, however this couldn't help to raise the overall rating because their dim sum is below average. We ordered a couple dumplings to start, and the skins are too think while the fillings are all flavorless. We then tried the radish cake, and there is way more corn stretch than radish, making it soggy and flavorless. We also ordered the rice roll and the beef tasted dry as if you just heat up some frozen meat. No flavor again aside from the soy sauce. Their congee is also too over cooked that you can't really taste the texture of the rice.

Samantha E.,/user_details?userid=EVChLoqN0MyNBtYjFMkO5g,"New York, NY",12/23/2018,3.0,"I've been anxiously anticipating the grand opening of this new Dim Sum Palace location since the sign for it went up this summer. Finally went today with a group of friends for Sunday dim sum. There was no wait - it doesn't seem to have been really discovered by the neighborhood yet. There is not much dim sum competition in the neighborhood - Tim Ho Won is nearby but very overpriced. I thought that this place was good, overall, but lacking diversity of the menu and with a bit of room to improve on the dim sum. There is a 20% discount for dim sum right now during the opening, and a free dim sum with yelp check in, so I advise you to go try it before these deals run out. We tried several dishes. garlic spareribs were a highlight - dried garlic and chili on top made them very tasty. Also tried pork and shrimp siao mai - both very meaty and tasty. The Ha gow was good as well. The tiny pork buns could be improved - they don't have very much meat inside, mostly vegetables. And the soup dumplings were a bit low on the soup - mostly just pork inside. The green sesame peanut dessert balls were very good but the sesame balls were a bit undercooked - the dough was very soft and not as chewy as usual. I would return to try more dishes , especially if they add some more unique dim sum items to the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dim-sum-palace-new-york-9?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered 4 dishes which included pork soup dumplings, pork steamed buns, shrimp and pork siu mai, and egg custard buns. The soup dumplings were pretty good but the wrapper was a bit too thick and the soup flavor was a bit lackluster. I would say these were not a meal highlight. The siu mai were delicious with nice thin wrappers filled with big plump pieces of shrimp. I was pleasantly surprised as usually siu mai are mainly filled with pork rather than shrimp. My favorite dish was definitely the egg custard buns. The buns themselves were fluffy and soft and filled with a gooey perfectly sweet egg custard. So good and definitely a must order. I might come back just to order these some time.

With friends visiting from overseas it seemed like a great place to go. Sadly, it was one of the worst meals I've had in NYC. I'd made a reservation well in advance, and upon arrival, they had to squeeze us in when they were ready, not for the time I'd made the reservation for. The cocktails we ordered took a lifetime to arrive, were small, and the beer was flat. The food was the jewel in the awful crown; the burger was a cheap processed burger, in an even cheaper bun, rendering it completely tasteless. Fries were awful.

Our waiter with the long hair and bangs made us laugh multiple times, had the best recommendations, and was really kind about me spilling my water on the way Â out. The blonde host was extremely kind and every other busser and server met us with a smile including the manager. The chocolate cake was unbelievable and the steak was perfectly cooked. Drinks were great and I had a great time. Wasn't much of a wait at dinner either. I'm glad it's now open down the block from me and I will definitely be going back.

All of the waitresses were SO fun and friendly and brought out water bowls to the patrons with dogs. Super aesthetic and great outdoor seating. Service was super fast. 10/10 lattes. My boyfriend and I got the grapefruit yogurt parfaits and the granola was super good, grapefruit was really fresh. It's a little pricey, but you're paying for the incredible service and quality food.

Its amazing how you can eat a certain dish and it's so spicy, the you try another dish and it's also spicy, but a different kind of spice, then another dish which hits even more differently than the others. It's an incredible scaffolded spice journey I've been lucky enough to experience a few times. The service is great and the vibe and fun and energizing. There is usually a line of folks waiting and every table is usually full for good reason. I would definitely recommend calling ahead and making a reservation.

The sirloin and triple salad was the spiciest dish we got but the fresh vegetables were great to tame the heat. The place is pretty small and the atmosphere is kind of loud and chaotic.

When I went they were missing a few dishes that I wanted to try but had to order something else cause it was out. 8/10 would come here for the flavor and the urge to try more things but for the wait and the price I might have to consider it.

Jamie C.,/user_details?userid=o8O2k1E6JM3mdb70ZjbobQ,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",11/21/2022,4.0,"I've been wanting to come here for the longest time, I've seen ugly baby thrown around quite a bit as one of the spiciest restaurants that is not for the faint of heart, but haven't had the chance to venture off to brooklyn. When I finally did I was lucky enough to snag a spot - the establishment is Â quite small and bustling with people, so Â we are thankful they made the effort to accommodate our party, esp on such late notice :) We had a view of the kitchen and it was fun watching them cook. The flavors and food is overall good, but honestly isn't something I crave long term. For some foods, it felt like it was spicy just for the sake of being spicy (to live up to its hype and name, if that makes any sense). While i love spice as much as the next girl, there's a time and a place for everything, if ya know what i mean. The name currently escapes me, but we ordered some type of seafood medley (pic attached), and it was great. Super fresh, succulent, with deep intense and fully fleshed out flavor. Highly recommend that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ugly-baby-brooklyn-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They have a open kitchen and we noticed a grandma in the back making the food, so we knew we were in for a treat. I would assume they change the menu every season because we were presented with their winter menu! I'm going to post pictures of all the dishes we orders with a description of the taste below.

We got the chu chee, kao tod, and tom kati. I thought the kao tod was my favorite bc it had so many different flavors and textures in one dish and the perf amount of spice (aka more spicy than most thai restaurants I've been to). My bf liked the chu chee the most but I thought it was okay (other than the curry which was delicious).

The Pork Belly was cooked perfectly with a deliciously warm sauce that was perfect for cutting the heat from the rest of the meal.

We had one other item, it was almost like a salad and it comes with and egg but you mix it all up - can't find it anywhere and I ordered it because I looked over at another table and said ""and that!"" to our waitress.

It wasn't quite as spicy as I remembered (which is a good thing, also perhaps because I got a Thai iced tea this time to help with the spice). The spare ribs we got were amazing. The meat was tender, the broth was flavorful with just the right amount of spiciness and it was delicious to eat over rice. The squid with shrimp and egg yolk was also good, but I thought they overdid it with the fish sauce and it was a little bit on the salty side. The flavors were great, but I thought needed to be toned down a notch. The egg omelette was also good. The spicy sauce that it came with was delicious, a perfect mixture of spicy and tangy. The egg I thought was just a little bit over fried (edges were brown and just a little bit too crispy). Overall, our experience the second time around didn't quite live up to par as the first (although everything was still delicious). I think the ordering system they have where you have to order a few days ahead of time makes it hard because you might not be in the mood for what you ordered a few days ago, and they don't let you make adjustments to your order.

Ben G.,/user_details?userid=31LIXxm02DpXpamib1BMQw,"New York, NY",9/25/2022,5.0,This place is insanely good and may be the best thai restaurant I've been to in NYC.

Tania S.,/user_details?userid=ZR_3RxjixTbSMqbrcdz-TA,"Yorktown Heights, NY",1/16/2021,4.0,"I was really excited to try Ugly Baby. Driving in from Queens, the plan was to get takeout and eat in the car. I think the rating would have been higher if we had eaten at the restaurant. We ordered the khao soi. The broth came in a soup cup, the noodles in a paper box and the veggies, sauce, crisps, lime, etc. in another paper box. It was really hard to assemble in the small cup they gave. The broth was delicious, but it was really spicy. The crisps managed to stay crunchy and feel light and not greasy, which was definitely a plus. The beef was super tender. Each individual component was pretty phenomenal. I just wish I was able to mix it the way it was meant to, in a proper bowl.

Casie N.,/user_details?userid=pMzg6ccZ0SrIUxTyBe0owA,"Los Angeles, CA",10/21/2018,4.0,Delicious but most things here are super spicy!!! The khao Soi was one of the better ones I've had but it burned my mouth off. We got this other salad which had fun texture but it was very lemony and spicy. This place opens at five and there is usually a line to get in then.

They pride themselves on serving authentic Thai food not your usual pad thai or drunken noodles. The waiters are very patient and will walk through the menu with you. They give their advice on which dishes to get and what to pair with what. They also inform you the spice level of all their dishes. I had the Khao Soi Nuer and the shrimp curry (I don't remember the thai name). The Khao Soi is beef shank with egg noodles delicious but SPICY, and just in case it's not spicy enough for you they give you some spicy paste for an extra kick. The noodles were stretchy and soft. The shrimp curry was my favourite. It was mildly spicy but it was the sauce of the curry that I enjoyed. It tasted like there was a hint of coconut milk and maybe basil. Paired well with the rice. Excellent overall.The decor itself is quirky and fun with lots of colors and colorful menus as well.

They warn you of the spiciness with a scale of 1-10 for the dishes but in all honesty if you're Asian and have familiarized your taste buds with mala Xiang Guo etc it won't be as spicy as they warn you. That doesn't take away from the deliciousness though, the squid and shrimp dish was an assault on your tastebuds at first bite, salty,sweet and slightly spicy it's one of those dishes that can make you finish a bowl of rice. Personally it got a bit too salty for me so it's a good dish to share. My fav was the pineapple mushroom curry, it has layers of flavor, the end note is a sweet pineapple ginger taste that works great with the mushrooms. I loved this dish. Their award winning Khao Soi looked pretty enough, smelled amazing too. Drizzle with fresh lime and mix it all up together and there's a party in your mouth.

We ordered the khao soi nuer and Kang ho (red curry paste with shoulder pork, spare ribs, and thin noodles.) everything was pretty much sharing portions. They served us the khao soi first. I had it before in Bangkok and in the city, but never had it this spicy before. It didn't even look spicy, but the first bite literally taste like fire. The waiter said spicy, but had no idea it was going to numb my taste buds. Overall great dish, but would just ask them to turn the spice level next time. By the time the 2nd dish came out, our mouth was already too numb to taste anything. For someone who loves spicy food, this was definitely a whole new experience for me.

Anita L.,/user_details?userid=kpSRHwJW_9v_ZCJ1OTDotw,"New York, NY",3/1/2020,3.0,"New York's a mecca when it comes to Thai restaurants so you've gotta be pretty extraordinary to standout in this crowded field. Â We had the Kang Tae Po Pla Sala (queenfish), Kang Ho (pork shoulder + glass noodles), Pla Tod Kamin (fried tumeric sea bream) and another pork dish, plus a bottle of dry riesling. Â Apparently the spice levels at Ugly Baby can Â reach extreme levels so although we enjoy some heat on our food we appreciated the waitress's advice and recommendations in selecting a combination of medium to less spicy dishes this time around. Â We could probably have handled adding a high heat dish, in retrospect, to the mix. Â All the dishes were extremely flavorful in true Thai food fashion but unfortunately we found all of the meat to be overcooked and dry. Â The fried fish gets a pass because it was cooked the way it typically is but for the other dishes it was a disappointment. Â I don't think I'll return because it was pretty ordinary and somewhat just fine. Â We tend to try new Thai restaurants these days unless there's a reason for us to go back (like outstanding, maybe unique food, close proximity to where we are at the time).

So, you can find anything in NYC and I sure did. The Kaho Soi was only beef based, not the chicken leg I was expecting, but I was still into it. The coconuty broth, spicy ick, pickled things and fresh onions bleneded really well with the noodles. The flavor overall was pretty on par with my favorite rendition in Chaing Mai. However, two small misses here-the dish was more nooddle heavy than I was expecting. In Thailand this was more of a soup with some noodles, here it was a noodle dish with some broth. Also, I ordered and was immediately told by the staff that it was very spicy. I said I preferred the spice level to be whatever the chef thought it should be and I like spice. It was almost a small argument that I should ask for it more mild, it I refused as I love a good spice. If your eyes almost tear up and your nose just starts to run, it's the right amt of spice.

Gloria W.,/user_details?userid=4rONHqj9YrAVgfol4y6UdQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/22/2018,5.0,Awesome hole in the wall spot. There is always a wait there. Sign your name with the host before you browse the neighborhood. Very authentic thai food. Staffs are friendly. Listen when they say their spicy food is a super spicy. Not just a sprinkle of jalapeno. Buy a milk base drink to calm down the kick lol. They have a few non spice options available.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ugly-baby-brooklyn-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Sylvia L.,/user_details?userid=p2qsU49DvbMrcG_nlejnuA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/30/2017,5.0,"Tucked away in a quiet block is this sleepy gem! If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen! This is one of reward LEGIT THAI restos in NYC! Many Thai places over the years have ""American-ized"" to suit the American palate. But I believe true Thai food should not have to compromise it's identity. This place focuses on food from different regions and uses curry plays and powder, peppercorns, chili's to reflect that properly. Here you won't get glorified spicy sweet pad thai, pad see ewwwww that the average American is used to. Here you get it the way true Thais eat and I loved it for THAT! The wait was 45 minutes on Friday evening at 7:45. So we took a stroll up and down Smith while waiting. We got back at 8:25 and our hostess said or table was paying and would be ready in a row. Perfecto! The tiny restaurant only seats maybe 25 people between its tables and bar seating. While we were waiting folks that walked out seemed happy and had burning mouths! Good sign!!! We were seated and ordered pretty quickly. At first we were worried that food would take forever because two large party tables just sat before us but we were pleasantly surprised. Another plus at the moment is its BYOB. We brought a bottle of bubbles and that complimented the food very well. The Laab Ped Udon (Spicy Duck Salad) was simple with its chunks of duck that were generously dry marinaded with HEAT! There wasn't a whole lot of sauce which led you to believe it wasn't too hot. The cucumbers, cabbage and string beans that it came with were great to scoop up the duck. After two bites the heat started building. The mushroom pineapple curry came just in time.for me to need to quench the fire in my mouth. When I thought the coconut milk in the mushroom pineapple curry would help calm the fire in my mouth it actually added to the fire!!! But the taste..the taste was Oh so amazing between the tofu which soaked up the sweetness of the pineapple and the actual curry sauce being just sweet enough for it to be fragrant but not too sweet! Â But as the heat intensified I found table loving it more and more. The Tom Som Plaza Kra Kong (snapper) came just in time before I stuck my whole face in the mushroom pineapple curry and slurped up all that sauce! The snapper was simple but reflective of the basic flavors of ginger and tamarind. This actually helped calm the fire down a bit but it had a more subtle heat. The soup that it came with was clean and refreshing! My mouth was burning up but I still wanted more. When the Kang Ho (northern dry Hung Le and red curry paste with pork shoulder, spare ribs and ming bean noodles) came out, that was a nice finisher. That had some heat too but the sticky rice and pork rinds helped! After having all that and then going back to the spicy duck salad, and rotating all over again between the various dishes, the flavor and spices in these dishes made us almost finish everything!! Normally when I have champagne I get buzzed but with last night's spicy dishes, this was the perfect combo!!!! We def want to go back to try the other dishes soon!!! Stay true to your identity!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ugly-baby-brooklyn-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The great ratings from others are accurate! The food here is so flavorful, perfectly spicy and portioned well. There was a little bit of a wait on Friday evening when we went and it was a little hard trying to get someone's attention to get on the list bc there's no host stand but once we got seated service was quick and good. We ordered the black bean muffins, the turmeric fried fish, the pork shoulder and the ground pork in peanut sauce with noodles. The fried fish was crispy and well seasoned, served with lemon to squeeze over the top. My husband's pork shoulder with glass noodles was spicy and flavorful. The pork was tender and not too fatty. I loved the ground pork and peanut sauce dish. The noodles are the perfect vehicle to the thick peanut sauce! I wasn't sure if I would like the black bean muffins (my husband's selection) but they came out hot and with a sweet and sour sauce that made them a great appetizer. We brought wine bc the restaurant doesn't have their own liquor license, others saw and made runs to the store while waiting for their seats.

Unfortunately my experience did not live up to expectations set by the reviews here. The food is interesting but inedible, the wait was long, the door person not hospitable, the menu was not understandable.

I am Korean-American, which means my spice tolerance is generally higher than that of white people, but this is pretty next level. It's spicier than Som Tum Der and definitely spicer than Uncle Boon's. I mean, have you ever had curry noodle soup that puts your tongue on fire in the first spoonful? I was sitting next to a table of South Asian people who were just picking at their pork shoulder, which our server warned us was ""10/10"" spicy (we didn't order it). That should give you an idea of how spicy we're talking. We all left with holes in our stomachs. The beef noodle soup was practically inedible, to be honest. That said, I loved the shrimp and squid with salted egg yolk, which was also very spicy, but bearably so, and our non-spicy fried fish was very good. Uncle Boon's is still my favorite Thai place in the city.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ugly-baby-brooklyn-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Ann G.,/user_details?userid=3wEmvrWVYwzdEZv9XN8Dhg,"South Glastonbury, CT",10/30/2019,1.0,"I went to this place after reading the interesting write-ups. Â I was very disappointed in much of it. Â I love exotic food, the more different usually the more I love it. Â I wanted to order two things, grilled pork tongue and this pork belly dish that they are known for. Â The young waitress told me right from the get-go not to order the pork tongue because it takes 15 minutes, she would not order it for me. Â My question is why is it on the menu? Â I ordered another dish which was some kind of grilled intestines. Â Then she literally fought with me and insisted I would not like the pork belly because it would be too hot for me. Â I have no idea why she would think this? Â My guess is she is a bigoted millennial who thinks people with gray hair cannot hack hot food. Â I became very angry and insisted that is the dish I came there for and wanted to order it. Â She never came to my table again after this very bad encounter. Â I like hot food but not when it is the only flavor, I want to be aware that I am eating fish, foul meat or vegetable. Â Hot for the sake of only hot to me is not quality prepared food. Â The pork tongue was okay but really just hot and the pork belly was hot and very greasy to the point it made me nauseous. Â I think it would have been helped if there were some absorbant vegetables or noodles in the dish to cut the grease. Â So all and all to me this place is just a novelty to prove that hot dishes can be made in all forms. Â I have had plenty of Thai food both bad and very good and this place is not up there on my list because the service was horrible and the food was nothing to write home about. Â For the small portions of food that kind of all taste the same (hot), in a divey type of atmosphere with terrible discriminatory service and a long subway ride from Manhattan it still cost me over $40 which is ridiculous. Â I have no craving to return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ugly-baby-brooklyn-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

King K.,/user_details?userid=9yJ5wfLkc8ohHHcsMshG7Q,"New York, NY",1/25/2018,5.0,"Very rarely do you get to go to a place that lives up to the hype. Well, Ugly Baby, which I had very high hopes for, actually exceeded my expectations. The restaurant itself looks like an abandoned rectangular space with a kitchen installed in the back. Only about 12 tables, you'll most likely have to wait when you come here. But trust me, it is most definitely worth it. The Tue Ka Ko (which are basically coconut cakes) are sweet and a have a tiny kick to them, great way to start your meal. Get the Kao Tod Nam Klook (fried rice with pork, peanuts and ginger) as an appetizer for everyone to share. This dish definitely has a little kick, but luckily, all the waiters are on top of their game with water, knowing your mouth is bound to burn at some point. We then had the Mee Kati Isan (Noodles with Curry sauce). This has to be the mildest dish on the menu. It still has a little kick, but nothing compared to everything else. We finished with the Khao Soi Nuer (curry noodle soup). This dish was excellent. Yes, I was breathing flames while eating it, but if you eat it at a reasonable pace (not an animal like me) you realize the spice makes it so tasty, and is not there to try to intentionally burn your mouth off. Saw a bunch of people order the pork leg, which looked incredible. Will be going back not only to order that pork leg, but to try other dishes. Easily the best new restaurant in NYC, but definitely not for the faint of heart.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/ugly-baby-brooklyn-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I went with a number of friends and ate about half the menu. Nothing disappointed. The only thing I wouldn't reorder is the duck. Too spicy for me, which is relatively hard to accomplish. It was fun to try a little as a group, but it makes it harder to taste the other amazing things, like the snapper. Oh, how I dream of you. The only thing that was strange, and maybe I was just unlucky or reading into something, but all of the people dined with were white. I am not. It seemed they were better served. The server would fill up their waters and leave mine empty. They would ask everyone if things were well, but never me. I had to flag them down to order another dish and have my water refilled (multiple times) and it took forever despite the fact they kept coming to the table, just not to me. It was strange and as usual with these things, couldn't tell if it was because I am black or not.

Perfectly cooked steak at right temperature and amazing quality too (you can actually still totally taste that it is wagyu with all the fulfilling and guilty fatty flavors). They said they sous vide the meat before making them into the katsu, which proved to give great results. My friend got the pork one so I got to taste a piece too, also really well prepared but I would vote for the wagyu.

For the main course, the pasta dishes are very impressive, they are simple but the texture of the pasta is perfect. The salmon main dish comes on a bed of salad, it was also very well made and has a great balance of taste but not quite as unique as the pastas. Service is attentive overall, although the mains took a while to arrive.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Lucy M.,/user_details?userid=siMTjT_lFs6PkAqytrDSHA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/21/2021,5.0,"Locanda Verde is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Â I love the food, the vibe, and the service. Â It's definitely one of those restaurants you go on a special occasion since it is quite pricey, but the food is so worth the money. Â I've tried a bunch of dishes before, but some of my favorites are the beet salad which is probably the best beet salad you will ever have. Â The green sauce with the sheep's milk yogurt and pistachio is out of this world. Â Additionally, I love their pastas even though I am not a huge pasta fan. Â A stand out is the crab spaghetti which had so much flavor from the red chili in the dish. Â As for the secondi dishes, I love the duck breast which is cooked to just the right temperature and is so juicy and delicious in your mouth.

I was hopeful that the positive reviews would not steer me wrong. We made sure to be at the restaurant 10 minutes prior to our reservation at 9:30 pm. We waited 30 minutes and had to confront the hosts two times in order to ensure that efforts were being made to seat us. While waiting, the hostess ensured that the staff would bring an entree to compensate for our long wait time. The food was very good. I wish I could say the same about the customer service. We confronted the hostess Gracie about the lack of delivery when it comes to the entree that should have been sent to the table. Her response was less than impressive as she stated, ""Okay. I will let them know."" I would hope that this restaurant would employ more customer-service oriented personnel at such a reputable restaurant.

We were almost immediately shown to a little curbside house that ultimately became our private dining room. Despite the considerable chilly wind gusting outside, our little bubble remained warm and cozy throughout our meal and our servers who had to come out in the cold were always. extremely attentive. The food was first class throughout. I had the cacio e pepe pasta, an absolutely excellent version of a dish that I've had several times before at different locations.

I work across the street and it's been on my list to try for a while. The place is small and you need a reservation for a table for lunch although bar seating is available for walk-ins. I only ordered one thing - grandmother's ravioli. My grandmother actually did make ravioli. And this dish was nothing like what grandma would do. The ravioli itself is miniature in size - a square of just over 1 inch per side. You get a bowl of only 10 or 12. There is the tiniest bit of meaty something in the center - probably the size of a peanut m&m. The meat itself isn't particularly tasty. And this is $28. Grandma's ravioli should be large and well stuffed, delicious and served in a bowl you can't hope to finish. 0 for 3. On the plus side the tomato sauce was delicious.

Ben T.,/user_details?userid=Zas1lZIBfv9ysns4-1wI9w,"ASTORIA, NY",11/25/2021,3.0,"Food was great, service was good. What ruined it was the manager. We were here for Thanksgiving and we were seated about 30-45 mins after our reservation. Despite this, within minutes of paying the bill the manager came over to our table and gave us a very fake ""how was everything?"" before she tried to kick us out to make space for other customers. Everything about her attitude was wrong. As someone who worked at a Danny Meyer restaurant for 8 years I know what good service is and this was the opposite. Very pushy and no people skills whatsoever.

To start, my boyfriend and I shared the blue crab crositini which had tomato compote and jalapeÃ±os on top. It was delicious and a really generous portion of crab. Then we shared the lamb meatball sliders. They were delicious. For my entree, I ordered the paccheri pasta which was made in a ragu sauce and provolone. It was amazing.

Â In fairness, I could not tell how much of my experience last night was due to a more widespread and partly understandable ""coming-back-from-Covid"" recovery - one in which the restaurant, the people in the kitchen and the people front of house, are all still getting back on the saddle. With that however, the decline in experience was highly noticed. Focaccia Napoletana arrived tepid and soggy. A cacio e pepe was as though the chef over-salted the pasta water and forgot that the cheese used is inherently salty. The garlic chicken flavor was ok but lacked the crispiness afforded by a good last few minutes in the over (it was JUST cooked through). The highlight was Evan, the wine guy, who was welcoming, informed and genuinely passionate about Sicilian whites. I am so sorry to say that the whole experience seemed soulless, a hustle and bustle of machine-like motions designed to get food, in whatever form, to the diners. I know Carmellini's work and what he and his restaurant's are capable of. As a native Italian, I am hopeful they can take feedback on and double down on attention and focus returning to the days of more sublime experiences.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered Ricotta as an appetizer. Everything was delicious, although the cod originally was too salty. The chef made us a new one and it was perfect.

Elizabeth R.,/user_details?userid=A0ViSnCdC3xklbh0bt-JjQ,"Winston-Salem, NC",8/15/2017,1.0,"We stopped into this restaurant given its 4-star reviews after a long day of walking the NYC streets. Â It has a beautiful appearance and was initially an okay experience. Â We waited at the bar with wine and one of the bartenders asked if we would like a spot at the bar for dinner if that opened up. Â Given how hungry we were, we accepted. Â After about 30 minutes we were told that they had space for us at the other end of the bar. Â En route we take our name off the dining room list only to find on arrival to the other end that there is only one barstool. Â We were then told that when others left that we would be seated together. Â After what seemed like an eternity of waiting and another glass of wine later we decided to check on the dining room wait with the host saying that he would ""do what I can"" despite there being multiple empty tables and approaching closing time. Â Needless to say we were never seated in the dining room. Â Finally, a spot opened up at the bar. Â The service after this was horrendous. Â Not once did the bartenders (who were overhead saying that there were a lot of open tabs and that it would be a good night for them) check on us to see if we would like more wine, ask if they could get us anything or even ask how the food tasted (2 apps and 2 entrees). Â The person bringing food from the kitchen seemed to be the most pleasant person there! Â The food was fine but nothing to write home about. Â However, perhaps we were jaded by the incredibly poor service. While we were visiting, I can promise you that we will never return to this restaurant again and have been sharing the word with all friends that may visit the city. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere as Laconda Verde is not deserving of your attention or money.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Lisa D.,/user_details?userid=EWv2bU_N39SnnhCaQb921w,"Los Angeles, CA",4/14/2016,3.0,"I gave a 3 stars because the ambiance averaged out the disappointment with the meal. I had heard so much about this place, but wasn't so impressed-- the mushroom crostini was decent but a bit salty. The skate was very bland and the dessert- apricot cheesecake was just off. The waiter did recommend a great red wine, which made the experience much better.

Jaspreet W.,/user_details?userid=IpjtFU5HO54CQW3lbq5IMA,"New York, NY",10/2/2018,5.0,"Wow. I'm at a loss for words. This restaurant is incredible. Visited on a Saturday night (call waaaay ahead of time for a reservation) at 9:45 PM. Was seated right away as we had a reservation. Upon being seated, I finally had a chance to look around the restaurant and appreciate the ambiance. Dimly lit, intimate, and perfect for the occasion I was there for- anniversary dinner. We started with the ricotta and crostini, and the octopus. Both were simply amazing. Must order in my opinion. Their house Prosecco was absolutely delicious as well. For our main entree, we split a mafaldine verde pasta. This was so tasty and flavorful. The ground sausage was what made the dish spectacular IMO, but both the sauce and noodles were excellent. We finished with a stone fruit cheesecake, which was, again, spectacular. This restaurant is magnificent and we will definitely be back in the future!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Disappointed that one of my favorites is no longer the same and has downgraded the quality and taste of many of its dishes... luckily for my boyfriend he ricotta is still the same.

Had to wait a little bit for a table but enjoyed wine at the bar and the wait was worth it. MUST TRY the sheep milk ricotta- i know everyone else recommends it too but it is literally that delicious. my friend got the pasta with duck and i had the pumpkin tortelli and it was phenomenal. the chocolate sourdough dessert also was amazing-never had anything like it. not a thing touched my lips tonight that i did not LOVE. cannot wait to go back again. so good!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Essentially trendy, upscale modern Italian restaurant featuring some very classic and eclectic dishes. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, including the burrata, arancini, and prawns. The prawns was our favorite appetizer. I got the paccheri octopus pasta for dinner, it was delicious!

Laura J.,/user_details?userid=JNY_D2b-RYJ-Y0o6gssAUA,"New York, NY",5/11/2019,3.0,"Have been wanting to try this place for a long time and have to say I was INCREDIBLY disappointed. I'd be remiss not to give credit where credit is due: The food was incredibly delicious but the experience left me with a very bad taste in my mouth and I won't be back. I decided to take a risk and bring a client here for lunch, booking a 12PM reservation. We were immediately sat and the service was attentive, so everything started well. Being the first warm day of summer we elected to both have wine and decided to share the ricotta appetizer (also ordering our mains at the same time). Both the wine and the ricotta arrived quickly and we enjoyed them but after an additional 30 minutes I had to flag the waiter down to ask about our mains. I was offered no apologies or explanations, he simple offered to check on the status. Fast forward another ten minutes, still no mains and no explanation form our server, and this song and dance continued until 1hr and 15 minutes into our lunch the mains arrived after repeated requests and attempts to get our servers attention, and we both had to ask for them ""to go"" as we had to leave in the next 5 minutes to make our respective meetings. I get that mistakes happen and the Kitchen may have gotten slammed. What bothered me was we were never offered an apology and no one seemed to take seriously our repeated requests to accelerate the service of our main course. It was embarrassing for me with my client, so wouldn't be able to take a chance on these guys again despite the delicious food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered the omelette, pasta, and pancakes. In particular, (this may sound weird amongst all the other delicious dishes) the omelette was my absolute favorite. It was fluffy but moist, and the cheese oozed out of the layers of eggs. Positioned next to the omelette was a bundle of arugula mixed in a truffle vinaigrette, and this provided the dish with some freshness and a cool bite that complemented the warm omelette. I also loved the pasta, which was cooked to al dente and mixed with melt-in-your-mouth shreds of duck!

We got one sorbet! One scoop is $10, are you kidding me? They had three flavors on the menu so we assumed that it will be three scoops, but nope one scoop! I don't think that was remotely close to being right. We asked the waiter and he said ""yup just one scoop"".

When I asked the waiter why is it pink on the inside they said that they were unable to cook it all the way without being dried out.

The lamb meatball sliders had bitter tomato sauce and no noticeable cheese on them, just spicy lamb. I wanted to like this place but on both occasions I'd say the food was overpriced and the service just so-so. I have never seen so many bus boys in a restaurant I think there were 15 and they were much more helpful than the waiter, it was hard to get his attention. The onion focaccia was tasty but my boyfriend doesn't like onions and that was the only bread served. The wine was good, a nice selection.

Small things like taking the empty dirty plates, checking on the wine, fulfilling some simple ""special requests"" (like a candle for a bday cake) is a given in any decent restaurant (esp if its trying to be a fine dining place).

I say 'looked like' because everyone was happy enough with what they got that there was little sharing going on until the very end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
James K.,/user_details?userid=nQjgUGEBOu-jsCQlp43WGA,"El Cerrito, CA",4/8/2013,5.0,I came to Locanda Verde again for breakfast and this time a friend and I ordered the waffle and French toast dishes. The French toast was probably the best I've ever had. The sweetness was just right and not too much. The waffle was also very delicious with a great texture that went well with the apples. This is now my favorite place for breakfast food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jessica G.,/user_details?userid=ayrUmM0wy9VNCP17KQfHGA,"Manhattan, NY",5/21/2017,5.0,"We had a remarkable dinner at Locanda Verde. We arrived on a Friday night around 10pm and the place was full. There was even a waitlist for a bar-seat. Luckily, we had a reservation but did have to wait a while after a reservation time which was fine. They had a great cocktail menu with a couple of Mezcal selections which was a plus for me. My bf ordered a nice scotch and commented that the Scotch selection was satisfactory as well. Once sat, the service was good although the experience was a little faster than I would have hoped for. This is one of those restaurants that the chef requires you put in your full order at once apps/dinner/desert. We really don't like that style because we like to pace our own meals but I understand why they do this to ensure turn over time for reservations. The food was great but by the time we were finishing up the restaurant was empty (around 11pm). The apps and entrees were brought out right on top of each other as we feared they would be but they were delicious so we aren't taking any points off for that. We would return to this restaurant but maybe for happy hour instead of dinner. I would like to try a less formal meal there like drinks and apps at the bar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Great service, great food. The food is still great but the service has really taken a turn for the worse. It took 25 minutes to get our cocktails and the waitress was difficult to flag down when we needed something. I also found it really annoying that we couldn't order appetizers first THEN entrees. We had to order everything all at once which I hate doing because they never course it correctly. While the food is still great, I don't think I'll be back as the bad service has soured the experience.

Mark S.,/user_details?userid=NpkckFueBkQcrO7O_V55Gg,"Rocky Point, NY",5/28/2019,3.0,"Great Space-open & airy and nicely decorated. We went for Brunch this past Sunday. Sunday is a good day to go as there's a lot of parking near by. They gave us a nice table near the windows with one side having very comfortable padded seating and the other having these very hard plastic seats which were not comfortable. Also, the restrooms are down two flights of stairs. We started with a Bloody Mary and the Tre Stelle with Prosecco. The Bloody Mary is advertised to come with ""italian hot peppers"" but only came with one very tiny sliver of a pepper & the drink itself lacked heat. We ordered our appetizer and main courses but sadly they all arrived at the same time. Our waitress stated that she thought we wanted everything at the same time (which we did not)! We decided not to send anything back. For an appetizer we had the Sheep's Milk Ricotta with Truffle Honey which was very good. For our main courses we had the Eggplant Sandwich & the Uova in Pergatorio (egg in pergatory). Both were really good however the egg in pergatory only came with two pieces of toast which is not enough. Luckily, there was bread left over from the Ricotta. We also had an order of crispy garlic potatoes as a side which were delicious.

Cindy R.,/user_details?userid=cdg72MCLRH3tertErCusJA,"Littleton, MA",10/25/2017,5.0,"While in Manhattan in September, celebrating Sister's birthday, we had a wonderful dinner at Locanda Verde. Everything about this meal was fantastic, starting with the warm atmosphere of the space. It was very inviting. Our waitress was lovely, and after a mishap where she spilled one of the glasses of wine at our table, she worked overtime to make it up to us (which was unnecessary) with crazygreat service. We started our meal with a few appetizers, one of which was the delicious sheep's milk ricotta crostini. Even the standard bread basket that was brought to our table was excellent. My sister and I split the wood-fired garlic chicken for two entrÃ©e--it was amazing! It was roasted to perfection and packed a flavorful punch. And it was so plentiful, we brought home half of it and enjoyed it for breakfast the next morning! Because it was my sister's birthday and perhaps due to the wine mishap earlier, our waitress comped the three desserts we ordered, the best of which was the limoncello semifreddo, which was light and lemony and further complemented by fresh blueberries. The gelato sampler was fantastic, too. Based on all the items we tried, I don't think I'm going out on a limb to suggest you cannot go wrong with anything you order off the Locanda Verde menu. The wine list was impressive, but we chose to bring our own bottle of wine, for which there was a $35 corkage fee. In all, it was a delightful experience. I would definitely return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Â Maybe this place is already dunzo maybe it was just a place that was only good because it was in the past a place to be seen and say you have ""been there."" But in the words of Miranda priestly: ""why is everyone so disappointing!"" Â That is how I can sum up this restaurant. Â Not terrible but most definitely unable to live up to its foodie god like status. Â Everything was sub par from the appetizers to the gamey bland tasting lamb ragÃº to the cheese platter that tastes like it was fresh off kraft's assembly line. Nothing here was memorable nor worth what you paid for. Had it been a mid-level no name local neighborhood family restaurant, I would say it was good. Â However for the ""status"" this so called ""amazing"" restaurant has it falls under carrabas/Olive Garden status. Generic, bland, unmemorable, and most definitely not a second try. #sorrynotsorry #byefelicia.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My faves are the sheep's milk ricotta and the Uovo. Very unique and flavorful.

Dishes ordered included the squash crostini (nothing special), beetroot carpaccio (fine), tagliatelle (luke warm when served and zero flavor), bass (also luke warm and very ""fishy""), and the dark chocolate rice pudding (tasted lovely but horrendous presentation - the kitchen needs to reconsider how to plate this dessert or take it off the menu). Upon review of the bill, I noticed my aperitivo was a shocking $42. When I questioned the charge, our server sent a smug, condescending manager to confirm the charge was correct and perhaps I just wasn't aware of what I ordered; the mansplaining was neither appreciated nor helpful. What would have been helpful would have been a heads up from the bartender that the drink I ordered was going to cost $42 so I could have enjoyed a good laugh at the asinine pricing and ordered something else instead.

Jason P.,/user_details?userid=pcNlw_pRGi0YTZxvzq9rTg,"Chicago, IL",7/12/2017,4.0,"Started off with the burrata salad and was a lovely presentation. The cheese was delicious but think out of proportion with the only few beets on the plate. Also, I found the salad a tad bit salty, which was unexpected given the typical saltiness in the cheese and beets themselves. Still, good overall. For my entree I chose the Black Sea bass which was sweeter and creamier than expected but a great cut and perfectly cooked. Notably, the accompanying vegetables - squash and zucchini - stood on their own and were just the right tenderness (no small feat). I tried the Sassafrasso house cocktail, which is rye based. Nothing offensive but nothing special either. Wanted a light red with dinner and grignolino was chilled and a great complement to my fish. They slightly chill it, which I wish more restaurants would do with light reds. The atmosphere is excellent and I was pleased to see it jumping on a Wednesday night after 9 (I realize that's more customary in NYC than in most Chicago neighborhoods). Finally, the service was strong - I sat at the bar so perhaps that's a more likely outcome but a handful of competent male servers behind the bar who knew the menu and were sufficiently but not overbearingly attentive. I'd consider going back because there was nothing wrong with the meal but a) there was nothing stand-out about the food and b) there are too many other restaurants I'd try with a $125 bill (one person, drink, salad, entree, glass of wine, dessert and espresso).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Not my experience sadly. The special crostini was very odd. Salty apricots, hmmmm? The eggplant sandwich was a disaster. Hard, old bread and so messy and watery from the eggplant it was impossible to eat. Served on a small board so you couldn't come close to using a knife and fork. I tried and failed miserably.

The tagliatelle with lamb ragout is amazing and don't leave without trying the ricotta with honey...delicious. They also have a great sparkling rosÃ© if you're in the mood for a light, crisp one. I would say, however, they can be a little snotty (even for NYC) about waiting for tables. They won't let you leave a number for a call when your table is ready, but the bar is so small there's no where to sit and wait times can reach over two hours.

Upon being seated, we noticed that something had been spilled beneath our table and when we informed the person directing us (in case it was a hazard or they had missed it) we were treated like we were making a scene. Our first appetizer included a hair, our first drink without alcohol and our dishes were bland (except for one dish which was salted beyond being edible and we were told was made by the chef himself - as if to say it could not be bad). Were it not for our waiter (who was gracious and amazing beyond belief) and the bar tender who kept us happy with a seemingly endless stream of hot toddys we would have left quite upset.

LV came high recommended from my mom who visits weekly so we decided to check it out for a drink at the bar. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. The female bartender on Wednesday afternoon was miserable, didn't say hi when we sat at the bar, and didn't crack a smile the entire time we were there. Then we ordered the Crostina Of The Day and she forgot to mention that it had a fish spread on it along with raw salmon. Neither myself or the three ladies I was with like raw fish and when we told her that she didn't even apologize or offer to take any cost off our bill. We decided to tip because we aren't bad people but she truly didn't deserve one. It's a shame we had a terrible experience because the atmosphere was cute and drinks were good. I told the hostesses as we were leaving but am not sure if they ever relayed the message to the manager.

Rachel M.,/user_details?userid=kYSSR8JTiCIyj_u6AHjYtA,"Cobham, United Kingdom",12/3/2017,1.0,"I am in disbelief that I am giving the restaurant one star. Â To start off with my husband and I live two blocks from the restaurant and have been consistently going here for more than 6 1/2 years. Â  Â Food is always great, restaurant is buzzy and service is generally quite good. Â Last night we had a friend who came in from Rome that we were taking for dinner. Â You know we are confident in the experience here to be taking an Italian there. Â Our reservation was at 9:00 PM. Â We were sat around 10:15 PM. Â This was after the hostesses informed us upon arrival they were running ""a few minutes"" behind schedule We were told to have a drink in the hotel lobby which we did. Â  Each time we went to the hostess and maitre d' for an update we were told things from two tables just asked for their coats and you are the next table; to it is an extraordinary evening with people lingering at their tables. Â We dine all over the world and there is normally a set time for a table. Â We were told some people had been at their table for over 3 hours. Â After the consistent misinformation given to us finally the general manager came to where we were sitting in the hotel lobby. Â This was after an hour wait so far. Â He was apologetic and did not offer a solution until we pushed for one. Â We were FINALLY seated. Â The music was absolutely blaring and the choice of music really took any sort of sophistication the restaurant once held. Â Our starters were good. Â The main courses came except for my sister's fish. Â We waited about 5 minutes until we said something. Â Our Italian friend asked to speak to a manager and everyone seemed to be hiding from us and waiting for the fish. Â One of the managers finally came over with the fish when it was ready but it was about 11:45 PM at this point and my sister decided she did not want it any longer since we were basically done with our meal. Â Our server told us that the entire bill was paid for by the general manager. Â The gesture was the right thing to do but this experience left us quite baffled, embarassed and questioning whether we return to the restaurant again. The one star goes to the server who was not at fault at all and was very kind and tried very hard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The Jedi Foodi E.,/user_details?userid=_XxNSjq1W1AuLuQa73jchQ,"New York, NY",3/9/2010,4.0,"I normally would not write a restaurant review based on a brunch experience because I do not feel that a restaurant is fully represented menu-wise on Sunday from 11am - 3pm. But, if the food I had the pleasure of sampling at brunch is any indication of the items on the regular dinner menu, then I must make a return evening visit to Loconda Verde. Opened last year in the former Ago space at the swanky Greenwich Hotel, this Robert Deniro - Ken Friedman- Josh Pickard redux is the absolute quintessence of Tribeca chic. Meyer Davis Studios came in and completely renovated this vaulted cathedral to Italian bistro cooking. The room is loud and lively, features high ceilings, large windows, plush leather banquettes, and dark wood, giving it a very cozy airy atmosphere. A massive granite-topped, brasserie-style bar has been installed to promote a casual, tavern like feel. Mala and I had a 1:30 reservation and after a brief delay, we were seated in a corner banquette that gave us a glorious vista of the main dining room and its classy and fashionable clientele. The walk-in wait for a table is unfortunately long, partly in thanks to the reputations held by the kitchen's award winning chefs. Leading the charge is Andrew Carmellini (A Voce, Cafe Boulud, Le Cirque). He has assembled numerous gourmet treats to awaken the senses on a lazy Sunday morning including updated egg classics and new variations on pancakes and french toasts as well as hearty fare like Fire Roasted Garlic Chicken ($19). I ordered the Citronata brunch cocktail ($12); a refreshing blend of Aperol, Lillet and Aranciata. The warm focaccia presented as a starter was out-of-the-oven fresh and well balanced in earthy flavors. To drink with my meal, I ordered the Tre Stelle ($7). It is simply a blend of pomegranate, blood orange and Valencia orange juices. The taste was ultra sweet and robust and just what the doctor ordered to brighten my demeanor. Earlier, while waiting for our table, we saw an alluring bowl of pasta on another patron's table. After perusing the menu, we discovered it was the Bucatini with Pancetta Marinara ($17). I suggested that Mala select that as her main course and was she happy that I did so. The sauce was so authentically Italian that it transported me back to Calabria, dining with my cousins at the family table. Mala devoured it down as if she had gotten a tip on a pending famine. The service at Locanda Verde is exceptional. Our server Sarah was very pleasant and also quite patient as I had a few questions about the menu and the drinks. I ordered the Shaved Porchetta Sandwich with Grilled Onions and Provolone ($16). The pork tasted like it had been braised for months; so tender, savory and juicy. I think Chef Sara Jenkins (Porchetta) across town should start worrying about some serious competition. For dessert, there was only one simple choice to make. Pastry Chef Karen Demasco achieved fame from her tantalizing sweet creations at Tom Colicchio's flagship, Craft. Recently her Maple Budino with Candied Pecans and Apple Butternut Sorbetto ($9) was awarded Top 10 Things To Eat/Drink In NYC in TIME OUT NY which stated ""the creamy pudding, rich with cooked syrup flavor and topped with toasted, candied pecans, tastes of Autumn itself."" This dessert is, in a word, transcending. New York Magazine praises, ""Many a restaurant pastry chef dreams of opening up his or her own cozy bakery one day, far from the fast-paced restaurant fray. Karen DeMasco almost gets to fulfill that fantasy at Locanda Verde, where, in addition to sending out elegant plated desserts like her lush Maple Budino, she stocks a marble counter in the street side cafÃ© with all manner of mouthwatering breakfast and afternoon muffins, scones, tarts, and cakes. There's a menu-appropriate Italian cast to confections like crumbly Nutella cookies and moist streusel-topped fig muffins, but happily, DeMasco hasn't reined in all the homespun-American impulses that made her name at Craft. Want proof? There's her dense, aromatic pumpkin-spice bread; her delicate, barely sweet toffee-date cake; and, most compelling, her tender glazed apple-cider doughnut, a paragon of the form."" I could not agree more. Brunch for two with drinks, tax and tip was $90.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Melanie M.,/user_details?userid=1GCVw2bDsOjyXVbCKyFgGw,"New York, NY",7/4/2010,5.0,"Ricotta ricotta ricotta! After perusing other's Yelp reviews as well as the Locanda Verde mention in Travel & Leisure Magazine I knew immediately to order the ricotta crostini with truffle honey, orange, and rosemary, but i was not at all prepared for just how amazing this would taste. Cheese is normally dense and heavy, but this was no ordinary cheese. The texture had the lightest airiest sensation on my tongue and it was smoother and creamier than any ricotta that I've ever tasted before. The presentation was delightfully simple (just a sprinkling of rosemary, a shiny drizzle of truffle honey, and the beautiful dark char marks on the perfectly toasted bread), as were all the other plates. My zucchini frittata was a vibrant yellow circle, minimally topped with a 3 flashes of unbelievably sweet plum tomatoes, and hints of green from the zucchini skin. But I couldn't finish the frittata as I kept going back for more helpings of that ricotta. until I had polished off every last little smug of ricotta left on the plate. I loved the decor too. It made me feel comfortable without being bland or country. The pastry display looked ready for a food photo shoot, while the large windows allowed for ample sunlight to highlight the beautiful dark wood tables.

Decor is warm and market-bistro like. It's quite a scene. Lots of students at the bar and a mix of older people, hipsters and tourists at the tables. I would suggest going on a weeknight for the best crowd. I personally liked the older people and hipsters. Wine and beer is fairly priced but not the biggest pours. Food is unpretentious, with quite a few dishes made for two. I highly recommend the chicken. It is amazing... large, moist and flavorful with a nice sear on the skin. I know everyone does Brussels Sprouts but these are insane... a real standout. Servers are unpretentious and casual. My only complaint was my pumpkin ravioli could have been slightly larger and had more Sage and been even more decadent. Pretty damn good, though.

That ended today however when I had made a reservation a couple weeks in advance for 4. When we arrived we were sat at a table that could not and should not seat 4 adults. I asked the server for a possible relocation, to which she replied 'it'll be the same table somewhere else"" . This was a lie. We asked about a 4 top next to us and another and also 2 2 tops. She was dumbfounded. Â They were all empty. This was my daughters birthday and to be sat at a 4 top that couldn't accommodate 3 ppl is an embarrassment. Â There was no remedy by Mitch who apparently couldn't be bothered as he said nothing as we left. Â I spoke with Peter, who apparently was the manager, after we'd left and appraised him of what transpired. He was kind enough but we had already had a birthday brunch ruined. There was nothing I wanted except to relay to him what occurred and maybe retrain his front office staff how to accommodate in his absence. Â In my opinion it was an easy fix that was overlooked by a server and Mitch that didn't feel the need to make a simple change on our behalf. Alas, we went to another establishment but I wanted to share our experience and maybe you would consider somewhere else before you book this restaurant.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

And for the piece de resistance I split the garlic chicken for two, which had vegetables and potatoes. If a restaurant can do chicken well it is an indicator to me that they can do everything else and boy did Locanda Verde deliver.

They also seated us on a table that was sort of on a corner where waiters and people would knock into your chair as they passed. There were so many people at the bar, the noise was way way overboard. I had an arugula salad and ordered a fish dish (it was a while ago so I forget exactly which one). Both were good but I just wasn't blown away, especially for the price.

Great day Sat 1pm Waitress was uninterested and not at all helpful when trying to chose from the menu. plus it took about 20 plus min for us to be noticed! Remember I had dinner 2x here and absolutely loved it! Â Probably still myt fav dinner place in the city but defiantly NOT brunch. Had the sheep's milk ricotta & honey spread with toast as other yelpers recommended- that was fab! ordered the zucchini frittata- there was barely any zucchini and one tiny dime size drop of goat cheese. Barely satisfied and extremely plain tasting. I was disappointed. I could have made that at home. My boyfriend ordered Uovo Modenese - and he was not that excited about it either.

Tim  Q.,/user_details?userid=sjFPLvLAR9t2B8xAyWbVeQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/13/2010,2.0,I had a good experience here in the past but this time it was lousy. We made an 8:30 reservation on a Friday night almost two weeks in advance. We arrived 5 minutes later and was not seated until after 9pm. The bar was mobbed and one of our guests was pregs so it was annoying. When we finally did sit our party of 5 was put at what amounted to a table for 4. Grrr. The waitress was pleasant but had too much to do and so was extremely slow. The food was good especially the ravioli and lamb meatballs. I thought things had been redeemed and when the bill came we split it down the middle on 2 cards. The waitress charged both cards the full bill.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

She made reservations for 11:30 am, right when it opened and luckily was not packed (YET) so we got seated right away. For a Friday (almost) afternoon, I've yet to see a place so filled with people. I did hear however, it's a very VERY popular place! I loved the partially open kitchen, where you can see the chefs do their thing while eating. We started off with two cups of coffee and the waiter brought over their complimentary cheesy onion bread. BOY, was I in for a surprise...slightly hungover from the previous night, my taste buds are usually not up to par the next day, but THIS onion bread was DELICIOUS! So much so that I almost forgot about our entrees as I was eye-ing my sisters piece, which of course she gave to me out of love? sympathy? Whatever the case may be, extra onion bread for me! For our entrees, she ordered the sea bass special and I had the fresh pasta (I believe it was bolognese). Both our entrees were not large portion wise, so if one was super hungry, an appetizer would probably be best. As for the flavor, I didn't try her sea bass, but she loved it (picky eater). MY pasta however, AMAZING!! I'm not sure why some yelpers didn't like it, but it was def fresh pasta and not overly sauced. A good amount of meat, sauce, and pasta ratio wise in every bite. We had wanted to try one of their pastries early on, but when brunch was over (it was still REALLY early), they had run out of it!

Â But the stars of the show here at brunch are Karen De Masco's carb-filled creations that assault the senses of sight, smell and taste, all at the same time. Â The hazelnut crusted French Toast is a sight to behold, with its crusty exterior studded with hazelnuts and its just slightly underdone interior, all with an eggy sweet flavor that is balanced by an acidic salad of citrus fruits. Â One can be forgiven for lapsing into a food coma after a luxurious brunch like this, so when you leave the restaurant, don't feel too bad when you hear the frenetic sounds of a zumba dancing class being held in one of the overhead lofts above you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Â The space is really beautiful, on another occasion I would like to just come and hang out at the bar for a bit. Â We arrived on time for our reservation and were sat immediately. Â We started off with a bottle of wine and then moved to the appetizers, the arugula salad, the steak tartare, the crab and jalapeno crostini, and the sheep's milk ricotta was what the 4 of us ordered. Â Everything was exceptional although I have to say that the sheep's milk ricotta was pretty unreal, it has a whipped consistency to it that makes it really light to eat. Â The bread they serve with the ricotta and the tartare is fantastic. Â My other favorite was the tartare, I am a huge fan of steak tartare and this was definitely in my top 3 so far. Â The flavors worked very well together and everything was extremely fresh because there was absolutely no after taste what so ever. Â It was a very clean tasting dish. Â For dinner, we ordered the corn ravioli, the branzino, the pork chop, and the halibut. Â Also were very good and well executed dishes. Â I actually ordered the branzino but I think that the pork chop was the best thing at the table. Â They didn't overcook it and it is served medium or so, so it's extremely tender and juicy. Â Unfortunately after the entrees we were too full to order dessert.

Barbara S.,/user_details?userid=mV5Ey139Bj2coaSPTKXBCA,"Mill Valley, CA",10/24/2011,5.0,"During our recent stay at The Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca, we had almost all of our lunches and dinners at Locanda Verde. It didn't take long to realize that nowhere else can hold a candle to their delicious food. My husband is the type who hates to eat in the same place twice and even he agreed that this was a destination restaurant. Their flavors are bright and all of the dishes are highly inspired. Dishes we especially loved were the beet salad with fennel, the foccacia (bread) they give you to start, green pasta with white bolognese, lamb meatball sliders, sardinian and sheeps milk ricotta with fresh herbs and olive oil and grilled country bread, cheese plate, pasta with octopus, pasta with duck sausage, broccoli rabe (so good I had it with each meal! and I usually don't like broccoli rabe!). We also had a great chocolate dessert. If you're in that area, or if you're just anywhere in NYC, do yourself a favor and try Locanda Verde. The only downside is that it's noisy inside. If the weather is good there are several outdoor tables. If the weather is bad, it's worth checking into The Greenwich Hotel where they fast track their food to you in the drawing room. Great people watching at both the hotel and restaurant.

Jess K.,/user_details?userid=gjRvBu1th-YobqPwPTysJQ,"Pelham, NY",7/6/2009,3.0,"I have to say that my review of this place is the exact opposite of Veronique's. Â When thinking what I wanted to say about it, the terms ""most pretentious restaurant ever"" came to mind. Â I went here for my mom's birthday with some family and it was not the ultimate dining experience. Â We all ordered different appetizers and had wine and some mixed drinks between the 8 people who were there. Â They let us sit there for a long time waiting for the 8th person to arrive and the waitress didn't really become bitchy until later on in our meal. Â I enjoyed the pasta dish (with ragu sauce) that I ordered. Â I usually don't order pasta since I just don't love it but this looked good and I figured at an Italian restaurant it would be a success. Â I didn't regret that decision. Â However, my dad was fairly annoyed that he paid $23 for 4 scallops. Â He kept making fun of his dish and it was a little embarrassing but at the same time pretty funny. Â My mom ordered a dessert as did one other person at the table. Â Since we were a party of 8 the gratuity was included at a generous 20%. Â My uncle told us that that was ruled to be illegal (or perhaps just unenforceable?) in NY state but we didn't fight it. Â The service was sooo slowwww in this restaurant. Â Our waitress came across as being a mega-bitch after we had been there for a while but this other guy who was new there was super nice and kept coming over to us to check on things. Â I think our waitress could tell that we weren't upper class NYers (perhaps just middle class NYers) and she seemed pretty annoyed with the existence of our table. Â They brought us more of the delicious pizza-type bread when we asked for it but just putting out plain bread would cut down on their overhead and be just as effective. Â We just needed something to munch on while waiting for our food to arrive. Â  Â It was really a rollercoaster of an experience (and most likely not worth the $510 price tag) so that is why I will stick with three stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Rex R.,/user_details?userid=yyuM6W2rpjym9YaCoKgH4Q,"New York, NY",11/2/2011,5.0,"Wow, the 1 month wait to get a reservation here was so worth it. I've been hearing a lot about Andrew Carmellini's spot for quite some time now and I finally had a chance to check it out. Â This place was packed on a Friday night. That being said, the noise level was very loud but we didn't mind. Â I strongly recommend trying the Sheep's Milk Ricotta, hands down the highlight of my entire meal. Â Apparently it was white truffle week in NYC so were given the option of having those glorious little shavings on everything on the menu. Â Needles to say, the truffles made the ricotta crostini even better then it was already. Â We also tried the lamb meatball sliders (2 small sliders in portion) which I thought were delicious. I also enjoyed the Pappardelle Verde. As for the dinner, I had the steak which was a special for the evening while my wife had the fish. We made the mistake of ordering too much food by the time our entrees came out so I couldn't finish it all but I really did enjoy both the fish and steak. On to the only thing we didn't really like, the dessert. I believe it was the La Fantasia di Caramello. The flavors did not seem to go well and my wife also agreed. She made a point of telling me I made a mistake ordering it. SORRY SORRY SORRY!

L S.,/user_details?userid=KHZsBBgcMCnXPI2w_bMp2A,"Atlanta, GA",10/19/2012,4.0,"I really wanted to award 5 stars but since the Hostess scolded us like we were preschoolers at one point during our meal, I dinged them a star for that. We of course couldn't get a reservation on a Thursday night so we decided to walk in and try our luck. My date arrived early and held court at the bar. I strolled in a bit after 8, grabbed a perfect Manhattan and joined him in the bar area. The place was jammed so standing anywhere in the restaurant definitely had it's challenges but my drink was so yummy I didn't mind. We only had to wait about 30 minutes, which was perfectly acceptable to me. We were seated at a table where I sat on the bench and my date was across from me. Well this restaurant is excruciatingly loud and we couldn't hear anything the other was saying. I suggested that he join me on my side of the table and the thing that I liked was that there is enough space between tables where this wasn't a problem. I'm all of about 100 lbs and my date is about 5'7"" and thin. Here comes the annoyance. we were enjoying our conversation when about 20 minutes into our move the Hostess came over and told us that we couldn't sit that way. Now I know that neither of the tables on either side of us complained as they still had plenty of room. What do they do with fat people? Tell them they're too large to sit on the bench? IRKSOME!! The rest of the meal was close to perfection. The cheesy bread they serve to start is warm and crusty, the service is punctual and the food divine. We decided to just order wine by the glass as we had already had a few cocktails, I the Renato Ratti Nebbiolo D'Alba 2010 and my date the Foradori Teroldego Rotaliano 2009. Both glasses were great but I was partial to mine. To start we ordered the Blue Crab with jalapeno and tomato crostini which was incredible. Next we moved on to the Burrata with broccoli rabe, peperonata and pine nuts and it might have been the best burrata I've ever had. I've been wanting to try this restaurant for the 3 years I've lived in this great city but never wanted to try the walk in approach but man is it worth it. My friends that have been insisted I try the Fire-Roasted Garlic Chicken for Two Â and they did not steer me wrong. This was perfect and HUGE! The skin was crispy, the meat moist, an extra garlic kick and all served with roasted vegetables. We may be small but we can eat and I don't even feel like we put a dent in it before we cried uncle and had them wrap it up. This is definitely one of my new fav places minus the scolding Hostess.

I had requested that they be seated in the court yard since they both really enjoy dining outdoors. I had spoken to the restaurant on 2 occasions to confirm the reservation and was never told that the court yard was reserved for hotel guests only. Since the court yard was the main reason I had chosen the restaurant it was very disappointing when my wife and daughter arrived and were not allowed to sit in the court yard. In addition the hostess was rather rude in the way she told them. While the food was pretty good the over all experience was a lot less then expected.

I lived in NYC for over ten years and love going out to eat and trying new spots. This was my second time back so I feel I can finally review it. The hostesses are the rudest I have ever encountered in any dining experience. If you ask a question, they laugh at you and roll their eyes. I felt compelled to write a review bc I do not understand how this place is still so busy. It is not that great. Last time I went for my sister in law's 35th bday. They brought all our food out cold and forgot her meal. Not only did they not apologize at all, they then brought out her new meal cold and raw too with again, no apologies at all. We were in shock. They just didn't seem to care at all. After brining out cold, undercooked food we all sat there with empty wine glasses and water glasses. We finally said something and the manager came over and didnt seem to care that much either. I do not get it at all. When this has happened at other restarunts like LAVO in NYC the managers have come over, apologized profusely and offered to buy a round of drinks, etc; however, I guess this establishment thinks they are too good for that.

We ordered some coffee- which we would have expected to be much stronger, it wasn't. Anyway, while eating my sister discovered a small piece of plastic in her lemon ricotta pancakes -- not a big deal, I've been in the industry for 7 years... unfortunately it happens - I just did not expect it to happen here. Overall though the food was delicious, we started out with the steak tartara which was really great. Everyone truly enjoyed their entree's as well - they portions were decently sized, everything was fresh, hot and extremely tasty. The service throughout the entire meal was on point, our server was very attentive and truly did whatever he could to meet our needs and make sure that we had an enjoyable brunch. After he could tell we were a bit disgruntled, he sent Dolores over to check on us. Her hospitality could not have been better, not only was she concerned but her concern was genuine. Brunch ended up being on the house and we were given one of every dessert. Of course you can throw free things at people at make them happy, but what really made us happy was her overall concern and desire to make sure that we walked out of her restaurant having a positive experience and wanting to come back.

Given the price of apps, it was just disappointing. For entrees, my table had the ravioli, another pasta with sunday gravy, and the pork chop. The pork looked amazing, but was underseasoned and just slightly overcooked - a shame for such a lovely piece of meat to be rendered dry. The potatoes it was served with could have been any bland, mashed vegetable. The pastas were both fine, but nothing that blew our minds. For dessert we had the deconstructed tiramisu and the sorbets.

Two of us went on a weekday for lunch and there was a wait; so I'd suggest making a reservation. We shared brussels sprouts, spaghetti squash, and burratta salad. Each I would recommend.

The spaghetti squash is another must try! The flavors were so rich, and was rather creamy! The burratta was served with frisee and heirloom tomatoes and almost seemed to have a slight pickled, sweet vinaigrette just lightly drizzled on top. They were very accommodating to allergies as well. The bread served with the meal further exemplified their attention to detail - it was a very thin focaccia with sliced cauliflower on top, so different. The ambiance suited the restaurant because although it was a large space it was inviting and on the minimal end, not too oranate - keeping the attention on the cuisine. Felt very European inspired. The portions were perfect for what we were looking, just enough to sample and share. Though these would be great starters or sides to dishes as well.

Â Dinner on a Saturday night, place was packed & loud, which I tend to like, preferring a party atmosphere to a hushed temple of gastronomy any day. Â The good (or I should say, the incredibly awesome): Â before dinner we were brought bread which consisted of the most delicious, sinful focaccia I've every had in my life. Â I would go back just for that alone. Â Seriously. Â The lamb meatballs were delicious, the fried artichokes were excellent. Â The wine list was really good, but predictably pricey. Â The steak tartare was excellent quality & quite tasty, but not particularly noteworthy or special compared to others I've had. Â The lemon tart w/lemon granita was very, very tart, so if you like lemon desserts, this would please you. Â The carrot cake was non-traditional & my companions weren't into it but I SO was. Â Instead of the usual moist carrot cake topped w/cream cheese frosting, this version had no frosting and was actually on the dry side, kinda sorta more like a coffee cake (for lack of a better description). Â I actually loved it because I'm not a sugar person & prefer desserts that skew toward less sweet. Â The bad: Â The waiter informed us that they will only take the full order at once. Â In other words, no ordering drinks & apps & lingering while deciding on a main course. Â The kitchen wants to control the pace, which I loathe. Â And finally, something very strange. Â Both my and a friend's pasta dishes were incredibly salty. Â I love salty foods, I cook w/lots of salt, and I like highly seasoned food. Â My dish was very tasty, but I couldn't finish it. Â This was literally a first in my life, not finishing a pasta dish, because I love pasta so much. Â Bottom line, do your research in advance in order to secure the best wine & the best price and don't count on LV to change their ""ordering everything at once"" policy anytime soon. Â My strategy for a successful return is to find out when I can get my hands on some of that focaccia & that's when I'll be back, even if it's just for breakfast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/locanda-verde-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
