Was finally able to come back here after many years of the pandemic. Some major changes include actual waiters as this used to be a seat yourself after you order place and hooks on the side and under the tables to put your bags and coats. We came here in a group of 3 at 1:30pm on a Saturday and it only took us 5 min to get seated. I got my usual Karaage with shio ramen and they taste as good as it used to be. I love the salt and dipping sauce they have for the Karaage. The main thing I love about this place is the chili. If you like spice, I recommend ordering the ramen you like (I've tried their chili ramen but still love their shio more) and asking for the chili paste (not really paste, more like crunchy chili bits).

I came at 6:30pm on a Saturday and luckily only had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 2. It is a very small place that seems more appropriate for take-out. However, I think ramen tastes a lot better when served at a restaurant, so we decided to eat there! I ordered the Shoyu ramen with tofu instead of beef. The ramen broth and noodles didn't have much flavor, but I did appreciate that it wasn't overly salted. It came with 2 pieces of sweet, thinly sliced tofu skin. I enjoyed the tofu skin (although it did verge on being too sweet) and wish it came with more! The marinated ramen egg is always my favorite part and was well-done here too. On the other hand, while I normally love bamboo in ramen, I thought their bamboo tasted off.

The shio ramen hit the spot. Loved the egg and green onions. The cha siu pork was a bit rough and would've made the the ramen bowl 10/10 if only the pork were more tender.

I came in on a Thursday evening to an empty restaurant. I ordered the Shio ramen which was insanely salty... I usually am not picky about ramen and think most ramens taste good-not-great but this one did not make the mark... sorry! The pork was somewhat tender but not juicy whatsoever.

The ramen was ok but it was very hot and also a good portion. So the reason I say the ramen is ok; I did not think the broth was flavorful and I did not like the bean sprouts. I think it needed more flavor; I added spice and it was good but I would definitely say it was not the star of my lunch. What I would say was great were the dumplings and service. I would definitely go back and I would try their other items I liked that the food was fresh and very hot; I love my food hot.

Amy L.,/user_details?userid=ai6Sb1iGQqJNh0w_Zo49Rg,"Toronto, Canada",7/17/2021,4.0,Stopped by Kuu for a hot bowl of ramen on a rainy NYC weekend. The place is pretty small inside but there wasn't a wait around 5PM. We tried the Tonkatsu Shio and Shoyu ramen and they were both quite good. The portion size is probably a bit bigger than your usual bowl of ramen and it even came with half an egg so value was definitely there! The broth was quite rich and creamy while the noodles were nice and chewy. I prefer a firmer noodle because the noodles did soak up some of the soup and it got a little soggy after a while. The pork belly was thick and tender with good flavor.

I got the Kuu Chili ramen without pork, extra ground chicken (I don't eat pork) and it satisfied my craving. There are definitely places that have a more rich broth but they can be out of the way for me if I'm feeling lazy and don't want to go uptown. The servers are all very friendly and they get to you as quick as they can. This is an excellent place for dining solo as they have some seating against the wall. It's about average ramen prices as well.

However, once I dug deeper I found a few too many offenses - the egg was hard boiled rather than soft, the arugula made every bite bitter and clashed with the savory flavors of the ramen, the pork was cut very thick, making it lack the melt-in-your-mouth effect I look forward to in ramen dishes, and I found a clump of unseparated noodles in the bowl.

Allison S.,/user_details?userid=7QwGH5-tZnIcKTszO8ZHqA,"Manhattan, NY",12/9/2019,5.0,"WOW. The spicy pork ramen was a VERY close second to Ichiran, which is in my opinion serving up ramen royalty. Kuu was so good. Very humble atmosphere. Communal tables and spots against the wall if you're slurping alone. And you can slurp all damn day if you want. The vibe and the music is loud enough that no one will hear you. This spot is also across the street from Fulton, which (as you New Yorkers know) has every train a person could need.

Food was hot and delicious, the waiter gave us great recommendations and there was very speedy service. If you come after the restaurant is full there is typically a 20-30min wait.

Sy L.,/user_details?userid=emmYFthwbKAl2qt3l4sJLA,"Bethlehem, PA",8/5/2017,2.0,I had chili ramen - which tastes like plain chili oil and has nothing really worth mentioning. 13 dollars was also too much considering the quality.

This place is no Ramen Lab, Ippudo, Totto, or any of the other famous ramen shops in the city. But for a lunch spot in FiDi, this place really isn't so bad (especially compared to the other mediocre lunch spots in the area). I ordered the chili ramen, which had a very spicy soup, though nothing out of the ordinary. I wouldn't recommend finishing the soup unless you really don't mind drinking salty water. The pork belly was very tasty, though there were only 2 small pieces. The noodles themselves were average and reminded me of the instant-noodle-ramen type of noodles. All in all, it was a filling and quick meal.

We were near the WTC and wanted to eat something nearby. The place is tiny and it's in an alley way. There was a wait time when we entered the restaurant. People have to sit next to other customers which is normal in a ramen place. We do like how they gave our food pretty quickly. The Japanese chicken and the sauce that came with it were delicious! The chicken was juicy and the sauce matched it so well. I wanted to try their special so I had the Kuu Chili which was pretty spicy. The broth, noodles, and chashu were all good. They weren't super oily and we liked that. The broth for the tonkotsu was also good. We were surprised about the thickness of their chashu because usually the ones we've been to in CA had thinner ones, but we did like the juiciness of their chashu. The ramen helped in warming us because it was so cold when we went here. Their service was good and they always came to check if we had enough water.

Meh.  The soup was good and smooth... With not too overpowering flavors but that's probably the only memorable factor.  I slurped that soup all up.  The noodles was OK. There were way too many beans sprouts.   I was also super upset that there was no egg in my order.. Cry cry cry. What is thisssss????

Ordered the kuu chili chili ramen but I substituted the chicken for pork. It was packed with flavor and it was just the right amount of spicy. Also had the miso eggplant. Ive had it at other restaurants but I wasn't a fan of it from Kuu Ramen. There was a lack of flavor and the eggplant skin needed to be cooked more. It kept getting stuck on my teeth which is just not attractive. We tried to order the shishito peppers but was told they no longer make that item, which was pretty disappointing.

I don't love to dine in, as it's really small and literally one block away from my own apartment, but when I have, service is quick. That said, the fact that I can take ramen to go and it's my favorite in the city has to say something. Quality surely doesn't suffer because I'm taking it out of the restaurant. The miso beef is top notch - rich broth, perfectly cooked noodles, shredded beef...heavenly. We've tried the miso pork and others, but the shredded beef in the Miso Beef is by far my favorite. The sushi here too is surprisingly delicious - fresh fish, healthy portions and a great appetizer to the ramen. I can't recommend this place enough. My only qualm - we need frequent buyer cards!

I also requested no butter and bean sprouts and just extra corn instead and was told extremely rudely those two things are cheaper than corn so cannot add corn. Isn't a repeat customer worth more?

Michelle Y.,/user_details?userid=eIFoFZZLuOq-Xi1ckhcflg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4/24/2017,4.0,This place is one of the lesser known Ramen places in the city but I am definitely glad I gave it a go. I went on a Tuesday evening at around 7 pm and it was a 20 minute wait which I didn't mind because it is located in the Financial district so there were probably a lot of people wanting ramen for dinner after work. I was seated by the window and noticed that there is a coat hanger located near the door which was a nice touch. The place is pretty small so you don't have a ton of room but it's still a cute little place that I would eat at again. I ordered the Kuu Chili Ramen ($14) with corn ($1) that was very delicious. The ramen comes with both pork and ground chicken and the broth is flavorful but not too spicy. I also ordered the pork bao but I was definitely underwhelmed. The piece of pork was a bit small and not as juicy as I am used to. I thought with my seating that the service would be slow because we are not as conspicuous as everyone else but our waitress still came frequently to refill our water and clear our plates.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kuu-ramen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I Tried this Ramen place during my visit to New York.  Extremely disappointed. No where near as good as the Ramen I get in Los Angeles. Which is weird because the cooks are Mexicans in both restaurants. Anyways I ordered the Miso Pork Ramen. It tasted like it passed thru the colon of the pig before it was served to me. I'm tempted to say there was an earthy flavor but that would be implying the flavor was enjoyable on some level. NO. It either tasted like corn or dirt/pig feces. Not that I ever tried pig feces. They have 1 spicy miso ramen option but in the menu it says they only serve 10 bowls a day. Didn't even ask to see if it was available. I asked if they could make the Miso Pork spicy and they said they have chili options I can add myself on the side. Which consisted of a chili powder and a thing that was red and chunky. I added both and it did nothing to add spiciness to the dish. Again the hand roll was a 9 out of 10. The ramen was a 3 out of 10.

Nick C.,/user_details?userid=PPTV5ry-LXvA1lEQMosdow,"Manhattan, NY",1/11/2023,5.0,"It had been on the list to try since I had seen it was going to be opening. It is a pleasant little place, not too large, a square-longish space that extends back. I had been to the two previous incarnations prior to Steak Frites and for whatever reason, they did no work out. I was seated when I arrived. I was given the option of sitting at the bar since I was alone but preferred a table. It was just after 5p when they open, so tables were available. I was given a food and drink menu and began to look them over but I knew what I wanted. Water arrived at the table and shortly after, bread with whipped butter in a small vat. I opted to hold off on the bread until after I had my hanger steak which I subsequently ordered. This came with herb butter but there were also several other sauces you could get if you desired. The steak came with shoestring potatoes and some greens. The hanger steak arrived medium rare and was delicious. The fries came with a small vat of ketchup and mayo. The bread, which I saved for the end was great as well, fresh with two large chunks to feast on. The space is clean, well organized. The restrooms are towards the back and down the stairs. Juan was my server and was attentive and accommodating. It is slightly more expensive than other restaurants in the area but this was a steak meal so that is to be expected. I would recommend highly and will return.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/steak-frites-bistro-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The host/'manager refused to seat us till the whole party arrived though the restaurant was entirely empty, though in fairness some of the party was running very late. The food and service was mostly very good except for trying to convince us that Blue Moon beers were Pilsners and severely overcooking one of the steaks to the point of almost inedibility. The restaurant had a bad smell though like an open/blocked drain. Lastly I checked my receipt and noticed it didn't match with the tip I left.

Was excited to try the food. Got the curry chicken katsu and the spaghetti roe. The curry was very light not that flavorful. The breading for the chicken was good. Portions are a bit small. The sesame toast was very plain. The toast itself only outside was slightly crispy. Only looks cute but not that good. The matcha with the coffee jelly was mediocre. I've had better matcha latte at a lot of other places. The spaghetti first bite was very good. But after more than one bite. It's a little salty. Not surprised since it has roe in it. The best part was the first bite of the spaghetti. Everything else was disappointing.

As for the toasts, it might just be me but I don't think cream cheese and sesame go very well together :/ Nothing too special to say about it.

I rolled up just after it opened and the counter was almost full with patrons already! I was seated right away and I ordered the berry jam and cream cheese toast with a matcha yuzu honey lemonade. My drink came out first and it was lovely! It was refreshing and had a great matcha flavor but was also sweet and tart from the honey and citrus. I loved it! And because i was sitting at the counter, I was able to watch how they made my toast! It was literally watching art be made. The bread was thick and fluffy and the strawberry jam and cream cheese combination made for a delicious combo. My neighbor to the right had ordered the adorable cinnamon butter toast and my neighbor to the left had ordered the mentai mayo and those were really pretty works of art as well.

The sauce is so flavorful, we were savoring every last bite. We also ordered the chicken katsu curry and it was surprisingly better than we expected. The curry has a tiny kick to it that made it so delicious. Of course, we ordered the black sesame and cream cheese toast. Aesthetic and flavor combination are both a 5/5. I was inspired to make my own matcha cream cheese toast at home afterwards. As for drinks, we got the matcha au lait with coffee jelly and black sesame latte. I liked how both of them were lightly sweetened and though I've had better black sesame lattes before, I still enjoyed this one.

Thanks to Tik Tok I found Davelle and knew I had to put it on our list of brunch spots. We went on a Saturday afternoon and only had to wait 15 minutes, not bad for a weekend! The restaurant is pretty small but really cute! We were sat at an awkward spot which looked like a refurnished fireplace top. It was just us two so we didn't need much space, but it would have been nice to have one of the tables. We ordered the milky ruby, honey lemon toast, cinnamon butter toast, and the napolitan spaghetti (which I heard was no longer on the menu!!). The milky ruby was super light, refreshing, and sweet! Could not taste the alcohol at all, which in my opinion makes a good drink. The honey lemon toast and cinnamon butter toast were good as well! I usually don't like lemon flavor, but I thoroughly enjoyed it! The cinnamon butter is super simple and classic. As for the napolitan spaghetti, it was excellent! I had forgotten all the ingredients but I know it was one of our favorites! I am sad to hear they no longer sell it! Although Davelle's items are not overly complex, their food design and atmosphere makes this place so unique and classic.

The chicken also wasn't that crispy. The sesame latte tasted like an instant sesame soup packet from the Chinese supermarket. Service is horrible too. There was a bar in the side with two seats and there were 3 people in my party. They wouldn't let us all squeeze in that bar with an extra chair because ""it gets too crowded"" but we said we didn't mind but they still wouldn't let us. Not a smart business move, they could have lost a lot of money bcuz we spent like $80 here. We stayed and had to wait another 30 minutes for a table. I would not come back here bcuz there is much better food in nyc.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/davelle-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friends and I got the Berry and Cream Cheese Toast, Chicken Katsu Curry, Uni Spaghetti, and Iced coffee with Coffee Jelly. I thought the toast was yummy but realistically not worth the price; would only recommend getting if you care about getting an aesthetic Insta pic. The curry and spaghetti were divine but gone in 5 bites :( However, I guess these serving sizes/prices are typical of a nice niche cafe in NYC. Be prepared for long waiting times due to the cafe's limited seating and no reservation policy.

Jenny T.,/user_details?userid=RXUkiMpHM4vmdCI-_aOEiA,"Castro Valley, CA",6/3/2022,4.0,"Hole in the wall, Japanese cafe serving mostly toast, curries, and speciality drinks. Have not tried the toast but they do seem to take quite an effort to make aesthetic wise. As a solo diner, I was seated at the bar counter. Seat was a little uncomfortable, hard to sit up on. Ordered a black sesame kinako latte. Was hoping to have latte art as I've seen on other pictures but sadly didn't get one. It was super foamy on top. Taste wise it was pretty good. A less sweeter version of the Chinese black sesame pudding mix. Which I actually love so the drink was a nice surprise. I did see them add the kinako powder in my drink but couldn't taste it. The black sesame is pretty strong taste wise. Near the end of my drink, you can taste the leftover gritty powder. Got quite busy inside, there was only one person serving and hosting customers. He seemed a little overwhelmed. I saw customers coming in and wanting to dine in but it was a full house. Some girls next to me already finished eating and looked like they ready to pay but they didn't call out to the guy and just kept talking. I think they can work on clearing out the place more efficiently if they had another person helping him.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/davelle-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Perhaps the limited space keeps the dinner menu small as well, and one hopes that each dish benefits from the chef's extra attention. My first choices here were solid, but not mind-blowing. The crisp exteriors of the cheese potato croquettes are accompanied by moist interiors. Perhaps too moist in fact, and the cheese flavor is hard to detect. Although a staple dish, the chicken katsu curry arrives with a thoughtful presentation. Again the fry is well done, and the chicken skin adheres well to the meat beneath. Thus it's easy to cut tiny bites with the edge of a spoon (a pet peeve of mine). The first impression of the curry sauce is sweetness, but this is followed by a complex and lingering aftertaste.

I came here shortly after reading Ligaya Mishan's review on NYT. I wanted to have breakfast but came during lunch instead so I had the sea urchin pasta which was one of the most simple yet indulgent dishes I've had in a long time.

Look here, you can make your own by buying a pack of frozen fish paste blocks and heating them over the stove but the secret is in the soup, without the right ingredients then you'd be left with semi-decent oden with passable but definitely not stellar quality soup to match the mediocre oden. What Davelle serves up is oden that can make your knees weak, smile ear to ear, and close your eyes while taking in that sweet aroma that dances up to your nostrils while sitting in their quaint low-key restaurant.

The cafe itself is very cozy with limited seating; even though I went when they first opened on a weekday, the place was quickly filled up with people. For party of two, we ordered the mentai mayo toast, berry and cream cheese toast, and a loco moco bowl. The flavor for every dish is very unique and enjoyable, however, the portion size of each dish is honestly on the lighter/smaller end especially considering how much each costs. It was my first time trying mentai toast and I really enjoyed parts of the toast with mentai, but rest of the toast was almost tasteless (would prefer more mayo)! The berry and cream cheese toast had generous amount of housemade jam and cream cheese on it so no complaint there, very sweet and creamy. The loco moco bowl was on the sweeter side for the burger & sauce, but that is not a problem for me personally since I love everything sweet~ the meatloaf burger was tender and juicy, the rice was flavorful, and the bowl tasted really hearty.

Rena S.,/user_details?userid=gG3kYDH-DHkVYRiHojSKHA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/26/2018,5.0,"It's a newly opened Japanese style cafe in LES and I have already been there a couple of times! It's just lovely with a unique menu that has a sense of a classic cafe (kissaten) in Japan!!! Signature dishes for dinner are apparently oden, which ingredients ranging from vegetables to sausage and veggie tofu nuggets (ganmo) are simmered in a Japanese broth. ""Davelle"" comes from a word to describe ""chill"" in Japanese and as the name of this place shows this is certainly a place that you want to come to relax with delicious foods. As Japanese classic cafe always do, they are particular about quality coffee, and they have a special drip coffee machine from Japan and that's something that you want to try. Also, my favorite dessert is a coffee jelly, which comes with a syrup made of milk and this is the only place that you have that tasty coffee jelly in the city. They are open from early morning to late night and whenever you stop by you can have a quality time there.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/davelle-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My party of 3 was seated at the bar, which seemed like it would be a pretty tight fit but there was actually plenty of room. We ordered the 10 oden set, fried chicken, spaghetti, and potato salad. I think my favorite was the tomato in the oden set. It was such an interesting flavor and texture that I've never tried anywhere else before. The spaghetti was amazing as well-the waiter advised us to break the egg up and mix it with the noodles to get the full flavor, and it boosted the flavors so much more! Even the potato salad, which I imagined would be very simple, was delicious and so interestingly presented. For so much food, the bill was very modest at the end. This is also a Japanese-style no-tip establishment, and the waiter said the best tip for them would be for us to come back. Overall, definitely will go back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/davelle-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I wanted to try to pork curry dish but they did not tell me it was sold out until I had ordered it and finished my 2 appetizers. Only then they told me it was sold out and asked me to pick something else, I almost just wanted to say no thanks and leave but I didn't​ want to be rude. I ordered the Napoleons spaghetti instead, it was not tasty​ at all. It was cold, and it seems like they tossed it with generic ketchup, literally, and for $22?! Cray.
