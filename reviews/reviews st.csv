I opted for the bird's nest since the bartender said it tastes the least like alcohol compared to everything else on the whole menu lol. It was pretty good and very sweet, not one of the best drinks I've had but in general I liked how creative the drink menu was! Especially as a Chinese American recognizing a bunch of cultural references in the drink names, and the unique Chinese ingredients that are mixed into the drinks. In terms of food, I liked the truffle mushroom salad the most bc the flavors were on point. Pork belly was okay to me, I felt like the portions were way too small and could have been more tender. Crab fried rice was solid though!"

Vaishnavi N.,/user_details?userid=91OSldGDuZzW1YdwrTM6Ag,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",3/24/2023,3,"The place is so nicely done. We went on the weekend for lunch and did not have to wait, although we did not have a reservation. Service was quick. We got the spanakopita and it was great. Apart from that rest of the food we had was just okay. Briam was sautéed vegetables and it was pretty bland and even their fava dip. But sure if it's a good spot for vegetarians."

I was a bit disappointed that they ran out of grilled octopus and the chicken souvlaki skewers which can apparently only be ordered at their sister restaurant (the main reason why I wanted to come here). I ended up getting the lamp chops, saganaki, dakos salad, and the shrimp. Everything was super flavorful. Also loved the restaurant vibe - it was quirky and quaint without coming across pompous."
Julia M.,/user_details?userid=5fStgj0OLMIk-9KO0MatRA,"New York, NY",9/6/2022,4,"Really cool spot! The eggplant dip was amazing. The lamb was delicious but there were a ton of fries and the rest of the meat on the platter wasn't quite as good. All in all, cool place for a date or friends night out!"

There's lot of tables inside and it's a pretty big place but it does get packed. I went for dinner and got the tzatziki, octopus, lamb chops, moussaka, and finished off with their cheesecake. Everything was soo good. Tzatziki with the pita bread was good and flavorful. Octopus was tender. Lamb chops were amazing and came with fries. Moussaka had eggplant and meat and very very filling. Also goes well with a glass of wine. And definitely get the cheesecake!! The crust was amazing. Will definitely be back for more!"

Hannah J.,/user_details?userid=v7yaJzY6E8h-zRbWXvbXtg,"Brooklyn, NY",5/2/2022,5,Kiki's is a special spot in the city. Love this gem and the food. I didn't get any pictures of the food because we absolutely devoured it but it is sooo tasty. It can be hard to get in but it seems to be a favorite of large groups. They have both sides of the street and the restaurant is unmarked other than the copious amounts of people spilling out onto the sidewalk and their doors being wide open for a glimpse inside. The tzatziki is to die for and the pita is so soft. I had the chicken with potatoes and the sauce really made the meal. The chicken also wasn't too dry. Inside there is a lot of energy and rustic decor.
Kelly M.,/user_details?userid=Fb2i-Si7XwqSElcAY1L2hg,"New York, NY",3/16/2023,5,"If you're expecting food here that will blow you out of the water, this is not the place.

Astoria has some of the best I find but this place hands down is a vibe. It's the environment, the energy, the people and of course the star of everything - the food. I always order the octopus. It has changed over the years but I still like the char finish. Spanakopita apps, lamb chop (must order medium closer to rare) and the fries are bomb! Only downside is no reservations due to how popular it is and the long wait when it's busy times."
Gabby G.,/user_details?userid=PpPL_m6hJzIeHELRZOrz7w,"Brooklyn, NY",1/12/2022,4,"Lovely ambiance and quality mediterranean food at a reasonable price! Called before arrival and employee was able to answer all my questions. Ordered 4 items and shared them all with a friend. The tzatziki was rich, perfectly seasoned and came with a bowl of bread. When we ran out, our server kindly brought out a second serving. We also ordered the sautéed shrimp in a cream that was delicious and garlicky in addition to the zucchini chips and greek salad. I was impressed by the service and freshness of the ingredients. It is BYOB but cork service is $25 which is more than I was willing to pay."

Brooke H.,/user_details?userid=V7oqfobbyIJaFarL_sPz1Q,"New York, NY",9/7/2022,5,YUM! I love Kiki's. Definitely one of my staples in the city. I've been a few times and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I think my favorite dish is the Spanakopita. And you absolutely can't forget finishing off your meal with some cheesecake. Cannot recommend enough!
Marquis B.,/user_details?userid=vSlmGj8hFlatn0Klh3Sqlw,"Brooklyn, NY",12/14/2021,5,"I knew Kiki's was going to be good but not GOOD! Wow, was I surprised? Absolutely!  Every dish was a knockout. I ordered Zucchini Chips, Maroulosalata, Fava, Sautéed Shrimp, and Bread & Pita. My favorite dish was the Maroulosalata, which was a Mediterranean salad. The vegetables and feta tasted incredibly fresh. The fava, which was similar to hummus in its consistency, was delicious and creamy. The zucchini chips were fried and crisped to perfection, making it a perfect side dish that was difficult to stop eating. The shelled Sautéed Shrimp was well seasoned in a tasty creamy sauce. My only negative critique was that staff did not ask to see my proof of vaccination, which I volunteered and showed staff. The restaurant had ample indoor and outdoor dining. It's a very clean restaurant and is located in a hip neighborhood."

He seated us quickly and took our order with a charming smile. We ordered sautéed shrimp, grilled octopus, fava beans, lamp chops (come with fries), and spaghetti (mixed creme and tomato sauce). The cold fava bean smear was creamy and reminiscent of a chick pea texture, served with tomatoes, onions and capers. Lamb chops were juicy, succulent & tender. The fries and sauce were perfectly oily and flavorful. We loved the octopus. The sautéed shrimp were in an exquisite creme sauce. Seating outside felt European and perfect on a cool early summer night. The cheese cake was airy and not too heavy. Three of us shared it and it was delicious."
Courtney W.,/user_details?userid=9dSAShC-S40rbHx_SKJP0w,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12/6/2022,4,Delicious. Food was light and perfect for afternoon lunch. Was crowded inside but sitting weather was nice enough to enjoy outside seating.

It gets packed so I usually come early or late ( they are open for food until midnight-many places post pandemic close by 10pm) . food comes out fast and the food is well priced ! It's almost like Greek tapas- its nice to order a bunch of things and share with friends. Octopus , shrimp , bifteki and all dips are my favorite.  The cheese with honey is good but heavy. Lamb is hit or miss here I would probably avoid ordering it as I've had really good and bad experiences. They used to have more beers and wine from Greece- selection is a bit less. Would like to see them bring that back - like the red donkey. Who wants to go to a Greek place and order a goose island IPA????"

It's a little hole in the wall with such character but so worth the visit. I do suggest getting here as soon as they open because they don't take the reservations and the wait can fill up quickly. To start we ordered the tzatziki, , taramosalata and Greek Salad. All the dips came with pita and bread and everything was so delicious! The eggplant dip was probably my favorite thing I had here it is so good I definitely recommend ordering! To continue, we had spanakopita, grilled octopus and bifteki, everything was delicious. The spanakopita was beautifully crispy and filled with amazing flavors, grilled octopus was prepared perfectly and the bifteki was AMAZING, cooked to perfection and filled with flavor! When here I definitely recommend not missing out on the bifteki, spanakopita and the melitzanosalata (eggplant). This place is a staple of LES do not miss out on coming here!"

Highly recommend the chicken and lemon potatoes.
Hannah S.,/user_details?userid=ExvxqlbzSlSKJoIv6aCogA,"Upper East Side, New York, NY",1/18/2023,5,This restaurant is a classic for a reason and the food and ambiance are great. Perfect spot for a group of friends to go to share and all leave happy and full!
Cathy O.,/user_details?userid=jsQrtbl5y4F68dD1AyQ6-A,"Miami, FL",9/3/2021,4,"We were inbetween happy hour and a BYOB comedy show, so not 100% hungry nor thirsty. After checking to be sure we could leave with unfinished wine, we ordered a bottle of Oenodea and each had a glass. We also ordered the grilled octopus, palates me avga, and the moussaka (as they were out of the lamb frikasse.) the octopus was super tasty and tender, the fries opted with oregano, feta cheese and an egg, and the moussaka was huge. Since we'd already devoured some happy hour treats, we actually took a doggie bag home, and the rest of the wine went on to our next stop. Luckily we were seated near a fan. My taste buds were happy but my only complaint was that there was no air conditioning."

We got there on a super cold night and the line was out the door. We opted for outdoor seating, but none of the tables had heat lamps or covers so we had to brave the winds. The waiters weren't super attentive and the food was cold as soon as it got to our table. The only thing going for them was their wine deal (you can get a liter of wine for a very low price). Hopefully I can come back and have a better experience here."

Summer M.,/user_details?userid=0fITyhIRwC7Gv4fSycjAjQ,"New York, NY",9/2/2022,2,The food quality went down. I ordered lamb chops and octopus- poor preparation and flavor. Seems like while rushing to make more money by expending they sacrificed quality.
Adam F.,/user_details?userid=59zS9i8NmVTmD3SW1wTHoA,"Near North Side, Chicago, IL",8/27/2022,2,"The food was AMAZING, but the host was rude and on some sort of unnecessary power trip.  Bad day, maybe, but I'll avoid the place if they're working again."

But it was totally worth the wait! We ended up getting a ton of small plates for the table and everything was absolutely delicious. Only reason not giving this a 5 star is because we got put at a table in the corner and the staff seemed to forget about us at some point, had to remind them about our orders but I'm assuming it was simply because of how busy they were. Otherwise it was splendid for dinner"

Great for large groups as well due to the prices and theres something on the menu for everyone. Do get the house wine its a great deal! The lemon potatoes, and spanakopita are also a must! Then from there pick which meat you desire. Can't go wrong with the lamb frikasse, tender and so juicy. Falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth. Paired nicely with the imam baildi vegetable medley especially on a brisk spring night. Everything was hot, came out fast and with a smile (behind the mask lol). Reallly good stuff! So many people agree that they expanded to another location right across the street!"
Michael T.,/user_details?userid=2gcJ0RxWNfSKUPkeB-Y99A,"New York, NY",4/17/2021,5,"I was in the LES neighborhood and my friend and I stopped here for brunch. We ended up inside (which had limited capacity and many open windows and was fine COVID-wise). The food was excellent! I just loved the Greek egg toast - especially the salad they chopped up. I wish I could make that myself. The zucchini chips were also delish. Wait staff were good but it's the food I'll come back for. Thanks, chef!"
Havah B.,/user_details?userid=91b9AgLa1d-kvkFpWh_KOQ,"Manhattan, PRINCE, NY",10/10/2021,5,"This place is quite hidden, so I was lucky to hear about it from a friend. I shared 1L of house red and the sampler meat platter for three with two other friends, and we were absolutely stuffed by the end of our meal. Our waitress was incredibly welcoming and helpful. If you're looking for a cozy Mediterranean atmosphere -- and a lot of meat -- try out this place!"
Matthew H.,/user_details?userid=ytZRAbsYyWOkew6gmpMaGQ,"New York, NY",6/23/2021,4,"Overall I loved the food here. Service was OK, not amazing but friendly enough. Definitely try some of the natural wines on offer. My favorite dishes were the spinach pie (spanokopita) and the zucchini chips by far!"

deirdre s.,/user_details?userid=xpWJN0LpgPcWRjdh8FjroQ,"New York, NY",10/22/2021,5,I am Greek so I know the real deal. This place serves food that tastes like Yia Yia's and it is reasonably priced. The Greek lager was a real treat too. This is the perfect place to share small and large plates.

Nicole C.,/user_details?userid=1OzD3b96Cpi55haIrR4D4A,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/13/2022,2,"All the food we were served was luke warm at best.  Given the tepidity of the food, nothing could be beyond bland. The lamb chop were dry, even though we asked for medium rare. The octopus was cold. The moussaka I think could have been good had it not come room temperature. Everything was just underwhelming."
Pett O.,/user_details?userid=v28DibiRxvd4sUuzm38YSw,"Manhattan, NY",10/23/2021,4,"The service is extraordinary. And the space is really beautiful, and warm and nice at any time of the day. The menu has a clear concept: Greek classics modernized, but not in a sophisticated way, just making them a bit lighter. The octopus is great, and nothing is below the category of ""delicious"". Only thing, is that it could go further in creativity."
Lindsey D.,/user_details?userid=eGy5lq1qBTljIsdWhDeYzg,"New York, NY",5/28/2021,4,"This is the best Greek food we have had in NYC! Kiki's is a cozy restaurant with 3 bars now! 2 in the one restaurant, 1 across the street. From outside, there is no sign that says ""Kiki's."" We got a liter of house wine for $26 and had incredible food. For appetizers, we got the tzatziki which was perfect & came with pita and cucumbers (which we requested). We also got the Greek salad (horiatiki) which was fresh & delicious. We also enjoyed the octopus. The patates me agave were delicious and the eggs were perfectly cooked (not too runny). The honey mustard sauce with the fries was fabulous. For dinner, we have ordered the moussaka (eggplant, potatoes, & meat) & the lamb (amazing). There are not gluten free denotations on the menu but the waitress was helpful with navigating the menu. The waitress said that they use the same grill with bread so this restaurant is definitely not for those that are very sensitive to gluten."

Maggie Z.,/user_details?userid=2-uP_Db0SeV721CBYdoZ3g,"Chicago, IL",11/19/2022,2,"The food was pretty bland and unseasoned. The grilled octopus was good in that it was tender, but we couldn't taste any other seasoning, only the lemon juice from what we squeezed. The portion of the octopus was also smaller than what was seen in the pictures, so I guess that's inflation for ya. We also ordered the pastichio plate and branzino. I didn't expect the pastichio to be sweet, and it tasted more like it was an apple pie, considering the cinnamon and brown sugar taste. The branzino was the highlight of the meal, but was still on the bland side. This dish came with a side of potatoes or rice, and we opted for the rice. This rice seemed to only rely on the sauce for flavoring, because it straight up tasted like tomato sauce. Additionally the service was flat out bad. The server never came up to us to ask how the food was, never asked if we needed anything else, and never came to refill our water. We were able to wave him down at the end, and even then he only asked if we were done and if he could take the plates away. This place is not worth the hype."

I was thoroughly disappointed, however, that I found a hair in my lamb chops. The manager offered me a dessert to make up for it which I personally did not eat and when I asked that my meal be taken off the check the response was "" well everyone has hair "" and "" you found it at the end of the meal. "" Meanwhile I had the hair in my hand when I told them, it didn't match the color or texture of anyone sitting at my table, and stopped eating once I found it. I've never had a restaurant push back on a sanitary issue with a meal and was frankly taken aback."

The saganaki, greek salad & zucchini chips were all amazing shareable plates! The moussaka was delicious as well but super rich so we couldn't finish. Definitely tasted homemade! Okay also the vibes were super chill and the servers were so sweet. Absolutely felt at home here. Come here for date night, come with your friends!"

I was excited to try a Greek restaurant in the city and in fact I was the one who chose to try this place. The salad was coming out but I decided to cancel it as everyone at my table was almost finished eating.  Nit only that, the waiter made us wait forever for our check and we needed to ask for a to go box twice. Very poor service."

I loved the rustic feel of the restaurant, the openness of the seating arrangements, and the kind demeanor of the people that work there. I had the sort of puree(d) feta with red peppers; l know it has a name, but I like to call it spicy feta. I also ordered the lamb fricassee...it was good. warm. comforting. felt like a home-cooked meal. also felt like I was eating on the set of GoT (lol). My friend and I also split a bottle of wine. It was delicious and wasn't costly. I am more of a cocktail girl, but the bottle certainly did the job. will be returning."

They cant seem to decide if gyro's are available at both seating locations or not? How can you seat people at different sides and offer a different menu. We ordered gyro platters, were served kebabs, and then got sass from the waiter. Last time we were here the blonde haired waiter forgot one of our orders and my drink, also almost spilled tzatziki on my friend then didnt replace the spilled food!"

Both Very simple but delicious dishes and also incredibly specific and delicious dishes. I recommend the Spanakopita and if you're not that into Greek food, or you got kids, or newbies, Get the Saganaki or the patates me avga. The patates r these perfectly fried French fries with some feta, herbs, and fried egg on top and the saganaki is this fried/baked cheese pastry thing with lemon and honey and I literally ascended off the ground upon bite. So definitely bring like weights or a like a dense item/friend to hold u down and keep u grounded."

The prices are reasonable, portions big and the atmosphere is lively yet intimate with small tables and ideal for a date or catching up with friends. They don't accept reservation so depending on when you go you'll likely have to wait if it's not during an off time. I think it's one of the best Greek restaurants I've been to in Manhattan and I continue to include it as a recommendation for friends."

I would suggest making reservations this place is packed. It is a big space as well. The food is top notch and so is the service. The really loved the soup. The spinach pie is a huge piece and it was heavy and very filling. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for authentic Greek cuisine.

Vickie W.,/user_details?userid=v1wOhhRrjsQw6ppkkvk_Bg,"New York, NY",12/12/2020,5,"COVID-19 outdoor dining review: during the beginning of the pandemic, a friend and I got takeout from Kiki's (Greek salad, eggplant dip, and a side of fries) and ate everything with delight on a nearby bench. When they opened for outdoor dining this summer, I eagerly came back, and can report that this restaurant still knocks it out of the park. Getting a table both times I came for dinner was shockingly easy, even at prime time, as they have quite a few outdoor tables set up on the street. The setup feels very spacious, and they've been able to maintain the same cool but low-key vibe that made it so easy to while away hours here drinking their house wine and eating simple, excellent food. I've had most of the menu at this point, but faves are definitely the saganaki, moussaka, Greek salad, octopus, shrimp in the mustard-cider vinaigrette, avgolemono soup (pre-pandemic, I loved coming alone during the week and eating the soup + the octopus or shrimp with a book at the bar), roasted lemon potatoes, and my beloved cheesecake."
Jennifer D.,/user_details?userid=cdGoRtWVpVejF_-aEE30wA,"Manhattan, NY",11/20/2020,5,I eat here ALL THE TIME. Dinner never ever disappoints! The serving sizes are family style & we always have a hefty to-go bag after every meal. Kiki's leftovers the next day?! Yes! Service is great. They were very COVID friendly & all the tables were spaced out appropriately. I tell my friends about this place all the time!
Sarah D.,/user_details?userid=CWxTYc9RqDXCssBp5tXu8g,"Island Park, NY",2/23/2021,5,"Kiki's is the absolute best. The food is out of this world and the owner is a rockstar. The meat platter is my go too but honestly everything I've had from Kiki's has been wonderful. Also, make sure you save room for dessert, Nicko's cold cheesecake is a must have"
Kylie L.,/user_details?userid=wA7lSG7IYRM2l9yWP08Wrg,"San Diego, CA",10/25/2020,5,Outstanding experience. There's usually a long wait in the weekends but lots of fun bars around that area. The octopus was good the fries with mustard sauce was amazing. The honey and cheese hot appetizer was really good and different. I cannot wait to go back and try 10 other things.

There are so many better places in the city for Greek. This place was better for the atmosphere during normal times but now with Covid that part isn't there either.

I suggest putting your name down, getting a drink somewhere and coming back. We ordered grilled octopus, it was perfect didn't taste fishy. The Horiatiki salad, also good traditional dish. The waitress suggested the saganaki, I wouldn't have ordered this on my own but it's a must. I can't explain why it's so good but it just is, especially love the honey. My friends shared branzino, and I ordered the moussaka, which was good and super filling."

After that we ordered spinach pie and whole fish with lemon potato. Everything was really good. This is for 2 people and for dessert we got the baklava that was great as well. Total price U$80."

We had lots of wine, multiple apps, and about 4 lbs of meat. I'm not complaining! It was also very obviously a 'cool kids' spot - so I felt like a cool kid by proxy. I went with two old friends and this was the perfect place to catch up, have some belly laughs, and get increasingly meat sweaty. There is a new Greek Goddess in town and her name is Kiki."

My first experience here was an entirely positive one, and I couldn't stop thinking or talking about it afterward! Admittedly, I always think ""Queens"" whenever I crave good Greek food...well, maybe not anymore. The horiatiki (their Greek salad) is so fresh and perfect and the chicken with lemon potatoes really hit the spot. I also enjoyed the taramosalata, something I always order at Greek restaurants, and didn't have the same problem some other reviewers--bland and pale? Did we eat at the same place?--In any event, arrive early to avoid the wait that seems to be the root of so many people's disappointment in Kiki's. Come hungry and leave happy :) Perfect for an early dinner date."

Carafes of wine (1L) are ~$24! I highly recommend the saganaki if you like savory and sweet. The octopus is also great and lemony and so so tender. Also, tzaziki is crazy good and they bring charred breads/pita for dipping. Nice ambiance, like a dimly lit cavern in Europe. Will keep this place in my top places to bring visitors to impress!"

The zucchini fries are magic aNd soooo cheesy. Thinly sliced zucchin and then tempura  frIed?! To perfeCtion anD while theyy sits hot, I think small crumbly cheese is generously  sprinkled on. Lots of ggood cheese. I was able to scoop the cheese at the bottom of the basket. Loved it. Lemon potatoes have a creamy dressing. It's simple but you keep going to the potato wedge for another bitte. Red snapper gRilled was a tinY little bit over cooked but I still devoured every centimeter of this fish.

Tons of options for both meat eaters and vegetarians. Everything tastes great here but no matter what you get, you have to get a side of fries.

Tyler L.,/user_details?userid=KzKb7hRHw45AScttackzWg,"New York, NY",10/26/2017,4,"Small Greek place in Chinatown serving home cooking style food. One of the interesting characteristics of this place is that the sign on the awning is still in Chinese. Decor wise, it looks like an old cafe or tavern. I had the spanakopita (spinach pie) and moussaka here. Both were full of flavor and quite good. The moussaka was much better than I have had in other places. Other places had a moussaka that was dry and harder. This place had a very moist one, with egg in it that was very fluffy. The prices here are very reasonable too, and noticeably lower than Greek places you would find in Midtown."

Really authentic and fresh with LARGE plates. We ordered three items for each of us. We only really needed two for the size of the order. Love the atmosphere. Will come back.
Brett C.,/user_details?userid=B9w-sXsmfpICBaEsIVPWyQ,"Dallas, TX",2/18/2020,4,Nice meal. I'd been past this place a few times later in evening and was super packed. Went back earlier another day and got a seat no problem. Staff were super nice and enjoyed some classic Greek fare that was executed well and a neat little area.
Shirley L.,/user_details?userid=FAjSmZsKGPWmJMXMUWk-Ew,"Queens, NY",4/20/2018,2,"I went to try it out with my friend on an early evening on Thursday around 5pm. It wasn't crowded yet, but by 6pm, people started to come through the doors. The service was ok.  Food wise, we ordered appetizers and the carbonated fruit juices.  I've had better Grilled Octopus. It didn't look like it was grilled at all and didn't taste great.  Eggplant dip (Melitzanosalata) was good and the bread was warm from the grill.  Zucchini chips were ok. Fries came with some mustard sauce was good.  Briam was good too.  The fries and zucchini chips together probably wasn't a good idea as we were full really fast from all the grease. The carbonated fruit juices were good. Overall, it wasn't as amazing as other reviews hyped it up to be. Then again everyone has different taste buds."
Leonard F.,/user_details?userid=OJnbSdrgGpnf_ffoJLlj0g,"Queens, NY",7/13/2018,3,"This restaurant has a quite charming neighborhood-spot for locals kind of feel. I came for lunch and I imagine the atmosphere is even more engaging at dinner.  However, the food was pretty unremarkable, OK and reasonably priced, but not in my opinion in the same league as various Greek restaurants on the Upper East Side and in Astoria.  The Taramasalata was not fishy enough, and not very creamy either -- too starchy. The Moussaka was a bit dry and bland."

Peggy C.,/user_details?userid=eRCQMWE2tNuN7hXKUUfymA,"Los Angeles, CA",2/11/2018,5,"Honestly, I don't normally even go for Greek food as my first choice, but on a recent trip to New York, Kiki's was by far the best meal I had and I LOVED it. It was just the perfect combination of great service, really fun atmosphere that made us feel like we had found something special, and fantastic food. My friend and I came in for dinner on a Sunday and luckily we managed to get seated immediately. Didn't have trouble finding the location - just be prepared to not be searching for a sign that says ""Kiki's"" (I'd suggest looking at photos of the exterior here on Yelp to help you). I love the decor, which is super charming - also, note to restaurants, the idea to stick a small shelf next to the table for condiments, silverware and the candle is so SO smart...more people got to do this! We ordered a spanikopita, whole branzino, moussaka, and the ekmek kataifi for dessert along with wine. All of the portions were massive but so good and hearty. The spanikopita was so good, the branzino was charred perfectly on the outside and moist on the inside. I've never had moussaka before, and I feel like it was similar to a shepard's pie (and delicious). We were so full we had trouble finishing the ekmek, but try we did since it was such a fun mix of flavors and textures. Our server was so lovely, and when he heard we were in town for a while, he quickly wrote down a list of other restaurants he recommended in the LES area. Just a crazy good experience all around, and I would definitely come again next trip."

To our surprise, we were seated immediately! The food did not disappoint. I had the Kiki's breakfast--eggs, tomatoes with feta, potatoes and a piece of bread. Each element was delicious. The eggs were light and fluffy and the feta tasted very fresh. There was also a generous amount of delicious olive oil. The lemon sauce was excellent. My friend had the feta toast and loved it--though it was on the small side. Probably not a good choice if you're super hungry. The food was also very affordably priced. I really have nothing bad to say about Kiki's. I'll definitely be coming back!"

The portion was sizable, definitely big enough for 2 to share. My friend had the moussaka which she gave 2 thumbs up on. I had the whole branzino which was one of the best I've ever had. Moist and flaky inside with a crispy skin. For dessert we shared the Ekmek Kataifi which was good. The cheesecake and yogurt both looked good too.

The only one problem about this place is the temperature: was super crazy cold. Heat system didn't work at all! It was very cold outside and we were running to get into the worm spot to have a dinner,  but had got even more cold than before."
Fatima K.,/user_details?userid=5CTtLuISzjo5tKPduVqYrA,"Rochester, NY",3/27/2019,4,Extremely flavorful nourishment at a truly sensible cost. Everybody at the table sway faltering.

Penelope M.,/user_details?userid=jtx0pnIDrn5f1EGMQ9jjDQ,"Fanwood, NJ",2/13/2017,3,"Very rustic and intimate that you can actually whisper nonsense to that stranger in the next table. Everytime I try a new restaurant, I peruse the menu beforehand so by the time we walked into the place, looking at the menu was just a formality.  However, this time I didn't get to order what I had in mind, as my husband was lured by the Mixed Grill. The lamb chops did come flavorful, medium rare with a nice char and crust. The rest could use a bit more of salt. Grilled Octopus was tender, a squirt of lemon, or that wonderful vinegar present on all their tables- made it tastier. Our waitress informed us that Calamari was the special for that day. ""We'll take that,"" my husband added. I would have liked to try their catch of the day. It would have paired well with the  spanakorizo. Saganaki - honey and cheese, and sesame seeds, hmm - this may be the best among what we tried here. Also, the warm pitas and grilled sliced bread with olive oil.  We finished 2 servings of those. We ordered Moussaka to go and I ate it for breakfast, after adding a pinch of Kosher salt and a sprinkle of freshly cracked pepper, it became the best dish I've tried there."

Although the wait is typically about an hour for a table of 3+ the service is very fast once you are seated. Each dish that I have had was delicious and reasonably priced.

Andrea W.,/user_details?userid=oqCtfkf3IcwLF7A5iLlxlQ,"San Jose, CA",6/14/2019,3,"I was a bit confused in trying to find the spot because there are no signs anywhere that this is where the restaurant is! In any case, I found it and when we arrived on a Friday night close to 6:30PM, the place was quite empty. It did fill up as the night went on though. In any case, we were told to sit anywhere we'd like, so we did. I ordered the moussaka, and the food took a while to come out which was a good sign (or so I thought). My food was lukewarm, but the top of my moussaka was crunchy. I thought the balance of meat to potato to eggplant was not very good as there was way too much meat and not enough eggplant and potato. The flavor was just of beef which I guess is expected, and in general I thought it was just okay. Ambiance was alright but I could see the place being really dark if it were dark outside; since it was still light outside, this wasn't a problem. Service was acceptable as our waters were refilled appropriately, dishes were cleared when we were done, we were offered dessert, and we were given the check in at timely manner. The food was a bit pricey at a bit more than $18 post-tax for the portion and quantity of the food."
Sol C.,/user_details?userid=_JMJOpOL9chL10nlSYhaqA,"Encinitas, CA",2/15/2017,4,"Very solid Greek food at Kiki's, a trendy restaurant on the Lower East Side. Friendly waitstaff. No reservations are taken so come relatively early to avoid a wait. On a Wednesday at 6:30 pm many tables were open but by the time we left there was a line at the entrance. In particular, I would recommend the tender octopus, which was simple and fabulous. Also, we loved the saganaki (warm cheese wrapped in phyllo and topped with honey and sesame) and the melt-in-your-mouth moussaka. The menu is loaded with great options so it's hard to choose; coming with a large group may be the best way to go!"

However, what is rediculous is they charge extra if you use a credit card. What kind of policy is this? The service was average."

Great for a relaxed date and the neighborhood is fun. I hear this place is popular and there can be a long wait but when we went at 5p we walked right in. Will be back!

There was a large amount of dried oregano on every dish and it seemed like this may be their signature. It was not super high quality oregano and I really didn't enjoy that. Quite pricey for the food, but the scene is good. They do not take reservations (you walk in and put your name on a massive list, but they will call you). There was an overwhelming smell of floor cleaner where we were seated."

Host was friendly but the wait staff were not attentive - proof was immediately provided when we were served two glasses of warm tap water. Not room-temperature-warm! Ordered the shrimp appetizer, which, served with a bread & pita basket, was delicious. Sadly, the main course was greatly disappointing. The $28 whole Red Snapper was very dry and was accompanied by inedible spinach rice, the ""roasted"" chicken was a small portion that looked like it had been stewed since it was pale with soggy skin. (And still managed to be dry!) Finally, the lemon potato side-dish was overly boiled with a strange lemon taste. Overall, an underwhelming and very disappointing meal. We won't be returning."

Blake T.,/user_details?userid=oJbK-5SeXsFAIBKS0R8FNA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2/1/2020,5,This food is expectational. My biggest complaint would be that they don't offer a sampler appetizer with all the dips. Each dip is $9. Offer 4 of the dips together for $22 and give a smaller portion. Too many things on the menu we were not able to try everything with a party of 4. Consider doing a dip platter- otherwise keep it going guys. Highly recommended

There is one woman who is extremely rude that honestly makes me want to never come back despite the delicious food."
Ashley N.,/user_details?userid=D4C_M_i6lz7tWurRUaO-XA,"Manhattan, NY",12/13/2018,4,I've stopped by this place to pick up some lunch to go. I was really craving a fresh salad and I use to work around the area. Kiki's beet/apple salad really caught my eye. Especially since there's not a lot of places in this area that make anything outside Chinese food. At around 12 I came in to order and came out with my salad fairly quickly. Their menu includes a lot of traditional greek items which sounds delicious. I was very close to ordering their octopus and a dessert but that would be way too much for me to eat during lunch. I loved my salad! The beets and apples combined were just so refreshing and that was exactly what I was looking for. If I still worked in the area I would definitely stop by here for lunch or after work dinner.

Had the lamb chops, greek salad which had an amazingly big tatsy slab of feta. The traditional moussaka didnt taste potato heavy but almosy like a lighter custard. Dam good. They were out of the branzino but the other fish, Dorado was a new try and worth every penny. Picts speak for themself."

My friend and I ordered the grilled octopus (it didn't really taste like octopus though), mama's oven roasted chicken and moussaka. The restaurant is dark and it's not as small as what you see from the pictures."

Everything there is good so its more a matter of finding what is the best and the best thing without a doubt on Kiki's menu is the saganaki. Order it."

But by far the BEST THING I've ever experienced in my life - that cheesecake! Good lord!! It was actually the Platonic ideal of a cheese cake. Come try it out and you'll believe me :) My absolutely only complaint is that there's no liqueur, just beer and wine. But the cheesecake (and many cocktail bars in the area) more than makes up for it. PS Cody and Erika (servers) were the best!"

We had tzatziki, octopus, briam, horiatiki, and mixed grill, with a 0.5L carafe each of house red and rosé. I was worried about some of the negative reviews on here, but I found them unwarranted. The mixed grill was exceptional--I especially liked the bifteki, a perfectly seasoned beef burger with a surprisingly light texture. Looking forward to coming back and trying more things!"
Jennie C.,/user_details?userid=aipqyWAIVco1BV9L5U4Geg,"New York, NY",7/18/2016,4,"Ok so it started off bad.... Put our name down, was told an hour wait....didn't get seated until 2 hours later. Gave our name number and went to their sister restaurant/bar ""forget me not"" two doors down. Had some.., well a lot of drinks before we realized how long it had been. One person from our group went to check on our status... They gave our table to someone else without even calling us and then we finally got seated 30 min after. Why still 4 stars? The best octopus I have EVER had! Better than marea... Yup I said that. It was so tender and juicy I was in heaven. The food here is phenomenal!! Everything we ate was amazing and despite the long wait the service once we were seated was exceptional. I officially love this place and am dying to go back. We had tzatiki, feta fries, octopus and the whole red snapper and everything was on point! Only downfall is no full bar but they have awesome Greek wines. If you like Greek/Mediterranean food you have to try this place. It is in a slightly strange area but totally worth the trek and the 2 hour wait... I don't think I have ever felt like food was worth a two hour wait... The margaritas next door definitely helped diffuse the annoyance."

A cool, cavernous environment. Always a line. Love the spanakopita, the saganaki (phyllo filled with cheese, drizzled with honey), the yigantes, spanakorizo, the handcut fries... horiatiki salad is super fresh and crisp. My friend loved her lamb chops. The only negative thing I have to say: when I was there over the summer, there was a giant cockroach on the wall behind us and it crawled under the table. I honestly don't get that freaked out my roaches (if it was a rodent, I would've been a lot more upset), but my friends were disgusted and squatted on their chairs. I think since they keep the windows open, this kind of thing can happen. The waitress was very apologetic and sent over tons of free desserts. A wonderful cheese cake and some baklava."
Farzan A.,/user_details?userid=tPUAMSKQnt0XF_Ux1Hhq0Q,"Daytona Beach, FL",1/24/2018,5,Just wow wow wow . Everything we got from this place just blew my mind. The squids wow. The lasagna brother wow. The salad wow. The wine wow. But sadly the desert has scarred me for life. I mean i will never be able to have cheesecake again. Because i will compare it to here. Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww i ordered twice. I will always remember the taste and texture of it. Thing will never be the same again. Too bad i live in LA California. I will miss this place.

Kristina P.,/user_details?userid=M1nxEpMQVwQhLTZGiWxCcQ,"Manhattan, NY",3/2/2017,5,"Atypical Greek restaurant. Located in a tavern type space, it has two rooms and lots of seating so wait times are very decent! Great staff. We decided not to wait for a table and sat at the bar. However the staff let us know that a table had opened and offered to move us if we preferred. I had the Mama's Oven roasted chicken which comes with lemon flavored potatoes. Don't be fooled by the simple name, it is different from your typical chicken/potatoes and is DELICIOUS. perfectly cooked and very tasty. Big portion so can be one of the things to share if you're ordering different dishes. Will definitely come back to try more things!"

The horiatiki salad also served in the traditional way also very good. For our entrees we tried the pastitsio and Yiayia's chicken with lemon potatoes. Pastitsio was just ok -bechamel was too thick and bland, meat sauce could have been more seasoned and pasta overcooked. Chicken and lemon potatoes also just ok.  Ambiance lively and decor is old world but a bit shabby. Service was slow but probably because it was very busy. Not sure I would come again."

They don't debone the fish for you so that's a little frustrating. The house wine is a kind of Pinot Grigio/ moscato like wine which I enjoyed but is very sweet. There's no a/c so think I'll go back on a cooler evening.

It has an intimate vibe and is great for ordering family style and sharing. Order a carafe of wine for the table! Oh and did I mention that the authentic Greek fare is delicious??
Kathleen W.,/user_details?userid=FpdLcvI2jR1eFHf18BB7sQ,"Brooklyn, NY",11/30/2018,5,"Kiki's is one of my favorite restaurants, especially when you get there off peak hours (early dinner, lunch on the weekends, etc). It's the kind of place that's best enjoyed when the table shares lots of plates, especially for groups of 4 or less. The eggplant dip is delicious as is the moussaka and I also love the horiatiki. They also are extremely generous with freshly made bread and pita as well as their portion sizes. Be sure to save room for the Greek yogurt with fruit preserves!"

Despite having lots of groups waiting on a busy evening, they had two-tops available so we were sat immediately. Had no idea how big the space was, it looks tiny from the outside. Service did not suffer even though it was packed. He was quick and efficient, left us to chatting. The food was really simple, good comforting and delicious. So reasonably priced too, which explains thr younger NYU type crowd. Normally that would annoy me (it did a tiny bit, not my favorite area to go out anymore), but I had heard such positive things and wanted a cheapish good dinner. We got a bunch of small things to share, all vegetarian and nothing disappointed. My favorite.... can't decide... I remember the spinach pie, lemon potatoes, and that red cheese dip!"

Alen G.,/user_details?userid=oQDi0T6RdBgnxb0ishrgEg,"Marietta, GA",7/7/2018,2,"Food is okay, but service is pretty bad. We were told repeatedly when we called in that they don't take reservations for small groups. Fine, so we went early and got seated at a 4 person table for 5 people in our party. However, when a larger table opened up (seats 6), we asked the waiter if we could switch as it was hot and we have yet to get any of our food. Yet, we were told that the table is reserved (I thought no reservations?) and later, when the party showed up, it was 4 people (which they definitely could have sat at our table designed for 4). I'm not sure if they were just unwilling to accomodate our switch as they have already sat us or something didn't add up. In any case, the food was decent, but made worse by the fact that we had to squeeze 5 in a table for 4 on a hot summer day when a 6 person table was supposedly open. Hopefully you guys have better luck than we did."
Xu Z.,/user_details?userid=5ozMzAG_VHIVHlAcd5GU3A,"New York, NY",5/28/2018,4,"As you walk in, under a  Chinese sign, you will be surprised by the rustic charm of this greek restaurant. We didn't try many dishes, but what we tasted was fresh, delicious and comforting. We had a classic Greek salad with a generous amount of feta and a couple of olives; followed by the interesting moussaka with a pleasant cinnamon flavour. We also tried the lamb stew with fennel: the flavour was bland but somehow we enjoyed it! I recommend spending a little bit more and avoid the red house wine. Overall, an enjoyable dining experience."

Jennifer M.,/user_details?userid=IdIh-3CC74KERHW338DhTA,"New York, NY",2/3/2019,4,"This used to be a Chinese print shop and it still has a Chinese awning, so don't get confused when you arrive.

I recommend Moussaka and cheesecake. Cheesecake is really good with fresh strawberries on top."
Annie N.,/user_details?userid=GpxJbDsAm_Ss2jkPNCDONg,"Woodside, NY",7/8/2018,4,"Went here earlier so the place was not packed yet.  Good service good food.  Ordered the lamb medium well and it was still juicy not gamely at all. Served with their special mustard sauce...tasty!  Mom said it was the best lamb she's ever had!!  Well done Kiki's!  Ordered the beet salad which was good. The spanakopita was well done as well not too cheesy, heavy on the spinach the way I like it.  Baklava was a nice ending to the meal, served warm by the way.  Paid $62 for 2 people.  Yelp needs to update prices on their website, prices are quite different from menu.  I would definitely come back here to try other dishes and repeat the beet salad and lamb chops! Thank you Kiki's please remember the us!"

Three hours.  In any case, the food was just blah.  Moussaka was too soggy, lamb was super fatty, but the saganaki was dope.  My advice is to avoid this restaurant on a weekend night, if not altogether."

Super intimate and dim lighting, perfect for a date! Went last night with a friend and we ordered the fava bean dip as an appetizer, Chicken Pita with fries (soooo much for one order!), and Mama's Chicken with lemon potatoes. The fava bean dip was decent, not the best I had but super interesting flavors since it's topped with cooked down tomatoes and plenty of capers; however the bread and pita they served with the dip was very good. The chicken pita was good for what it was, it's just a pita sandwich. Mama's Chicken was exceptional though; not sure what type of cream sauce covers the whole plate but I definitely want the recipe. Everything was absolutely good. Service was a little slow but they were busy last night and it seemed like there was only one waitress working the whole floor. There's no bar but they do serve beer and either a red, white or rose wine ..super simple. I stumbled on this place just doing a random Greek food search and I'm glad I decided to go. Check it out, don't be shy."

The table got 3/4 of the entrees, missing the extra lamb chop. The extra lamb cop came 17mins later, and still is missing a dish. The restaurant isn't busy, and other tables being serve with multiple servers. Also we are a group that likes to eat when all plates are on the table. We literally watched them put the missing order in. They claim to be down a kitchen guy, but all apps and other tables food has been coming out in prompt timing. Very disappointed in the service, also the food runner just drops food on table without asking who has which food, I can go on about how bad our experience is but I don't have the energy. Cheers"

At first glance, didn't expect much but when we ordered several small plates & a delicious salad I thought the food & restaurant was great. It is much larger than I thought with different back rooms. The grilled octopus was terrific as was the eggplant dish and the salad with feta. The cheese wrapped in phyllo dough was amazing!  Only thing I didn't like was the layout & where we sat, up against the window on bar stools next to the bar which was very loud. Would highly recommend this restaurant."

Pro tip, entrance is on Orchard, not division. Good sized servings and delicious. The size of the place is decent, but kind of spread out so you may get lost, that being said it's a bit crowded and the 7 party group we had were cut off by a pillar (just ignored the people on the other side.) Might be a bit loud, and there might be a wait if you get there during rush hour, but absolutely worth it. Hang by the bar and order a drink (poor draft selection though). The bread/pita is amazing when dipped into various foods. Oh don't ever forget the fries."

Rosie J.,/user_details?userid=514cnV0afo118Rut0ETc5w,"New York, NY",12/23/2017,3,i loved all the food but they're all small and pricey. i went in on a thursday night around 8pm. no wait. i was seated at the bar while a table was available. i ordered house wine which was not my taste so i would not recommend that. i started ordering the octopus. finished it very quickly because it was quite yummy and the dish was way too small. got seated and ordered the snapper. the snapper has a lot of meat but it also has a lot of bones if you're not into that. the potatoes that came along with this dish were literally 4 strips of potato wedges. i wasn't full so i ordered the meat dish which contained of 3 small beef patties and french fries. i enjoyed this dish more.

So happy they decided to take me here because the food was incredible. Everything we ordered was delicious. We shared every dish we got, so I got to taste lots of new flavor pairings. The house wine was also excellent. The atmosphere was also great. Only have wonderful things to say about Kiki's. I highly recommend it. Will definitely be back soon!"

George P.,/user_details?userid=D8HspuehP63Z1ZjC7RExAQ,"Southampton, NY",12/14/2017,3,I could tell by it's color that the taramasalata would be excellent and I was right.   Mild and not too salty.  The fried zucchini was good but not great.  I appreciated the very light batter but they were very greasy.  The roast lemon chicken with potatoes was the biggest disappointment.  The potatoes were hard and did not have the time to absorb the cooking juices. The chicken itself needed more time too and the sauce was thickened in an artificial way.
Taylor P.,/user_details?userid=9q07Oik7jzlAq_8LXIOFmA,"Manhattan, NY",4/22/2017,5,"everything is so fresh, the octopus and anything with their feta is not to be missed. decently priced for how good it is, very dark inside but very busy on a saturday night at 8. i suggest sitting at the bar and ordering there or reserving ahead for large parties. fun for a birthday or other occasion"
Zena D.,/user_details?userid=EsVYVJ0HCcId9jOCVLV4BQ,"New York, NY",5/10/2017,5,"YES. I've been waiting for a place that hits the spot as well as Kiki's has. Don't get confused by the fact that their awning doesn't have their name on it. This place is sensational. Quality food with amazing flavors. I already love Mediterranean food, but they do everything right. If you don't know where to start...get the octopus salad. It will change your life. Flavorful, grilled to perfection, and not dry in the least. I also got moussaka which was an explosion of delicious flavor. This had eggplant, potato, ground beef, and a healthy dollop of love. I cleaned my plate and then happily watched my friends finish their generous mixed grill dishes which were also cooked very well. You should do yourself a huge favor and try Kiki's out!"

Kim V.,/user_details?userid=RUbxx6-HU9bJlD-YnjdX6Q,"Davis, CA",4/1/2018,4,"Really good quality greek food. It's not like any normal restaurant. We had to wait 1,5h to get a table, but it was worth it.. The table is lit by a candle so it's hard to read the menu, but it does create a good vibe. Asked the waiter for recommendations on tapas; all his recommendations were amazing. We ordered tzatziki, spanakopita, spanakorizo, zucchini chips, grilled octopus, roasted lemon patatoes and a salad. Definite favorite were the patatoes and octopus! I did not like the Spanakopita at all (which the waiter told us not to get), because it was very dry. Everything else was very tasty too."
Courtney S.,/user_details?userid=0PCBgi6Nlgi45vMHI97tvQ,"New York, NY",10/24/2019,5,Kiki's is amazing literally every dish we have ever gotten has been outstanding. Only thing I wish was that they did reservations because if you come at prime time you could wait two hours for a table. I've came pretty early on a Sunday before and didn't have to wait.

Vicky C.,/user_details?userid=pNPfAuN_WevrZWvLYclCZg,"Brooklyn, NY",8/31/2017,3,"First time having Greek food, food was okay ( probably because i'm not use to the flavors). But will definitely try again some other time. Zucchini chips were a bit too salty for me, grilled octopus was kinda sour, the pastitchio and moussaka were good at first but gets ehh after a couple more bites. The complimentary cheesecake was prob the best of the meal."
Alex K.,/user_details?userid=N3kxioHlY-K1L-IMkIl4sg,"Camden, NJ",4/5/2019,5,"Excellent Greek food that tastes fresh and is in a quaint location. If you enjoy fresh seafood, wine, and salads, then this should be your next stop!"
Jess H.,/user_details?userid=ti4laAw3VEdhLQKn3xx5sQ,"Kansas City, MO",12/17/2017,2,"My husband and I were both disappointed with this place. First off, it was at least 85 degrees in the building last night and felt like a sauna - way to hot for enjoyment & so hot I couldn't even finish my meal. The staff was just ok, not very pleasant, and definitely didn't try to earn their tip. The food was very bland & not worth the money. The 2 things we enjoyed were the saganaki & the decor."
Lana J.,/user_details?userid=AzXZ9lZzwUqSvxabrYW-lw,"Manhattan, NY",6/11/2019,5,"Really cool place to come for drinks and apps.  The restaurant is pretty large with different rooms, and overall has a pretty good ambiance.  I can't speak for the entrees, but my friend and I shared the tzatziki dip and fried calamari.  I generally don't love tzatziki, but it was really good and found myself eating a lot of it, ha.  The calamari came out piping hot, was very fresh, and was a large portion.  We shared a bottle of rose that was also delicious.  Get here before 7pm during the week to avoid a long wait."
Nadia H.,/user_details?userid=Nn16FXpTYf3HgVlbWOYZ_g,"New York, NY",8/16/2017,5,This place is unreal. Usually a little wait for a table but totally worth it. Best Greek food I've had in NYC.
Mimi S.,/user_details?userid=e-mXS6uyr_9ZPaYEuJ5Iuw,"New York, NY",12/4/2015,4,"Very intrigue to see what this place could offer. Ordered fish, catch of the day (ask the waiter what fish they have for the day before you order). We got a red snapper grill to serve, add pepper and salt and its a winner. We also ordered several appitizers zucchini chips lightly salted with cheese on top, greek salad, very light and a good choice to start,  grill octopus was tender and flavorful.  All very good. Will definitely go back!"

Monica S.,/user_details?userid=WOEuRaN1iRPiHVRuQ4SFZQ,"Oceanside, CA",9/24/2017,5,"KIIIIII KIIIIIII'S !!!!!!!! Kiki's, your killing it. The location, the lighting, the cozy bar, and most importantly, THE FOOD !! If you are in NYC, make your way to the lower east side for the most legit Greek food and Greek wine. It's super cute and cozy, not crowded by other restaurants.. and in a cool neighborhood for low key drinks after. GO. You won't regret it."
Shamone D.,/user_details?userid=_V3p5ChwiX74jD6jXayCUQ,"New York, NY",9/16/2016,3,"This is a really nice place. The set up is great and the staff is friendly. However, me and my husband did not enjoy the food. Every course even the wine was bland and did not represent greek food well at all."
Tam T.,/user_details?userid=cMenfVsm9ZArg3WsimX8rA,"New York, NY",3/19/2017,4,The food is solid but maybe a little bit over rated.......! However it is a fun vibe and the servers are nice.
Stacie P.,/user_details?userid=80HAWzGto4Wwa0EmzMfqlg,"New York, NY",5/31/2016,5,"Probably the best and most authentic Greek food I've had in the city. Reasonably priced, food is cooked perfectly.

Ray C.,/user_details?userid=XYd-asYTSL4tOgDjWaD0NQ,"San Francisco, CA",3/23/2017,5,"Fantastic spot in the LES/Chinatown area. Definitely the best greek food in the city (considering food and value and vibe).  everything comes in good portions, the waiters are really friendly and it wont break the bank. They have a lovely house wine that is probably like $12 for a generous half carafe. The best souvlaki i've had and the moussaka is out of this world. But the best is the cheesecake. They don't always have it as it sells out so go early and make sure you order this. I've been 3 times so far and it's only been available once. Perfect for larger groups too so you can try more things!"
Konstantinos S.,/user_details?userid=kTaR4BPWKjh2t5IiF1hQJw,"White Plains, NY",8/13/2015,4,"Great atmosphere great place great food. I'm coming a lot for my lunch break from work and every time I am satisfied. I already had the pastitsio and the moussaka and last time I had the Greek salad and the ""kikis kayaka?"" Omg it was great I was so full with the dish that I left half of the salad ( I didn't want troubles with my wife later at home for dinner lol) the space is really cool and the waitress was perfect and really helpful plus smiling it makes your food taste different than cranky attitude in other places. I will be coming again since I'm all week around here."
Sashia K.,/user_details?userid=X_u1_UjqgKErgSv_4C1QVw,"HI, HI",6/7/2017,5,"Very cute restaurant that reminds me of eating out locally when we visited Greece.   Everything is well priced and we had an amazing meal.  It's well worth the wait.  Put your name down, go grab a drink, and come back for dinner and wine.  The octopus was very soft and cooked to perfection!"
Russell M.,/user_details?userid=_cvxQOABxCYJ_xCme3Q8sg,"New York, NY",5/30/2016,5,Had brunch on Sunday with a friend of out of town- have been here 7 or 8 times now and I just love this place and Kiki and the food and the vibe. At brunch when its warm out its particularly nice if you can get a table by the window that opens fully out onto the street. This place is very close to my heart.
Eric M.,/user_details?userid=pFktgSxZmmgy91_K2x4CWQ,"Oakland, CA",6/6/2019,5,"Absurdly good. Definitely the best Greek restaurant that I've been to in the city. The lamb dish (I don't remember what it was called) was crazy tender and delicious, and even better, they have an excellent traditional horiatiki salad (ie. what ""Greek salad"" is based on). I'll be visiting again and telling my friends."

The price you have to pay for good food and decent prices is not always worth it if you want to enjoy a nice dinner out. It's always packed, so most of the time you must wait for a table ( not always the worst thing), which also means the place is quite loud ( again, not always the worst thing). In addition, the service is terrible.Most times I have been there the servers were surly hipsters, and popular items were just ""not available"" that night. For me, the annoying factors usually add up to another destination....after all, there are so many choices in this area."

The place looks small at first but they have a larger dining room on the other side. We got the traditional Greek salad and the Mixed Grill for two. The salad was simple yet tasty and the mixed grill was very filling- we were not able to finish the fries. We also got to try some Greek sodas!
Valerie G.,/user_details?userid=r7GHYNcXMwCxd5SIHNBsAQ,"Montreal, Canada",11/23/2016,5,"Came in sat at the bar and ordered: 1 Horiatiki greek (no lettuce) salad and some Yigantes beans to share, One Pastitchio et one Moussaka both very good, the portions are quite generous and the price is fair. We were talked into ordering the dessert by some fellow bar diners called an Ekmek(sp),which I had never tried before.  It was really impressive and a bit difficult to describe,but I can tell you that I am not a big dessert person but this was light and airy, and just very satisfying,so add to list.  The decor is very cozy and the wait staff are professional and friendly.  A must try if your in the area or looking for some good reliable greek cuisine."

We did not see our waiter after we ordered. We had to literally walk away from the table to go get him and then inform him that 1) we wanted our check and 2) he forgot two of our dishes. Even after we tracked him down and informed him that he forgot multiple dishes, he was unapologetic and actually brash in his response. When you're going to a restaurant rated like Kiki's, you'd expect decent service or at least the waiter to treat you like a human being."
Vikash S.,/user_details?userid=U9BOAa32JoTVr2EwgSBagg,"Portland, ME",2/21/2017,5,"9/10: This is a gem of a Greek restaurant tucked away in a part of the LES that I rarely make it to. While the wait times can be long (and there is a reason for that!) we were able to find a seat at the bar within 15 mins. The service was casual but attentive and quick. The food arrived pretty quickly as well and everything that we ordered was great (the spinach pie was slightly dried out but still tasted delicious). The Greek salad and grilled octopus are a must. Great experience overall and one that won't break the bank, I'll definitely be back!"
Tatiana T.,/user_details?userid=_9Fxk4uoypWAzsfOh1zQtw,"Houston, TX",8/27/2017,5,Cool staff! Awesome food. Come not starving cause it's a wait and they don't accept reservations.
Linda Z.,/user_details?userid=d1JhMG7-EwEIYdGUHv49RA,"Brooklyn, NY",7/16/2016,5,"I've visited Kiki's four times and am charmed by the food, people, and atmosphere every time. Kiki herself seats you at your table and greets you like you're a friend. The food arrives quickly and wait staff is always attentive. Party favorites that are always seen at my table: the roasted eggplant dip, grilled octopus, lemon potatoes and  classic Greek salad. Kiki's lifehack: forego a meat entree, order my favorites to share, and definitely get the cheesecake."
Michael C.,/user_details?userid=ebSrBDJJ-oBVWYt1h0PIQQ,"Manhattan, NY",11/8/2016,5,"Awesome place. Awesome Greek restaurant in Chinatown, who woulda thunk, LOL. Love how they left the Chinese shop signs outside. Wine list is affordable, with good selections. The food is delicious and they do not skimp in the servings.

Romain G.,/user_details?userid=2eGTQeJ0pLmSZ6grRLznZA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/10/2017,4,"Finally went to Kiki's last Friday for dinner! The wait is a bummer: we were a large group of 8 people and were told we had to wait almost two hours. We went to wait in a bar nearby and they actually called us after just one hour. The food was fantastic, the service was great and super quick, it is not expensive, the place is cute and lively. I cant recommend it enough!"
Eric G.,/user_details?userid=R7ocyD90NK6CDz_u7MwqPg,"Manhattan, NY",3/28/2017,5,"One of my favorite spots. Great food at a great price. Service is terrific. Can't wait to eat here again soon.

Victoria A.,/user_details?userid=RQF_rsM6-K604e4cG4ViOg,"Jersey City, NJ",9/30/2017,5,"Kiki's. Is. Amazing. We came in at 7pm on a Friday so naturally the place was super busy, but we were sat right away. The vibe of the place is so trendy and open and airy! We had a pretty big group so we ordered a bunch to share and everything came out really fast. We got tyrokafteri, tzatziki and saganaki to start. Still thinking about the saganaki tbh. And then moussaka, pastitsio, and a mixed grill. I'd recommend every single thing. Moral of the story, go to Kiki's and order one of everything. Except the saganaki; get two of those."
Pee G.,/user_details?userid=clBWvVP0L7rtdu3TDP3z4Q,"Rancho Cordova, CA",3/11/2017,1,Would have been a perfect experience except for one exceptionally rude bitch.

Restaurant dirty and small....All this can be overlooked.....Not rude service. Outwardly I hate my job rude. I payed 3 few as much at new waffle House by arena....Service was without parallel.

If it's your first time here you should definitely get the branzino with lemon potatoes on the side and of course the octopus, oooh that octopus! And the house red to go with it, and of course end your dinner with the famous cheesecake :) yes the line might be long but it is long for a reason, just go next door to grab a cocktail and you'll be seated before you know it!"

The space is very small and cramped, which makes it tough to navigate around the tables, but lends a fun and cozy atmosphere to the place. Our large group shared a bunch of dishes family style: horiatiki, tzatziki, hummus, octopus, spanakopita, chicken with potatoes, and lots of wine. Everything was very tasty - the spanakopita was my favorite! Surprisingly great for a large group, despite being very small."
Rigo S.,/user_details?userid=7Y9XevSOD0bfxzBUB7-FSQ,"New York, NY",1/5/2017,4,"Kiki' was actually rather difficult to find since the sign outside does not say kikis. However, the food was excellent. We order the meat plate(bunch of different meets on a tray with fries) as well as the lamb chops. The lamp chops were awesome! The wine was decent with a decent selection. Fries were awesome too. Table are rather small so when out group of six was given a table then converted a table of four for six of us so it was very tight as you can imagine. The waiters were great too. I would definitely recommend and will come back to dine again!"
Ariella K.,/user_details?userid=EJQoy6cSnzuuyt3jx3eqpQ,"Los Angeles, CA",2/9/2019,4,"Really good food and not insanely expensive for how good it is and how much you get. It is, however, such a scene that it's sort of painful. The wait was longer than anticipated and people who knew the host kept coming in - I really wish you could just make a res. Either way, house wine was great, lemon potatoes and tzatziki were bomb, octopus and fried calamari were nice too."
Jessie D.,/user_details?userid=STuZ7NOKEQH9u6vFro6dzw,"Manhattan, NY",2/7/2019,5,"Delicious Greek food. Went with a group of 4 friends and we shared Mama's roasted chicken, grilled Octopus, Moussaka, and Pastitchio. Each dish was spectacular. Mama's roasted chicken came with a savory, rich, and lemon-y sauce that worked beautifully with the tender potatoes and chicken -- trust me, the lemon worked well as it brought a certain tang and sourness to the sauce. The grilled octopus slices was infused with delicious oils and juices and was very tender. I never had moussaka nor Pastitchio before but I would definitely get it again -- it certainly rivals Italian pasta. First experience with Greek food and it definitely has me hooked."
Samuele M.,/user_details?userid=zzd9s-o8jN58e_M4pYb85w,"Menlo Park, CA",6/24/2017,5,Best Greek food I had in a long long time. The octopus was spectacular. Good wine. Excellent location and service.

glyn J.,/user_details?userid=cl9PfbrH33h3k2WHxW5q-Q,"New York, NY",1/25/2017,5,"Easy to walk by this place with a cool old sign of the previous biz, love the ambiance and interesting location. The food was amazing! Starting with the saganaki, which was wrapped in phyla and drizzled with honey! Next, spinach pie..yes please...was seemingly baked in a pan rather than the traditional triangle. Octopus!! Totally delicious and tender. Lemon potatoes...perfectly cooked and lemony (I personally like mine more well done and crispy, but these were great!). Last but not least...the zucchini chips...I would go back just for them!! A big basket of paper thin zucchini gently fried and sprinkled with cheese! So good!! Service was fantastic and the place super low key. You need to go to here now!!"

When she got to me and I asked how long it would be and told her I had been there before the 3 previous parties she told me to ""speak up next time."" The food may be good but service is shit."
Gianna S.,/user_details?userid=kRTPmsfOPrDGdaZIPcrQXg,"New York, NY",5/21/2018,1,"I was extremely excited to try Kiki's after all the good reviews I read. We came on a Sunday night four girls and had to wait around 25 minutes. there was a line out the door but they said they'd call us when our table was ready. The wait was way less than she had indicated (45 min). The ambiance was extremely cute, almost cave like with 3 different sections of the restaurant and tables right in windows over the street. Aside from the ambiance, there was a lot left to be desired. We started out with the tzakziki, which was ok- probably the best thing. We then ordered what they said was like hummus, I think the fava dip. This was possibly the most disgusting hummus I've ever had. It was chalky and terrible tasting, no flavor. We also got the moussaka. This was also disgusting. It was smothered in some sort of cheese. We then got the octopus which was nothing special- straight octopus all minced up which was strange. The spanakopita was the only edible thing we ordered besides the tzakziki. Last we got the zucchini chips, which were way too fried for my liking. The service was slow we had to ask for help multiple times and the woman would not answer our questions about the menu. The only good thing was the wine- which was fairly inexpensive for a carafe (around 25). The prices were good, as was the ambiance but the food was definitely not up to par and not what we expected."

K D.,/user_details?userid=pCgcJWfZo4UbIRvt_d1R4A,"White Plains, NY",5/3/2017,4,"Unexpected tasty Greek in Chinatown! Got really hungry as we were walking around and had a late lunch...no sign but Kyknos empty tomato cans used to hold utensils and Kalas salt gave it away. We had spanakopita, grilled octopus, loukaniko  (sausage) with orange and horiatiki salad...nice server. As Greeks we would recommend it."
Ray S.,/user_details?userid=fCiMsi_6Rzf0bsILvLxzOw,"Wayne, NJ",9/11/2016,4,We sat in the private room.  The server was a very friendly and helpful gentleman.  The tzatziki sauce was very good.  I loved the spicy cheese.  The grilled octopus and Kiki's Kayanas were superb.  Kiki's Kyanas was a kitchen sink type dish that everyone loved.  Well worth a visit.
Alivia D.,/user_details?userid=LpjWwovmr3sBu6Wi9PBP_A,"New York, NY",11/2/2015,5,"Kiki's was lovely. The service was so friendly and accommodating, the food is delicious and the vibe is so cozy. The octopus is amazing - lemony, tender and charred. Super creamy tzatziki. The Briami is an amazing veggie option that even meat-lovers will enjoy! Going back asap to try the desserts :)"
Dennis L.,/user_details?userid=QB7DYCKfajkQbws6_tbgMQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/6/2019,5,Great authentic Greek food. I like that pastry with cheese and honey and the orange Greek wine. It's always busy and they don't have a sign
Carlos C.,/user_details?userid=gkYVqQQCIlbNDg6D-OZBGQ,"San Francisco, CA",4/13/2017,5,"love this place! Been several times and always eat well. There's a good, laid back vibe. Don't think you can go wrong with what you order, but the spanakopita and lamb were especially good!"
David B.,/user_details?userid=i1Vhu64KRsW7YvdKAFNzEA,"San Francisco, CA",7/6/2016,2,"Overrated. It was fine but in no way blew my mind. Eggplant mezze was nice. Everything else mediocre: branzino, grilled octopus, fava spread..."
Allison C.,/user_details?userid=-z7bz5yjJnugQDjX4dN2dg,"Brooklyn, NY",4/3/2017,5,"Such a treat. Went with a big group (not the kinda place you should take a big group, its cavernous and there is always a wait) and they were SUPER accommodating. They helped pick just the right amount of food, didn't rush us at all, and were completely lovely. It was also very affordable for the amount of eating and drinking we did. Everyone consumed pretty heartily, and it was less than $60 a person. Which is kind pretty great considering its NYC and we had 3 bottles of wine. Will definitely be going back!"

This little hidden spot at the end of orchard street at Division is endearingly charming! I loved every bite of this home style Greek food. The staff was also very attentive and sweet. Definitely coming back for dinner as just hop skip and jump from home by bikes.
Misha P.,/user_details?userid=zzxtlSq9uFbgCeOzLtuglA,"New York, NY",9/7/2015,5,"Not sure what people are complaining about below... Went here with 2 people. All had a main course, a coffee and desert for under 70$. Everything was super cheap, and  tasted good. Main thing that sucked was the wood on the table top was water damaged/ curved covexly and the table kept rocking even after the waiter adjusted shims under feet. Other than that try to beat the price, the chill atmosphere and the size of portions in this neighborhood. I live here and i don't think I can get Mexican here cheaper and have everything as delicious and presentable as it was... Haters gonna hate i guess, but if you don't have a stick up your bottom come here for some good food and you won't feel butthurt about the cost."

The food is so fresh and delicious.  I could live off of the eggplant dip and greek salad. Even when I've been here with friends on busy nights and we've finished our meals, there has never been pressure for us to pay and leave to free up the table. The service has always been great and the food is consistantly on point. For me, I don't really give a crap about the atmosphere of a restaurant, as long as the food is quality every time."

Erika U.,/user_details?userid=0AJIpXKs5kiZLDU30_Ci4Q,"Manhattan, NY",7/10/2016,5,"My close friend and I visited Kiki's as he lives in the neighborhood and spoke highly of their cuisine. We were greeted promptly and ushered quickly to our seats. The place was lively and strewn with couples sharing small plates and entrees, seemingly enjoying each bite. The food was delicious and the service was amazingly attentive. Of all the menu offerings that we tried the baklava was hands down the most amazing that I've ever had!! We will definitely return to Kiki's."
Nikki H.,/user_details?userid=noC6gy_fhSt86-hHrNj_Sg,"Trabuco Canyon, CA",7/9/2016,5,"Almost cried when I tried their cheesecake. My go-to in the neighborhood. Octopus, moussaka, mixed grill, taramasalata, and best Greek salad ever!!"
D M.,/user_details?userid=179rfzn-ngYrnHdPXkoSqA,"New York, NY",8/8/2016,5,A neighborhood go-to. You can't go wrong with the whole roasted fish and any of the salads. The yogurt with cherries and cheese cake also amazing. Always very crowded with peeps- sitting at the bar is- no problem.
Nicole K.,/user_details?userid=d_MO74TeGxq03q1aHBmMYA,"Manhattan, NY",11/28/2016,5,Came here for my husband's birthday. Had to wait as business was very good. But it was worth the wait. Food was great and value for money. Service staff was great and friendly too.

What can I say?  I usually am one of those people that takes all the food photos before we even start eating.. This time... There was no time to even speak. Such great Greek food!!  Delicious flavors that just hit the spot. Plus of of course, most delightful host Kiki - thank you!! Can't wait to go back !!"

As a Greek living in New York, I was so happy to see that a new good Greek restaurant opened downtown. The zucchini, lamb chops, house wine, and salad were all amazing! I can't wait to go back and try everything else."
Robbin J.,/user_details?userid=mplbG_NXgNTeIDFtr4vxjA,"Great Neck, NY",8/26/2016,5,"Long wait but worth it (they don't take reservations, or at least they didn't the night I went which was a weekend night). A waiter was available whenever needed and food portions were very generous for tapas (and very tasty too, of course). Waitress was very accommodating when my sister ordered a surprise slice of cheescake with a candle for my birthday. I thought the wine glasses were deceivingly served, though, as they were in little crystal glasses that were probably less in volume than the typical wine glass - but that's not enough to sway this 5-star rating. It seems loud from the outside but somehow the acoustics work to make each table a nice space for conversation. I would skip the dish with the french fry base (forget what its called) and replace it with something else."
Louis A.,/user_details?userid=dn2cTTnNO_eORDGlFmcH_w,"Poughquag, NY",5/27/2016,5,Best food and service in nyc.   Get the Lamb chops.  Everything was amazing!  From the beginning to end everything was amazing.

The sign outside is pretty cool too like it's a hidden gem.
Allisha H.,/user_details?userid=_Wvxv-NHuCNP8m-iz0s_FQ,"Brooklyn, NY",1/4/2017,5,Get the Lamb Frikasse and eat it with the pita bread that they serve when you first sit down. So delicious!!!
Emilia B.,/user_details?userid=UYeaYB5jsRTQe3D3fulgeQ,"Parkville, MD",6/18/2016,4,"Nice ambiance. Good service. Reasonable prices. The food was ok too. I had a dish of vegetables which were supposed to be grilled according to the waiter; the vegetables were not grilled, more like stewed in a sauce so that was a bit disappointing. Flavor was ok though."
Tony M.,/user_details?userid=OGI5Cx-V8BKZSJ_x1oEMuQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/26/2016,5,All round amazing. Top notch Greek Authentic food!
Hayley B.,/user_details?userid=7uTJURbGdMlq8uqomM2fIQ,"Manhattan, NY",12/23/2016,5,Kiki's in quite possibly my favorite place to eat in Manhattan. Kiki herself is so sweet and makes everyone feel comfortable and taken care of. The food and wine are both affordable and delicious. The octopus is melt-in-your-mouth good but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Get the cheesecake.
Alev K.,/user_details?userid=dsj_cceACHQPnUOl5BPg9w,"New York, NY",5/27/2015,5,"The amazing sibling of Forget Me Not. This place is not your next gyro spot, it's the ""real deal"". For the ones who have Mediterranean taste buds, try the Imam Baildi, which is a hearty eggplant dish for eggplant lovers. The rustic setting is very laid back and effortless. Must try!"

Got the grilled octopus (yes you should order this one), saganaki (not shown in my picture but it was one of my favorites), pastitchio (most basic dish in our order) and some sort of beef patties with fries (quite flavorful but basic)."
Julia R.,/user_details?userid=q1dYz4ZV2Iu4G5Zl0syrog,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",5/4/2016,5,"The food here is excellent, by far my favorite Greek restaurant in the city. The restaurant is divided in three main rooms so it gives you a cozy feeling from any seat you take yet the place is huge. Service is also impeccable and I never had any problems. If you go make sure to try the classic Greek salad called Horiatiki, the Imam Baildi which is looks like a veggie lasagna but without the pasta, and it's sooo delicious! And for dessert have the Greek yogurt with sour cherries, you won't regret it. One tip I have for anyone going here: try to make it a weekday dinner because on the weekends (including Friday) you might be looking at a 2h wait."
Siyu Z.,/user_details?userid=VZsPsYXDvGYA95cgXSsi_g,"Seattle, WA",12/6/2015,5,"Bring hungry friends, order everything. Especially that chunk of fried cheese in honey, it's the stuff of food fantasy. Chill vibes, good portions for the price."

Elizabeth H.,/user_details?userid=oITef1YunHvxegYtsUmBgQ,"New York, NY",7/15/2018,3,"Taramosalata was so gross and fishy It was inedible. I've had taramosalata at tons of Greek restaurants around NYC and this was by far the worst. The tzatziki was however wonderful!! The Yigantes were  totally bland and would probably also be the worst I've had in the city. (My husband and I Love Greek food and we often just order a few items to nibble on, this is just a review of the few items we ordered. Don't think I will order from this restaurant again.)"
Estefany S.,/user_details?userid=qC8eJqwHvyYGwIF-NXRWWw,"New York, NY",7/15/2018,5,"Never disappoints. The octopus is delicious, so is the lamb... so is everything on the menu. Expect a wait to be seated... worth it!!!!"
Jason B.,/user_details?userid=3Hn5PexeY0tir0uFWk4jJg,"Sparks, NV",11/26/2015,5,"Absolutely amazing! So glad they were open on Thanksgiving too.

There isn't another for 10 blocks!"
Sabine A.,/user_details?userid=NCDVxZ8odE6Zw13d_yc6jw,"New York, NY",6/30/2016,4,"Great food, great vibes. Always packed but the team here still manages to give top service amid the chaos of eager patrons. Expect a wait. Bide your time with a cocktail at either bar on the same block."
HMH C.,/user_details?userid=39KOPUkFzhjM_-5hJXL79g,"Brooklyn, NY",4/27/2016,3,The restaurant is nice. It felt like an adventure to discover the restaurant which is hidden in Chinatown. The food was not the best Greek food. The spicy feta was not quite right. The eggplant dip was not very flavorful. The bifstekia was burnt and the flavor was not there (Not enough onions)
Totoro R.,/user_details?userid=5oTA9gzeqYKC5v4hIPpKVA,"New York, NY",3/20/2016,5,Loved finding this spot in the neighborhood.  Delicious Greek food.  The Greek salad and grilled octopus were amazing.  Would go back again and again!
Lynette B.,/user_details?userid=ZdDI0TGqWAALp7mFaXviow,"New York, NY",1/31/2016,5,Perhaps one of the best meals I have had in years! Bruno the bartender was also on point even though I will say the wine selection left a bit to be desired.....
B B.,/user_details?userid=8cH9TNhDBNImzV0TNkOfZQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",10/8/2017,1,"This restaurant has despicable service. Waits are no shorter than 2 hours. Completely not worth the wait. They tell you to wait one time but you end up waiting more and give you an attitude about you checking up on your reservation. The waiters roll their eyes every single time you ask them for anything. The place is small, dark, uncomfortable and dirty. The customer service is lacking. So not worth the wait. Go somewhere else, save yourself the time!!"

The food was simply prepared, authentic, absolutely delicious and very fairly priced. I highly recommend the lamb chops, octopus and cheesecake."
Safi C.,/user_details?userid=4EenGlFF-rDg0AZAFSQ6SA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/11/2016,4,Certainly a must-try if you like Greek food and around the area. Very cool yet homely feel at this place and the same can be said for the food. Do try the octopus and get a few other mezzes and share them with the table alongside some drinks. Top quality restaurant.

The ambience is nice--there's good music playing but it's not so loud that you can't talk to your dinner companions and there's a laid-back vibe. The service is attentive and friendly, but not in your face. The food, for the most part, has been outstanding. I loved the tzatziki with grilled bread. However, I was disappointed on my last visit with the grilled octopus. It was clearly burnt, smelling like burnt rubber and tasting bitter. The oil it was sitting in was tasty, so I see where they were going with this, but it's a shame I didn't get to enjoy the whole experience."
Stuart H.,/user_details?userid=am18QghoNZ6e93FjwHILmA,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",8/6/2018,5,Can I give 6 stars??? Best neighborhood spot. Killer food and service. Order the lamb chops. Will definitely come back many times.

Shannon W.,/user_details?userid=AoHBjflBcp-ar4U7Kl3QZA,"Dallas, TX",9/16/2015,5,love this spot. treat yo self and get the grilled 'pus and a carafe of rose. i could spend hours/days/weeks here.
Jesse J.,/user_details?userid=AW2JykNThcYpctVJnAyZVA,"New York, NY",8/23/2015,5,"I have to say this place is fantastic. The food is absolutely delicious, not to mention cheap. Because the prices were pretty low for each dish, I assumed they were tiny little tapas, but they were actually pretty solid portions of everything. And the vibe and atmosphere are cool too. It wasn't mobbed with people when we came on a Friday, though it's hard to say whether that will last. Maybe it is out of the way enough that there will never be huge crowds."

Their moussaka was delicious though. I want to come by and try other items on the menu!"

Neky R.,/user_details?userid=EPKOeKw-UN_GltCDfHqdIQ,"New York, NY",11/5/2015,5,One of those places that you discover by accident and wish you had done so sooner. The food is great! Good prices. The Food will bring you in and the wine will make you stay longer. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
K. C.,/user_details?userid=_3FAPnLgR4lg47yzam6PqQ,"New York, NY",11/30/2015,4,"This is a nice hidden gem of a restaurant in the neighborhood, literally hidden as they seem not to have changed the signage from the old Chinese printing shop outside.  We had an assortment of dishes, all of which are fairly true to traditional Greek dishes.  The prices were moderate.  It is a large space with basically 3 separate dining rooms.  Will be back again."
Jenny K.,/user_details?userid=QULWy-bGyoYbMHO0erkUAw,"Manhattan, NY",3/20/2016,4,"Really cute spot. I loved the cozy and trendy ambiance. The service was excellent. We ordered a lot of small plates and shared. I would definitely go back. Next time, I'd want to try some of the bigger plates. I also wish we had the famous cheesecake but my group wanted to get dessert elsewhere."
Alan T.,/user_details?userid=tmq0Pmt_UCn2CnUYGUwXHA,"Denton, TX",3/17/2018,5,"I didn't think I liked Greek food, but this place had great food. The service was amazing. Great atmosphere. It was a little hard to find, but if you like hole in the wall places, this place is definitely that. Probably the shorter street in Manhattan. Kind of like the shortest verse in the Bible, ""Jesus cried""."
Ron J.,/user_details?userid=ddXur201OWYLi4POiGn15Q,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",5/11/2018,5,Great spot. Fast service. High quality food. Fairly priced. Definitely should give it a try!
Anonymous A.,/user_details?userid=airM0NMhTPW1ly2dJ10Qew,"New Orleans, LA",5/1/2018,3,"This place had cheap wine, great small plates, and a phenomenal atmosphere- tucked away in lower Manhattan. HOWEVER, we ordered a full grilled snapper and we received a FOUL fish- it smelled like a spoiled fish that had sat out in the sun for a day and completely ruined the rest of the dining experience. I would recommend this place, but skip the fish"
Marianna L.,/user_details?userid=f9inJHyQ-m92cycDC8ZOwQ,"New York, NY",10/10/2015,5,"I've been there several times and I always leave the restaurant with a great feeling, it is inexpensive, great food, I recommend the chicken and the cheesecake.

Shawn H.,/user_details?userid=BqEQ1TpQyhoRPNcM5hQzKw,"Chinatown, Manhattan, NY",9/2/2015,5,"Kiki's has great food and excellent atmosphere. I've had plenty of the menu and the standouts to me are the grilled octopus, spanakopita, moussaka, greek salad and shrimp pasta. I really love sitting in the window/bar when the weather is nice. Great greek beer as well."

David S.,/user_details?userid=9AbR5xg__SEFE8PvYyORVA,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",5/30/2018,5,Fabulous Greek food. Show up early to avoid the wait. Have the octopus. Die happy.
Raphael G.,/user_details?userid=cFD5osKNzb1BfdLcWZ9ONg,"Manhattan, NY",5/28/2016,4,I have eaten at Kikis a few times and the food has not been that consistent. I only wished that the servers knew a little bit more about the Greek eating culture. It would be helpful to us who do not know as much to be able to make that journey.Even so the crew is amazing and extremely friendly without having to ask a thousand times if the experience was great and be over your shoulder while you are eating. Something I hate in a lot of New York restaurants. House wine is good I d go for the red and saganaki is amazing  and the cheese cake is a killer. Pricing is great and it is certainly food for value. I will go back again and again and I always  recommend to others!!!  Someone greek at all times in the staff would be a great add on.
Sarah S.,/user_details?userid=HwVtGJHAiON0IPC2k203Hg,"New York, NY",7/14/2015,5,The most gracious and warm staff I have ever encountered! Delicious food to match. Wonderful night and will be back!

We had Kiki recommend some of her favorite plates to us and, well, she does know what she's doing :) I love the ambiance- feels a bit more ""social"" and warm/welcoming then a normal sit down restaurant, but still great for dates and when you want some one on one with your dinner date. Will be back and will recommend!"
Bill G.,/user_details?userid=Afj-0xVtoJYrhqStP0MJtQ,"Closter, NJ",12/10/2017,5,"You can try so many plates here for a reasonable price. The spanakopita, grilled octopus,  zucchini chips, the feta french fries, the pastitchio, and the tzaziki were all excellent."
Panagiotis G.,/user_details?userid=DdwQ9XqcLJ1oVgyuS7qZgg,"Manhattan, NY",2/21/2016,5,"My wife and I went to Kiki's for lunch. The food was incredible. We had the Dakota salad, zucchini chips, lemon potatoes , and bifteki. Every plate was delicious. We will be back!"

Heather G.,/user_details?userid=IQzYvCW9q78_0uRbK38oRA,"New York, NY",9/29/2017,5,"One of my favorite restaurants. Good vibes, great food, super reasonable prices. Good to share dishes in a group. Only bummer is the wait for a table."
Tali E.,/user_details?userid=xzrhI1cMlN6IN5VLY0d8Rg,"Manhattan, NY",9/11/2017,3,"Didn't live up to our expectations. The atmosphere was intimate despite being a large space. Got the zucchini chips, Greek salad, whole dorado, moussaka, and lemon potatoes. It was fine. The zucchini chips needed salt and lemon; the lemon potatoes (advertised as roasted) were boiled. The complimentary bread was the best part, along with the house wine for 12$."
Francesca P.,/user_details?userid=ryP-KvG8Gq55BJ_do3Lvww,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",1/18/2016,5,Best place ever!! If you want bomb ass Greek food go here! Staff is sweet and Kiki the owner is the best. The moussaka is amazing and I fantasize about it on the regular. Can't say enough good things about this place!
Melody B.,/user_details?userid=LFZbamrzhHSVjuj8qY3Nbg,"Sharon Hill, PA",10/30/2015,5,"I brought a large group (28) to Kiki's on a Monday for lunch and it was such a good experience. I was in contact with Kiki the week before and was able to pre-order our meal ""family style"". Once we arrived, we had our own room that was cozy and really cute. The staff were super friendly and once we were seated, they took our drink orders and then the food kept coming! The food was amazing and everyone was happy and impressed. My goal was to get in and out in an hour but we arrived late and still made it out on time. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in New York"
Ben L.,/user_details?userid=bd7dgKqZwse5vscd8c1aUw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/2/2015,5,"We are thrilled that Kiki's opened in the neighborhood. Great food, pleasant atmosphere, friendly and attentive service... I've been here twice with groups of four. We loved everything we ordered. The meat platter is huge, the giant beans are amazing, the octopus was sooooo tender, and all of the greek specialties (feta dip, Taramasalata, baklava, and more) were all amazing. We will be back soon."
Julie J.,/user_details?userid=NOBS3xJgcS1ek447DYYxng,"New York, NY",10/22/2015,4,Really enjoy coming here for dinner with a group of friends. Everything in their menu is delicious and easy to share with the group. Grilled octopus and lemon potatoes are great!

Danielle L.,/user_details?userid=-Jt6R-wZHmHea_2mrOaOrw,"Charleston, SC",8/6/2015,5,I finally found a greek place in new york that reminds me of my travels in greece. Great food. Def coming back!
Sunny Y.,/user_details?userid=9tr076CjJlIko0bcmJqJOA,"New York, NY",8/4/2017,5,"You might not think there is great Greek food on the edge of Chinatown, but that is where you would be wrong.  This place is a amazing.  The grilled octopus is probably my favorite. But the yogurt is another fan favorite."
Natasha B.,/user_details?userid=N8IJBENaNNEU4KoB4HYnVQ,"San Francisco, CA",3/21/2017,3,"I think this place is solid, I would say 3.5. It's got good energy, a lot of hip people, on a cool little street, it's lettering is Chinese to match the area and fast efficient service. The food is okay, at least what we had. The greek salad has all the makings of a great salad but I believe is prepared and therefore doesn't have the coolness and crunch that makes this salad perfect. It also needs more red wine vinegar. The feta and olives were good quality. Also the veggies are not cut quiet enough to mix them effectively. The grilled octopus tastes very good but definitely not fresh off the grilled, very moderately warmed, sitting out for some time temperature. The zuchinni chips are plentiful but are smushed together for some and not fried very crispy, I've usually had better. The mousakka was excellent. Nothing was at all wrong with this dish. The cheesecake was also very good but I'd like some fresh strawberries over the preserves. The wine tasted like I was in Greece again, it sent my senses whirling. They did card me which I took as a great compliment ;) I would prefer they were less timely/efficient and make my food fresh. I'm on the fence about returning, maybe/maybe not."

Tania P.,/user_details?userid=hUKDeQ8nk7Rb9cGnSwBZWg,"Morristown, NJ",11/15/2015,5,Authentic Greek food in a totally relaxed setting which reminded me of a santorini cave even though it's in the middle of Chinatown! Octopus is insanely tender. Tzatziki and xwriatiaki are perfect. Definately my favorite Greek taverna outside of Greece and totally recommended if u want the real Greek experience.
Natalie V.,/user_details?userid=EM1h77thUxdO9J7SBWjarg,"New York, NY",11/8/2017,5,"Love Kiki's! It's the first place we take people when they visit NYC. Get the spanikopita, saganaki, bifteki, horatiki, and you won't regret any of it. Cozy place with friendly staff, and also doesn't break the bank."
Potoula T.,/user_details?userid=2fwUaMmYk1oUVPF_wBTFnA,"New York, NY",4/27/2016,4,I absolutely love this hidden gem in Chinatown. They really incorporate authentic Greek food that I grew up with into the menu at a super affordable price. Try any other Greek restaurant with a comparable menu in the city and you'll end up paying an arm and a leg. I love all of their apps (meze) and their spiced bifteki is unreal. I've brought both family and friends here and they all loved it. I definitely plan on returning soon!
Deborah B.,/user_details?userid=WFKBDsQY3iAB4e2EVtfbBQ,"New York, NY",10/5/2015,5,"Had my birthday dinner there last night, and the food was amazing. Friendly staff, low key atmosphere and a fun time had by all. The grilled octopus appetizer and the shrimp main dish were spectacular. Definitely get something that requires the bread basket like the tzatiki and make sure to have the Baklava for dessert."
Mary A.,/user_details?userid=d2UbLWpUtcBk2Zg4j7yNjw,"Indiana, PA",7/6/2017,3,It was good but not great. Appetizers better than meals. I would definite go back just for the octopus and their beet salad. Service was good.
G T.,/user_details?userid=zVtIfa-2dBNunYWA36xLgA,"Manhattan, NY",4/29/2018,2,"I had the misfortune of having dinner here on a recent Saturday night at 6:30 PM.  The noise level was so high that the following day my throat was hoarse and my voice cracked. All of this just to try and have a conversation with the person sitting 20 inches away from me.  We sat at a table that was 20 inches wide so that my knees locked with the inner thighs of the person sitting across from me. There was a ceiling support pole directly in front of my face coming up through the table. We sat on high stools with no back so it was uncomfortable. They overstuffed the room with seats so there was no (and I do mean NO) room for the waiter to pass so each time the waiter went to another table he would have to ask patrons to move out of the way. The climate control system consisted of opening the door and windows to let in some fresh air and then closing them while the temperature rose to 86 degrees and then repeating the same cycle all over again until walking pneumonia set in.  I might have been willing to forgive all of the above had the food compensated for the apparent greed of the restaurant owner to put profit over palate. Not the case. The moussaka had a hard (and sometimes crunchy) thin béchamel layer when it should have featured a 2"" tall soft silkiness. It had pieces of meat instead of being ground as the traditional dish calls for.  Missing was a rich multilayered flavor profile because the seasoning was woefully underdeveloped and revealed a chef who obviously had no formal training in cooking.  That was no more evident than in the disappointing spanakopita (spinach pie) which lacked the expected dill, lemon, and tangy feta cheese flavors that should have made it an easy crowd pleaser.  The lamb chops were unremarkable and lacked seasoning.  How much could a little fresh oregano, basil or mint cost?  The pureed fava beans were unidentifiable in taste and texture and more suited to an infant's diet. The grilled octopus lacked a smoky flavor component to its skin and was obviously not marinated and prepped with fresh herbs prior to being grilled. The tzatziki was a missed opportunity to exhibit a balanced blend of garlic and dill. Instead it was a contrast between the bland and the blander.  The saganaki (fried cheese) appetizer was an abomination. It is supposed to be served flambe with warmed brandy instead it was just broiled. The ""cheese"" must have been a cheap knockoff because it lacked the strong flavor that the dish should command. How could they destroy fried cheese you may ask?  By placing it on a puddle of sweet honey.  Not even Winnie-the-Pooh would have liked it. The honey is unprecedented, unjustifiable and inexcusable. Saganaki is not intended as a dessert. The signature greek dessert, baklava, was underwhelming and unsubstantial in taste and portion size which in a way was a blessing to have less to suffer through. The galaktoboureko (semolina custard dessert in filo) dessert would have been fine had it not displayed a strong sour citrus flavor which made me wonder if it had gone bad.  Thankfully it was fresh and only the baker was bad.  On a positive note the fried zucchini chips with grated cheese were good but not good enough to redeem the multiple assaults to my mouth, body, eyes, and ears.  Perhaps this place may satisfy the uninitiated who may never have eaten at an authentic greek restaurant before and understandably have nothing better to compare it to. The owner may think doing something different is in good taste. But it just tastes bad."
Rob C.,/user_details?userid=LHTsHRVgnhkBwagj81kHkQ,"San Francisco, CA",2/2/2016,5,very very yummy greek food...lamb chops..chicken...spicy pasta....amazing octopus
Steven B.,/user_details?userid=WEsE1uR0I06ZY1p76a1_Aw,"Merrick, NY",2/19/2017,4,"This place is really charming and some great food to boot.  We started with the Horiatiki salad and the greek yogurt sweetened with cherries.  The salad was good (had great feta cheese) but the yogurt was something special.  The yogurt is smooth and along with the cherries tasted wonderful.  Also had brought out for my son the Beefteki (sp?) which was really good.  Tried the fries was good and also had a small taste of the beef.  Lastly we ordered the Lamb Fricassee...Was ok because wasn't very warm but somewhat tasty (this is why they don't have 5 stars).  We were going to get the zucchini chips but they never came out (oh well...we will have to try it another day).  In all, really good food and service."

Constance C.,/user_details?userid=U6gT7vHwG_GZusfXQsnStA,"Cambridge, MA",4/13/2017,5,"Love this place!  Wait was long, at an hour on a Wednesday night, but that's my fault for not making a reservation.  It's a wonderful mix of people inside -- older groups, families, young hip LES residents, regular New Yorkers, people from out of town.  Cool but welcoming and comfortable atmosphere.  And the food is delicious, comforting, filling, and moderately priced."
Kim C.,/user_details?userid=_wUgpI36unQD1W7oVQUsqg,"Brooklyn, NY",1/27/2017,5,"good spot for a couple pitchers of wine and some bites with friends. always super crowded, so come super early, super late, or throw down your name on the running list and go for a drink somewhere around the neighborhood. i've had every item on the menu now a few times, and while none of it is particularly life changing, everything is relatively consistent, and what more could you want from a greek watering hole? only cons- more of the roe flavor in the taramasalata would be great, and sometimes the tomatoes in the horiatiki are kind of a let down. always happy when they have the kalamari special!"

Vivian T.,/user_details?userid=PDDm6tSnrlZJ3YFaDcv-dw,"New York, NY",8/14/2016,3,affordable small plates and greek food.  cute ambience - small greek tavern hidden in lower east side with a chinese sign signaling its prior ownership from a printing company.  downside is that it is SUPER loud so be prepared to scream or raise your voice to be heard.  food  was good- acceptable. the tzatziki greek yogurt dip was AMAZING- definitely get this! the octopus and the lemon potatoes were just ok- nothing to write home about.
Fatima L.,/user_details?userid=q8g-WwabfvCkQ9-vqNFdHg,"New York, NY",8/13/2016,5,"Amazing food and great service. The fish is very good, so are the fries with feta. The waitress checked on us many times. Would definitely return!"

Stefanos P.,/user_details?userid=BKNysd4omftTNjrHZTPswA,"Elmhurst, NY",6/15/2015,5,"Ok...lets start with this first...I was born and raised in Greece and lived there for 28 years which means i pretty familiar with what the real Greek food is.  So after being almost three years in New York finally we found Kiki's place which has 100% Greek recipes and the the food its really tasteful which makes u travel to Greece for a moment. We had mousaka, grilled octopus, greek salad,tirokauteri, ntakos salad, bifteki, saganaki cheese and pasta with shrimps...all of them were just perfect. I have been to many Greek restaurants and by far i believe that the place is the best. Traditional Greek food with a very cute and cozy environment...the staff are so welcome and the noise level is low which is a big plus for a restaurant in NY especially for those who want to enjoy their food in a quiet environment. And the prices are just unbelievable compared with the quantity and the quality of the food. So if u want a really good traditional restaurant here is the one...i will definitely go back. Cozy, friendly, nice music, quiet environment, excellent food, good prices. I dont think u need more"
Ella K.,/user_details?userid=klzhL-O7XsuOIU9UliABlQ,"Bayside, Queens, NY",9/9/2016,4,Delicious and great service at a fair price! Only complaint is they ran out of their chicken and baklava.

A D.,/user_details?userid=UK2aBJAnNrYMCBuh9IZ2Lg,"New York, NY",9/13/2016,5,"Probably the best greek food I've had outside of Greece.  They have a few dishes I've never seen in the US, like the Cretan Dakos salad I ate every day in Santorini.  They also have the donkey beer, but only the red (please get some Crazy Donkey IPA!).  Place gets jammed after 7, we sat at 6:30 with no problem but there was a long waitlist later.

The beefteki is a very good deal for 10 dollars. You receive 3 balls of minced beef meat coated with a delectable char resting on a bed of hand cut potato fries. I would highly recommend tzatziki and giant beans. If you like char grilled bread, don't worry. Hellas yeah."
L S.,/user_details?userid=_5Y30UBw9wTdOWQyrCdScA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/25/2016,3,"I first went to Kiki's right around the time they first opened and I will say, the food was good then and it has remained very consistent. However, their prices have decidedly reached places that no longer make this the casual spot it continues to tout itself as. It's actually really quite pricey. They used to serve a large slice of moussaka for $11. Which felt reasonable as it was a decently sized portion. That is now $14 and the portion is the same and no side has been added. Theres been a similar $3-4 jump on a lot of the dishes (including the octopus). It'd be fine if this is how I first enjoyed/came to know of Kikis but as they had a jump in popularity, so did their prices and thats a little hard to swallow."

There is a rustic, cozy vibe to this place and the food is absolutely delicious. Very authentic greek. Definitely recommend the Tzatziki (ask for the grilled bread), grilled octopus and the Moussaka. Will definitely come back soon!"
Josh B.,/user_details?userid=dJL77Y2k0O3oEFYO_cJxxA,"New York, NY",2/9/2016,5,"This place is #magical! one of the top restaurants in NYC. cool vibe, great food. #yesplease."
L M.,/user_details?userid=DBZp5ieR5cmLSEElQrIxsg,"New York, NY",2/2/2016,5,"The best greek  food I've had in the city by far!  Came based on Yelp's reviews and was surprised beyond belief. Not only a cute, cozy place but every dish ordered was superbly flavored. If you have ALLERGIES, this is the place to go as the hostess was extremely attentive and supportive of my meal restrictions.  Cant wait to go back!"

It's got yaya's spanakopita, Greek salad, mousakka, tzarziki dip and baklava!!! Reasonable prices, original decoration and awesome awesome service (from the hostess to the waitress). House red wine is also solid."
Ben W.,/user_details?userid=bXG1LrPPIKbkACe7Y-4-fQ,"Rego Park, NY",12/19/2015,5,"Food was killer. The appetizers were all delicious, and we ordered about 7 different ones. The octopus was amazing, tzatziki was great, the sausage; just everything was unbelievably good. And to top it all off, the service was fantastic. Am looking forward to returning!"
Steve W.,/user_details?userid=dphtynZJtr-ZJQpFfoSX0w,"Los Angeles, CA",11/22/2015,5,"Current favorite neighborhood restaurant.  I come here at least once or twice a week.  Staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating and the food from appetizers to mains are just simple, clean and delicious.  You can't go wrong w. anything on the menu.  Also, their cheesecake is a must.  Only negative is ever since they got written up in the NY Times it's become hard to get a table during peak times so just a heads up."
Lisa S.,/user_details?userid=8RhVWtsbWQce31Qk-RjbKQ,"Manhattan, NY",1/31/2016,5,"This is by far one of the best Greek restaurants around.  Great food, fantastic vibe and super service.  Kiki & Nick along with their staff have created a great environment that is warm and authentic.  From start to finish every course surprises and satisfies to the point that we ordered doubles of a few things.  Great for a group and perfect for a date.  Personally I would eat there as often as possible!"
Nicole J.,/user_details?userid=AMqEp5uOPg8AYP2BVTE62w,"Manhattan, NY",8/22/2015,5,"Outstanding food and service was great.  It's in a hidden spot in Chinatown, which makes it all the more charming. I felt like I was back in Greece, from the carafe of wine to the Greek salad with no lettuce. Don't miss the grilled octopus. It was cooked perfectly.  I want to go back soon."
Tony B.,/user_details?userid=QvV1KTH_Jd-50M4HoCYP4A,"New York, NY",7/29/2015,5,"My absolute favorite!! I have been there 6 times in 6 weeks!!There is no better real Greek food. Have tried most of the menu items except some of the heavier dishes which I will leave till it is colder out. The service is great and the people outstanding, in a great neighborhood with great atmosphere...did i say I love the place??!!??"
Birgitha T.,/user_details?userid=Wviq6IMDKp_yY3wiSvVOPg,"Norwood, NJ",7/25/2015,5,"Thanks to great New York Times review, my wife and I just had lunch today at KIKI. Staff could not possibly be friendlier. We arrived a half hour before the restaurant opened, served us wine while they were getting organized. The moussaka, grilled octopus and the desert of yogurt with apples, honey and chopped nuts was a wonderful treat. With this restaurant, there is no need to go to Astoria."
Eileen M.,/user_details?userid=nsOkYFGDzhpkHybJX3Qj_g,"Manhattan, NY",7/15/2015,5,I hardly get to the lower east side but glad i did.  My friends and I had the best meal(s) and time at a restaurant (a really popular and hip place) in quite awhile.  We were greeted by Nick  who I later find out is one of the owners and his partner Kiki was behind the packed bar.   It was packed but Nick was so kind as we were there with a 93 year old senior with a cane and he made sure she had a seat while we were waiting for our table.   It was worth the wait.   The menu is loaded with wonderful greek items and the prices were so reasonable we all really went to town and ordered half the menu.   The portions were so plentiful and the food was super delicious.   We live in Chelsea but we all can't wait to go back!    Nick and Kiki please open a Kiki's in Chelsea one day soon!
Josh B.,/user_details?userid=IzgS9uVBsEJuD0iVD3bfnQ,"Grimsby, United Kingdom",8/21/2015,1,Hipster crap hole with unauthentic greek food at horrible prices. Only decent thing is the eggplant appetizer. The fact they have no menu online and the idiotic attempt to make the place unique by saying greek food or whatever in chinese characters also makes the place hard to even find. When you go in you are served soda in mason jars which is annoying because there is nothing greek about that. Right now its crowded and popular but the novelty will die down for sure. By the way I only make mention of the hipster atmosphere because going there in general for anyone else ............you will not feel comfortable eating your meal. There is nothing about that warm greek hospitality and pride in their food about this place. All people should feel welcome while eating their food so even if their food was amazing which it is not the decor and atmosphere makes it uncomfortable for the average person
Ella R.,/user_details?userid=XvhFVV7jbgdC1TtSIdTc8A,"Manhattan, NY",11/28/2022,4,Hidden gem in Greenpoint: 9 courses including 2 desserts and very filling for a fine dining experience.  Favorite was squid soup. Classy experience all around.

David L.,/user_details?userid=NV0u95G-WcjZRAfCX-jcWw,"New York, NY",10/31/2022,4,"I like it here. Everything about the space and the waitstaff is charming and pleasant. The concept is a space that hosts traveling chefs of importance. That's where it can get a bit tricky. You get what you pay for, so don't allow yourself to think that if a chef is visiting from an oversees multi-michelin-starred restaurant that they will be cooking their regular food as if in their regular restaurant. This is not me complaining, just sharing a realization. Currently, including tax and tip, the multi-course meal is $124 and the wine pairing is $78. So, no, tonight I did not receive any of the dishes I saw on Erik Anderson's instagram page from when he was executive chef at Coi when it had three michelin stars. But it also only cost fraction of that. What you get is an opportunity to have affordable glimpses with industry veterans and taste some of their expertise utilizing local sustainable ingredients, and I appreciate that. It's just sort of a downer, to be honest, because if you only have one chance to try the food of a lauded chef, you kinda want what they're famous for, even if it's expensive, because you're investing in an experience & a memory. But that's neither here nor there. Back to reality. Fulgurances Laundromat is a lively place that I really enjoy."

Ken F.,/user_details?userid=FtTfXyllyayV8oyN8tGtQQ,"Avondale Estates, GA",2/13/2022,5,"A review of this restaurant has to be more about the concept instead of the chef on any particular visit. And the concept is brilliant! An up and coming chef is invited here to show their skills for only a temporary several month stay. The setting is quintessential Brooklyn. The staff is regular and does not change. The service is great: relaxed and attentive. The wine pairing was fun and varied. And the food we had at our visit was great. We will be back with every new chef. It is like trying a new restaurant each time without having to search it out. We might be disappointed by the food at some point, but the anticipation and the possibility of discovery will always be there."
Amore P.,/user_details?userid=grXOo9SpWfNoJOWpBDVwQA,"Brooklyn, NY",8/12/2021,2,Food was bland. We waited about an hour between the first and second course. Service was fine. Meh.. not worth going.
Kaitlin W.,/user_details?userid=VzVfcYsgc0p2E8MY1QjlXw,"Brooklyn, NY",9/27/2021,5,"I'm so shocked by the negative reviews, especially regarding service. My husband and I visited a few weeks ago on a busy Saturday night. We had made a reservation, but because we were early, we sat at the counter instead. I'm so glad we did. The care that the staff takes with the food preparation was a wonder to watch. We did the tasting plus pairing and added the cheese course. Everything was fantastic and beautifully presented. I felt like I could have been in Paris but for the warmth of the staff and lack of insecurity at my nonexistent French. Also it is worth noting that the space is amazing - I can't believe I used to wash my sheets and towels in there.  I am so happy Fulgurances is in the neighborhood, and I can't wait to go back."
Monica M.,/user_details?userid=3LIyiEHGuQmhkZZVR1pJ_g,"Manhattan, NY",8/13/2021,5,"I've now eaten here about three times with different resident and guest chefs and am so looking forward to continuing to come to Fulgurances when new residents join.

The food was phenomenal and the service was amazing. I would say the black peppered beef, cauliflower lollipop, and rock shrimp blew it out of the water for me. We had the Chinese sausage fried rice and lobster fried rice which were both good and the rice noodles as well were okay. I would skip the mapo tofu- tasted like ketchup. The atmosphere is pretty dark, but the architecture is very unique- a great place to come for a birthday celebration and a more upscale date."

We made reservations for 11 o'clock and we did not have to wait to be seated. We ordered the oxtail dumplings. We also had the vegetable fried rice, the black pepper beef ( that name could be wrong), chicken, the chili shrimp and beef rib pancake and scallion. The veggie fried rice was different but it was good ( I'm not afraid to try new things ). I wasn't a big fan of the oxtail dumpling maybe if it was fried ( I didn't like the texture) the beef was good and it came in what looks like a basket, but the basket was edible it was made out of potatoes. The beef wasn't hot maybe they made it first and had it sitting . I'm not sure the name of the chicken but it was good , nice and juicy , I had the royal drink (wasnt nasty but just wasn't my taste ) will definitely be back"

Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted with a pleasant smile  from staff. We sat by the bar until our table was ready. I loved the ambiance it was very romantic and beautiful with an abundance of candle lit tables all around. We were seated in the main dining area aside from their grand table. This was our first time here other than their restaurant in Atlantic City which was quite a spectacular experience as well. Once again my palate was satisfied from their array of tasty delicacies. We enjoyed or dining there immensely. To top it off our wonderful  server offered us a free desert to commemorate our special day! Thanks Aya for making our day even more memorable.
Patricia J.,/user_details?userid=P8Chd7NCCvjcG5JgeN9Wbw,"New York, NY",11/27/2022,5,"It's got that dim lighting, minimal decoration but still breathtaking design. Had dinner here with a large group, and our server was very helpful in guiding us through the menu. Started off with the dim sum which was just the right amount and variation of everything. Everyone shared a few main dishes, and the Chinese sausage fried rice was definitely the standout dish. Everything, overall - food, vibe, drinks, and service was excellent. Definitely a good place to go to as a large group. This could easily be a good pick for a romantic and elegant date night as well."
Bijal R.,/user_details?userid=WioVCdMiLTzIc5qcANr5Gw,"New York, NY",2/21/2023,4,"Heard a lot about Buddakan, however it was overrated. Restaurant was HUGE as they are known for hosting large revenues for big events. Large, dim chandeliers light up the place, with unique paintings on the walls. We started with General Tso's Dumplings, which was the best part. They were flavorful although small in size. Rest of the dishes were mediocre as they did not seem authentic. The main dishes did not come with rice, so you have to order separately, otherwise the dishes were too dry and not filling. We ordered the Black Pepper Beef, served with a crispy bird's nest, which was sweet wok tossed rib eye pieces which were a bit dry and a little tough in texture. Another decent dish was the Ma La Chicken which has Szechuan peppercorns, chili and garnished with peanuts."

We first started with drinks at the bar, which were amazing! Then we headed to our table and had some appetizers (no pictures shown) but the lobster rolls are to die for. I would definitely have them every time I come here. We ordered the lamb chops and the broken chili chicken which were great but nothing spectacular. Next time I'll try the short rib service was amazing! Our server was lovely and prompt. The ambiance here is very cozy and romantic..perfect place for another date night!"

I definitely enjoyed the fix menu more, maybe because we got to try so many different things and they were all good. When we ordered separately I don't think we got the right things because nothing stood out. The ambience is great and I love the staircase, would definitely recommend for a nice dinner date or party. Our favorite was the edamame dumplings and mochi donuts."

Attentive, friendly and nice suggestions.  Friend arrives - she orders a particular martini ( Long Island women ) Jeff nails it and we move to the lower level, she survives the massive staircase while her drinks spills gingerly and discreetly..... maybe the hostess should have insisted on holding her drink.  greeted by our server who ( from Ecuador- (I like to ask where people are from) is friendly, patient and full of smiles. We order the dumpling sampler for two- DELISH! I avoid the red spicy dipping sauce cause I'm spicy as it is ! The Chardonnay is crisp and not as buttery as I like but it's icy cold. She orders a Martini with dry vermouth- in/out and no fruit.... Server delivers! The oxtail and duck dumplings were so filling as was the long conversations shared with my friend. Great spot- haven't been here in yearssss- as in Sex in the city years- but they're still fabulous and here for a reason. Will be back !"

The edamame dumplings stood out the most with the texture and flavor, a must try. It's worth trying but not a place I would return to when visiting the city."

The ambiance and decor was lovely. This was our first time here and we had a pleasant experience. The food was delicious, although I was not a fan of the General Tsos dumplings everything else was super flavorful. We didn't have to wait long for the food to come out. Our server Ashley was attentive and very kind! We will for sure be making a return to Buddakan!"
Alyssa V.,/user_details?userid=3i4_ZUuy2jZOalR-SjqSzQ,"North Arlington, NJ",9/28/2022,5,"I looooove this place. Do not leave without  getting their edamame dumplings. The aesthetic in here is absolutely gorgeous. It's feel like you're entering a different world. It is priced as a city restaurant with be, but not overboard. I can't wait to go back!"
Ore O.,/user_details?userid=jfCmUqSdKF7xrEMK861-xg,"Wanneperveen, The Netherlands",3/16/2023,4,The rice choices were good! I got the sausage fried rice as well as the oxtail dumpling's and they were both delicious. The restaurant had a nice ambiance but was too dark.
Sherilyn N.,/user_details?userid=HiVyr-EMxcv-kVDMiOa2Rg,"Union City, NJ",8/2/2022,4,The atmosphere here is very lux and elegant. We arrived for dinner on a saturday night. We had to wait despite our reservations but the waiting bar area was nice and you could order drinks to get you started which we all did and enjoyed. Once seated we didn't get to see the bottom floor which has more of an open floor space we sat on the top which was more secluded. We loved the drinks so much we ordered them again at the table but they were not the same and were super sweet. The manager offered making us a new batch and it still wasn't as good as the bar area but it was a nice gesture. The entree were tasty but the apps were amazing. The yellowtail sashimi was my favorite.

The edamame dumplings were amazing- like a bunch of cream wrapped up in a cloud. Mapo tofu was delicious, with sichuan peppers to give a slight tingling sensation to the palate. The chocolate lava dessert with coffee ice cream is absolutely spectacular so definitely keep some room for dessert"
Brianna T.,/user_details?userid=0TWSZ-wpK1wFxpWF0zhEPw,"Queens, Queens, NY",8/5/2022,5,"I stumbled upon here while visiting the Little Island. You need reservations but the people were nice enough to let us sit outside because we did not have one, thank you guys! They also let us pick our seating which was appreciated. I ordered the Frozen which came with a lychee, the drink was nice & fruity & the alcohol taste wasn't too strong. We also got the vegetable fried rice with coconut curry & the crispy fried tofu I believe! it was all so good I absolutely want to come back here with my loved ones so they can have the same 5 star experience that I did. I left with extra food& as I'm eating now as I write this review it is still very good! Thank you guys so much for my wonderful dinner yesterday & making my evening feel special!"

When i can't stay in I'll take them to go. I was so disappointed i didn't have my jalapeños in my Togo package may seem small but they flavors so really do come together so well. I'll still go back i just have to make sure i have everything before i leave. I'm back in Philly and i don't want to go to the store for any peppers

Super super fast service and got all the orders correct. Pork potstickers were really good and crispy! The noodles were so good and the sauce was too, slightly salty but it was good! The vegetable fried rice was so good, at first I was surprised to see rice as white! It was soooo good! The chicken was sweet and crispy! The spicy shrimp was good and as soon as you bit into it, it was the perfect crunch factor. The tofu was delicious. Best I've ever ever had! So good and great portions! We split each meal between all 4 of us and it was perfect. And for dessert, we had the pistachio ice cream and it was divine! Such a great restaurant."
Becca H.,/user_details?userid=6oO8BTi_wpTckeTRF02XjQ,"Orlando, FL",3/10/2023,5,"I've heard of buddakan plenty of times and knew it was somewhere I wanted to eat at during my trip to New York. I was a little hesitant as is always the case with well known restaurants with hefty prices: is it just the cool ambiance or is the food actually worth it? Well I am happy to say the food was delicious and it was definitely worth it! Half of my table wanted to try the chef's tasting menu for $90. At first our waitress denied our request by saying the full table has to order the tasting. However, she quickly accommodated and let us rearrange ourselves so the five were all seated together. This tasting consists of 5 appetizers: edamame dumplings, general Tso dumplings, Peking duck salad, chicken and shrimp egg rolls, and salmon dumplings. Everything was portioned so that each person could get one serving, however it was definitely enough. My favorites were the salad for its fresh acidity, the egg rolls for the savory flavors of the meats, and the general Tso dumplings for the delicious broth that oozed out. For the entrees, we got a black pepper beef, cod, chicken, crispy shrimp, vegetable fried rice, and mixed veggies. The standouts for me were the beef, chicken, and rice. The rice was so unique and delicious, it came with this coconut cream that complimented together so well. Two desserts were brought out to finish off the meal and I got my own dessert to celebrate my bachelorette, I thought this was a sweet touch. The desserts were nothing that stood out but by the end of this meal, you're stuffed. I think the tasting was a great way to sample a large and slightly overwhelming menu and now I can positively say I would be back again!"

We ordered lobster fried rice, shrimp Lo Mein, spicy shrimp, and lobster rolls. The appetizer were good the spicy shrimp and lobster rolls but the entrees horrendous. The lobster fried rice was yellow rice from a box. The Lomein at a local Chinese restaurant was better than the one from Buddakan. The service was awesome. The ambience was chill. If you visit only have the appetizers."

They have a lounge area where you can order drinks while you wait for your table to be ready. The waiters were attentive and friendly. But the star of the show has to be the tuna tartare spring rolls. Oh my god. So so good. Must order! The noodle servings were big. The black pepper chicken was good but not special. The charred broccoli had great flavor but I was hoping for a bit more char. I'd definitely come back. The servings are all shareable.
Kelsi Y.,/user_details?userid=eV5HpTY84zJYuCB_sv2Akg,"Jersey City, NJ",12/4/2022,4,"The internal ambience is pretty good.

Sandy Y.,/user_details?userid=Ljnp0sSHaGmj9fnxcnBmAA,"New York, NY",12/2/2022,4,"This place is great as a vibe but it is TRULY a fusion spot. It is not authentic and you should not expect it to be. It was still delicious and a little bit better than some other bougie asian fusion spots in the area. The best thing I tried was FOR SURE the general tso dumplings, eggpant+tofu, and the passionfruit dessert."

Here we go...took my family out for dinner for my daughter's birthday and let me say in one word....AMAZING! First of all, the level of attention placed in the customer experience was extraordinary to me. We choose to go with the Tasting Menu IV which gave us the ultimate tasting experience with a 4-course meal. I would highly recommend this especially if it's your first time and with a group.. Our server, Shanna, was extremely attentive to our every needs. The appetizer were a great starter...leading to the other dishes and one after the other it was more and more amazing. Everything was well seasoned and perfect to the taste. The dessert was another show stopper especially the cheesecake. The pictures taken do not even do the food just but just trust me Buddhakan does not disappoint. Great experience!"

This is basically mediocre Chinese food being served in a two story wood paneled faux hotel lobby, complete with snooty front desk hostesses mourning in all black. Fortunately it's dark enough to miss the ill placed billboard sized Renaissance art. Bring your night vision goggles as you'll need them to see your potstickers and fried rice. You won't see any real celebrities here but you'll catch plenty of gullible tourists and likely a few ""influencers""."

It is 4 $$$$ sign, but I think this place is more of $$$ in my opinion. The price for 3 came out to be around 150-160 + tip, which is not too bad.

I am such a dumpling person and there variety of dumplings have to be by far the most unique and most delicious dumplings I have ever tasted in my life! I would never think to order an edamame dumpling but someone at our table was vegetarian and ordered it I was in shock. That dumpling was the most delicious flavorful dumpling I have ever had in my life and each dish that came out was just better then the next! Luckily we were there with a few people so we were able to taste almost everything. My top favorite was the General Tso's Dumpling, the Oxtail Dumpling (still drooling) , and the Ducks in a row were insane! You can't go wrong with any of the dishes it was just all amazing! I wish I lived in New York just so I can eat here whenever I want I would literally book a flight to New York just to eat these dumplings! If you haven't tried this place RUN."

Paige M.,/user_details?userid=m5EzgirIlpaTNIofgB43Gw,"University District, Columbus, OH",3/6/2023,3,"A group of 6 of us came for dinner for my friend's 24th birthday. We had reservations for about 3 weeks prior and we wrote in the reservation a request for the long table and that it was her birthday. We didn't get the long table, not a problem we got seated at a 6 person and it was fine. The appetizers were really good, especially the pork buns. However, at 8:40, only an hour into our reservation a man in a suit with a headset (the manager? The bouncer?) came over and told us we ""had enough time"" and we had to give up the table. At that point we'd been waiting 20 minutes for the birthday dessert to come out. With the speed of the other food, we were already kind of surprised at how long it was taking for the dessert, as if the waiter forgot about us. Then, we told the guy in the suit we'd only been there an hour and it was a birthday celebration he stuttered like he didn't expect us to talk back and left. He came back like 10 minutes later and apologized and gave us ""free dessert for the whole table"" but they left off one of the desserts we ordered and only gave us 3 and we still waited over 20 minutes for the dessert (40 minute wait for dessert after food). The floating matcha dessert was alright but not as good as the rest of the food. (If you have a texture problem don't get it, get the lava cake) If I went back it would have to be like carry out or something because saying ""you've had enough time"" came off like he was pushing us around because we're all girls in our 20's."

Arya S.,/user_details?userid=ExecxB1BsOfPmap7wqfMGw,"Los Angeles, CA",6/1/2022,2,"Here's the thing: I don't like making businesses look bad for external problems but my reason for 2 stars is beyond that. The service was very nice - which is why they earn a couple of stars. However, the food was average. For a place this pricey and fancy, I expect better taste. Additionally, my friends and I got the corner booth at this beautiful restaurant and halfway through our meal, a mouse ran down the corner of the wall 2 feet away from my friends head. The manager comped *some* of our meal, offered free dessert and to seat us somewhere else. But the damage was done. Why would we wanna continue sitting at this restaurant? So, overall, my review takes several factors into consideration. Will not be going back any time soon."
Rajashree D.,/user_details?userid=WYogoM9Mor9J2HuvO-mAdg,"San Francisco, CA",8/28/2022,4,What a place!!!!! You wouldn't even know there is this whole world of buddakan from outside the door. It has this whole dark themed cozy vibes. Food and service was top notch... the drinks too!! Definitely get the woke tossed shrimp noodles! It was the best. Just taking out one point because the shrimp toast was really oil and chewy

Silvia S.,/user_details?userid=xVe9YUp5-SrdOMdFr89FCg,"San Francisco, CA",12/22/2022,3,"Not the best. I think its more like a club than a ""Restaurant"" for me was too loud and noisy (nice music but wow) then the lights in a candle style lol.. it was ok but to read the menu etc was kinda forced. Food could be better and its not a family friendly restaurant so if you go with babies wont have where to change them in the restroom. (Christmas season apparently they accepts kids but keep that in mind) and stairs everywhere! ‍"

My friends noddles was good, lamb chops was decent, pork buns were good, the chili rock shrimp was ok, the sweet and crispy jumbo shrimp was a hit. It was a decent experience."

Marie P.,/user_details?userid=H5blOs5QvDv_ga591li3zQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2/12/2023,1,"This was the absolute Worst!!!experience I had along with my family all because of a pompous, prejudice disgusting character of the staff especially the Waitress!!!  I along with my colleague , my daughter, her best friend and her boyfriend attended. We were celebrating my daughter's 19 birthday. My colleague, I and my daughters best friend walked into the restaurant first. We were nicely greeted by the women up front. We were then seated in the lounge/waiting area. We were waiting for my daughter and her boyfriend to park their car at a nearby  parking garage/designated area. (Side note: I have worked In the Chelsea area for many years and have frequented most of the restaurants in the area and have always been treated with respect and good customer service) a waitress with golden blonde hair asked my  friend and I if we would like to order a cocktail while waiting.  So we decided , why not have a cocktail. They presented us with the menu and i ordered the blush a lychee drink and my friend a drink named Vigor which she didn't like lol but drank it anyway. Way too pricey $20 subpar cocktails.. I've had Lychee cocktails that were top notch for less. Anyways my daughter and her bf came in and I told the waitress to have them seated while I pay my tab at the bar. I gave them My varo card which I use everyday every where even restaurants and receive my direct deposits from work . I keep my other bank and credit cards at home for other purposes . The tab was closed out by the waitress and I also included a tip . I audacity to treat us horribly and I was just trying to have a nice birthday dinner for my daughter and her friends.. it's sad. The food is mediocre ...trust that you can find better Asian fusion elsewhere . The lighting is so bad !!too dark in many areas the restaurant."

This place was like walking into a whole different world. The ambiance is incredible. It's an experience in and of itself. I love the cauliflower lollipops they were soft and melted in your mouth-- although I felt there could have been a bit more flavor or sauce with the lollipops. They were also incredibly hot when you bite into them. The smoked salmon dumplings were very flavorful and the sauce complimented the crunchiness nicely. The chili rock shrimp was okay... it wasn't too spicy and wasn't particularly memorable. The hit of the night was the Chinese sausage fried rice. You need to order this... there was soft yolk, a lot of seasoning, small cut sausage all delicately mixed. I would go back even though it's a bit pricey"

The server wasn't to bad, but for the amount of money I had to spend and to leave all of what we ordered. Shows that we left and wasn't please with what we ordered. We left hungry. I ended up having to take them to get something to eat afterwards. Which is a shame. The pics are inserted. Looks can be deceiving."

The lamb was very tender and the chicken was perfect with the chili glaze. Definitely recommend this place for someone who wants fine dining Asian cuisine"

Just not worth the money. The edamame dumpling tasted great but had a dry texture. The kimchi rice was surprisingly tasteless. The spare tub and the chili shrimp were good. The cauliflower lollipop was... sweet? My daughter wanted great ambience and food. She got 1/2.

Ambiance blows you away at check in, passing the bar, and walking to your table with the grand chandelier. The vibe is intimate, trendy dark, with fun music. To start we got the shrimp dumplings and rock shrimp. Very strong starters, both easy reorders. As for the main, the black cod was melt in your mouth amazingness. The lobster fried rice was good... but based on the other reviews I was expecting more.  Didn't really taste the saffron which even the server sold the dish on (I was contemplating the crab sticky rice). Mango sorbet was a nice sweet finish. The drinks are expertly crafted and glassed. I'd definitely return again."

We chose the $90 option. Wow, everything was absolutely delicious and the portion sizes were great! I just really wish they spaced the food out because it was too much all at once and we were getting way too full. They should give people some time between the courses.  Ordering from the tasting menu was worth it though."

Gina A.,/user_details?userid=zbaY8nqiXFoAqqXjYSQjbQ,"Manhattan, NY",3/20/2022,4,Exceptional food. Sincerely five star cuisine. The portions are vert generous. Ambience is breathtaking. But the music is DEAFENING. I get that they're going for a vibe but the decibel level of the music is beyond swanky restaurant loud...it's painfully loud. We had to scream at each other during our entire meal and many sentences had to be repeated. It's such a shame because it really made the meal a lot less enjoyable. I can't imagine anyone enjoying music that loud while trying to eat dinner and talk with others. If you are dreading having to socialize with people this is your place--don't worry--having a conversation is pretty much off the table. But if you do want to come here and actually enjoy the company you come with it'll be nearly impossible.

They sat us right by the speakers. I get they wanna make use of all their space but to have a table right by speakers is a little insensitive. We didn't sit at the long table in the pictures with the chandeliers... I think they were hosting a party or maybe you have to be special enough to sit there...Idk, the pictures either way are deceiving. The food was so so. I had oxtail dumplings which were extremely meaty, like you have to chew and chew and chew. Smoked salmon dumplings which were actually amazing. Vegetable fried rice that was literally a big bowl of sticky white rice and what looked like cilantro. Also ordered shrimp which we never received. By the time I realized, I was tired and ready to go. Again, it was busy, but our server was nowhere to be found half the time. The dessert in the pic was good. I wanna give this place one more chance seeing how I did go on a Friday night. Maybe I'll try again on a Tuesday night and I'll actually get to sit at the table in the pictures as advertised lmao"

It was a little tough to find as the restaurant sign is blended in with the wall but it's a whole new world once you enter. The ambiance is very upscale and beautiful. The food was fantastic and they have a few vegetarian and vegan options as well. My favorite thing was edamame dumplings. The waitress was actually very rude and laughed at my friend who wanted to split the bill with someone else but besides that everything was great!

It was like they were waiting for us to buy something at the bar before we were seated which was weird. I asked the hostess if it would be a long wait and she said no. I noticed that people who arrived after us who got drinks at the bar were seated before us. We were finally seated at a table downstairs which was about 6 inches next to the tables on either side of us making it a really tight fit. We asked the server for recommendations and he wasn't very helpful stating everything was good. Overall portions were small to average, expensive and the food was just ok. The level of snootiness in this establishment is HIGH and definitely not our style at all. The women's bathroom is so dark you cannot even see to put on lipstick. We came here at the recommendation of several people but were disappointed in the overall experience for the price. Way too expensive for the level of service and food received."

It looks intimidating at first with all the huge doors to enter but once you're in there the service is great and the food is delicious! We love the ambience! That's what we usually go for each time! The mala chicken was delicious! Most of their appetizers I've had are pretty good. The jade shrimp dumplings are a great choice! Wasn't a big fan of their lobster fried rice. It was bland. The lobster to rice ratio wasn't great either. So it's just a pricey dish which didn't hit the mark.

Their wine list is strictly ok esp. considering the price but they have some great cocktails. Pls do not miss a chance to go to Buddakan.

Food was good to we loved the oxtail dumplings, black pepper beef, sausage fried rice, great cocktails as well. One of the chicken dishes ma La chicken was bland and not seasoned enough but overall great selection of food I definitely recommend the oxtail dumplings it was so unique and executed flawlessly"

Elizabeth K.,/user_details?userid=7x1zpCkPPw2SyTs7-TV_fg,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1/6/2023,5,I spent my 20th birthday at Buddakan and it was wonderful. The service is great and the food was delicious. I loved the many rooms that they had it's a little dark and romantic there. Such a beautiful place I loved it.
Elizabeth H.,/user_details?userid=iD1HVzwy1iwR0jpZEd7qqQ,"Manhattan, NY",12/24/2021,3,"Amazing restaurant I've been coming to for 15 years+, so thought it was a great place to celebrate my 40th Birthday w friends.  As always, ambience and food were great, but our main waiter, Bryan, was one of the worst I've had anywhere in NYC.  Not only did he have a perma-frown on his face, viewable from his drooping mask, but he gave no special attention to the fact that it was my birthday, often leaving me without a drink, was rude to every guest (running off before we could ever complete an order), argued over being able to bring items I've ordered for years, and even told us the shots my friend in LA had arranged for us were from a manager - WOW!  Let's not even discuss the sad Birthday ""treat"" he sent over (see picture)...This man should be fired immediately so the rating can resume its normal 5 star service."

Shurovi P.,/user_details?userid=anwb9b1XMP-r6_He1Nf-ug,"Long Island, NY",6/24/2021,4,Beautiful place and décor. My favorite was the chili rock shrimp. The drinks are very nice too. Celebrated a friends birthday here and had a great time. Would definitely recommend eating here.

Amanda S.,/user_details?userid=sTW0gS1reTlPhrZYCDKH7A,"Daly City, CA",5/16/2022,3,"This spot is so beautiful inside with the high ceilings and decor. It's an upscale Asian fusion restaurant that requires rsvp. We had a party of 8 for dinner and the table we sat on was the communal one. My favorite dish was surprisingly the gai lan veggies with truffle flavor, the combo was delicious. We had the short ribs chow fun, spicy rock shrimp, crab fried rice, and drinks. Everything was a bit too salty for my palette but the fried rice was on the blander end so we asked for hot sauce. Their chili oil was spicy but a good kick to the rice dish. I also had the Relfection which is a non-alcoholic beverage. It was delicious and refreshing. Meal was $462 for 8 people where we ordered a light meal since we weren't hungry from an earlier meal. It wasn't bad for the cost but the food didn't wow me nor do I think it is worth the four dollar signs for Chinese food. Worth trying and see the cute space, but the food could have been better."
Sage L.,/user_details?userid=uF4Y4sDWAL5spETNWvi6hw,"GA, GA",3/25/2022,5,We chose the $80 course menu and it was amazing! It had a total of three courses and it ends with desert.

The food was tasty, good size portions, fresh and flavorful. We had the edamame dumplings, oxtail dumplings, general tao dumplings to start. Party also enjoyed the rock shrimp, lamp chops, garlic chicken, veggie fried rice and steak. Everything was good. We recommend an early dinner."

Out of al of the things we've ordered, I'd say that the oxtail dumplings and the ribs were my my favorite. The lobster fried rice lacked in flavor but the server brought us sweet chili sauce and it was better. To be honest, I kind of hated the crispy jumbo shrimp. It also lacked in flavor and the sauce just wasn't for me. Lastly, we also ordered the banana cheesecake. SO GOOD!!' Overall it was a decent experience, I'd recommend for light bites and a girls night"

Definitely would return on a special occasion.

Our server was truly awesome, she gave recs and described our dishes in poetic detail. We had the pork steam buns, chili chicken and veggie fried rice, plus the shaved ice dessert.

I'm still dreaming about the crab sticky rice and lobster fried rice I had. The drinks were also good and refreshing. Not too sweet. They also made me a drink that was not on the menu, which made me happy. This is definitely fine dining. The restaurant is pricy but for the quality of food it's worth it. You will love the ambiance, so dress nicely so you can snag some great pics. Parking is difficult in the area so I would suggest taking public transportation."

Started out with the edamame dumplings (of course), chili rock shrimp, and Cantonese spring rolls. We then moved on to the prawn noodles with lobster egg rolls. Rounded it out with chocolate pistachio cremoso dessert, which was as delicious as the entrees. My favorites were the edamame dumplings & noodles. Also got frozen blush to drink -- very refreshing & seemed to have good alcohol content. Hope to go back again!!"

Food is very ornery and not authentic Chinese food at all. Chili Chicken was basically  sliced chicken tenders with store-bought quality sweet chili sauce on the side. Dumplings were fine but the lamb chops were tiny and undercooked with no discernible spices or garnishing. The whiskey sour cocktail tasted like a soft drink with minimal alcohol (or whiskey) in the mix. If not for the incredible venue and the very well dressed clientele, the place wouldn't stand up to competition from any reasonable Chinese takeout place. Wine was v expensive too. Bill was about $400 for a light meal for 2 - not worth it at all unless all you care about is the ambience and service. Place was packed on a weekday evening- so some people definitely like what they are getting."

We ordered chicken dimsums, carrot dimsums crispy fried cauliflower. Cauliflower snack is a must try, so different than any other cauliflower app i ever tried. Even carrot dimsums were amazing. We got crispy tofu in main course and that was fantastic all these were suggested by our server, and was so good. We ordered 2 desserts and both were really good. Will definitely be visiting again"

The lighting and music and decor is top notch. Some of the Asian food is overpriced and I can find better tasting dishes in Chinatown but worth coming here for the vibe. The drinks were very good
Peppa P.,/user_details?userid=ZUyHMLgRaOP_SakpkczCkg,"Brooklyn, NY",12/10/2021,3,"I'd say this place is great to grab drinks and socialize but as far as food goes I'd eat dinner first and then grab drinks there afterwards. I hope you like your drink strong because it seems the bartenders are better at pouring than mixing a good cocktail. But I'm a bit of a drinks snob especially when paying top dollar for it. The food is missing good authentic flavor and maybe even some love, and for all that to be overpriced, Id just say- I am not impressed! The managerial staff  were extremely accommodating and friendly. Our waiter and bartender, came off short, snobbish and cold almost like they have no patience, not even for questions or issues! I'll probably not go back here for dinner but I may try it during happy hour again! The ambiance and decor was very nice!"

Peking duck for 2 is great, steamed fish was great, the Cauliflower pops was surprisingly good. How they do that to cauliflower? Fried rice was also very good."

Atty F.,/user_details?userid=G2nCqd92y4Mot1mEu-XFPQ,"Midwood, Brooklyn, NY",4/18/2022,5,"We had been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time and finally made it to celebrate my birthday. The decor is beautiful and food amazing. It is rare that one goes to a restaurant and loves every single dish. We stuck to small dishes and boy did we have quite a few (some even twice). Favorites were the oxtail dumplings, short rib scallion pancakes, tuna tartare spring rolls and rock shrimp. The portions are decent and the prices, considering, quite reasonable. My only remark is that I expected this to be more of a high end restaurant. My husband and I dressed up but many of the patrons were in sweats or jeans and running sneakers. I miss the days where people dressed out to dine and it was enforced. It really brought the experience down a bit for me but I guess in this day and age, there's not much one can do. When desert arrived, they had placed a happy birthday chocolate with a candle which arrived by someone other than our server, Ashley,  which was surprising. I would think that she would've brought it over herself ( another disappointing moment). Overall a wonderful experience but not quite to the standard that I had expected."
Sid M.,/user_details?userid=knrupsullzWNqkUzGHshpQ,"Baltimore, MD",4/27/2022,4,"I had a really good experience here. The ambiance and the lighting is really good. Our waiter was very nice and well mannered and gave good recommendations. We got the sampler appetizer plate where we could try a little bit of each, although it did not include the lobster egg rolls (which are supposedly really good here, maybe will try that instead next time). Overall, I was not super impressed with the appetizers but they were still good. For the entree, the noodles were really good and the chili chicken was tender and sweet and spicy. Also, the tofu was really good. I would recommend this place and hope to get the big table next time. I recommend reserving in advance."
Udochi O.,/user_details?userid=yDlz9hLhP7xKB2zxBhuEXw,"McLean, VA",12/8/2021,4,Extremely beautiful restaurants. Gave me sexy ambiance vibes. Came here with my husband after the Brooklyn nets game for dinner. We were seated upstairs so I didn't get to sit in the amazing dining room with the lighted candles but I still loved the vibe. For appetizers we had the oxtail dumplings which were amazing. Very unique starter of choice. For dinner I had lamb chops and coconut rice and my husband had the peppered beef. I'm sure it's not authentic Chinese food but the food was really really good and it was nice to get a different experience I wouldn't be able to have in the DC area. Hoping to return again for my anniversary.
Anna C.,/user_details?userid=Bb-b8LPUTRvKG5_mVUpw5Q,"Fayetteville, NC",10/4/2021,5,This place is unbelievable! I cannot wait to return. The decor is some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. The quality of the food is some of the most delicious and expertly prepared I've EVER had.

The first time we felt this way as a couple. This time our group commented about the exact same thing. It sort of feels like despite the fun, relaxing vibe that the service is focused on rushing through the meals. I would definitely recommend for the menu, but maybe not for the experience."

From the moment you walk in the vibe is exactly what you want it to be. Then....there's the food. My friend and I were excited to try and had some time to kill before our reservation so we had a few apps at a place down the street. So when we ordered our actual food from Buddakan we were fairly unamused by the quality. The noodles were average, duck was somewhat dry, and the dessert was burnt. Maybe it was a bad night, maybe it was just overly hyped. Either way, I wouldn't rush to go back."

I was sitting in the area bcas they had no availability in the restaurant, she went out of her way to offer us a table once they had a cancellation. That's why I gave them 4 stars, the food is 3."

Ashley V.,/user_details?userid=dcagv6WcN6elJOODuYaCRg,"London, United Kingdom",3/22/2022,5,Super good service & food. I like the tuna tartare roll & dumpling sampler/tower. Great restaurant to celebrate a special occasion!

The staff from the front of house were pleasant, helpful and maintained eye contact, the manager Mark, was also a delight. Paula our server was just wonderful, engaging and informative. Cocktails were great, food- extra phenomenal. I had the whole applewood smoked sea bass (YUM) and my date had the Kung pao monkfish which was also very tasty. For starters where the Peking Duck salad and the northern pacific oysters. Each and every plate a welcome surprise."
Stefanie M.,/user_details?userid=B9NLsaJ_0Cq2M9_GjbScJQ,"Suffern, NY",5/16/2021,5,"First time here and an absolutley amazing ambiance and vibe. We had an early dinner reservation for 4pm and were one of the first seated in the upper dining area. I wasn't sure what the differences were between bar seats/table reservations but, once you visit you will see that the main dining area with the infamous steps and chandeliers is the lower level. The menu has to be scanned via smartphone/QR Code and we were reminded that we had 2 hours to enjoy our meal. Food was made to order and very delicious, we didn't feel rushed either. Looking forward to trying other menu items here. I reccomend the crispy cauliflower lollipops, general tso's dumpling, hot chili rock shrimp, and the charred filet (beef)."
Cassidy R.,/user_details?userid=fCicfFUuwx7pemE4ddoIxQ,"Brooklyn, NY",7/1/2021,5,"This place is amazing!!! I came here last week for my boyfriends 25th birthday. The ambiance is wonderful, the food is great and the drinks are so good. Our waitress was super sweet and attentive (I wish I would've caught her name). For drinks we ordered the Answer and it was really good. Mine was a little sour at first but it went away the more I drank. We ordered the chili rock shrimp and the general tsos dumplings. Both were great. The general tsos comes super hot so be careful! For dinner we ordered the lobster fried rice, the charred filet of beef and the sweet and crispy jumbo shrimp. Everything was cooked perfectly. My boyfriends birthday was amazing and our first time at Buddakan was great. Can't wait to come back"

Oxtail dumplings, carrot dumplings, short rib and scallion pancakes, roasted chicken congee, tai shan cauliflower, vegetable rice, and a nice glass of the cab were all excellent, delicious, and I would highly recommend them all, knowing you can trust anything on the menu. Our waiter was also excellent, informative, responsive and personable. The only issue was on our arrival and this is a note to anyone over 55 (maybe even 45): the phalanx of skinny girls looking past you with soulless eyes at the reception desk will try to seat you in the bar area or hide you in the corner of the back room of the back room based on your age. So be prepared to ask for what you want."

Simone W.,/user_details?userid=JueqjJsKEaWsivh7nQftdg,"Peekskill, NY",1/23/2022,4,"Went to Buddakan yesterday for my birthday. Everything was so good. The restaurant has a dark and intimate feel. The service was great. I recommend making reservations ahead of time which we did,  our wait time was less than 5 min. The General Tso dumplings were so good as were the steamed sole and the crab sticky fried rice. The drinks were typical but not bad. The food is a little pricey but worth it. I'd recommend and will likely be back. Sorry too busy eating to take pics"

Even with a reservation the wait was about 45 minutes, but eventually we got seated. The lighting was dark for my liking, but the decor is beautiful. Not much of a fan of Asian cuisine, but I wasn't the birthday girl. I was looking through the menu for something familiar, and there it was. Jumbo shrimp, and not much of else. How do I finish all my meals? With something sweet, of course! Banana cheesecake, maple ice cream, spice cookie, bourbon. Now that my fellow Yelpers hit all the right sweet spots and then some."

The restaurant is absolutely stunning, decorated ornately with East Asian art and sculptures. The main dining room is breathtaking, and the lounge area is very classy. All that being said, this restaurant is for no casual occasion for the average diner. Dishes are very expensive, but certainly worth the price. I highly recommend the peppered beef and sausage fried rice."

Their cocktails are great with their blush pink lychee martini being my fav."

My sister and her fiancé brought my mother and I here while we were in town and my mother was not pleased about how long we waited. Our reservation was for 9pm but we were not seated till after 10pm. My mother doesn't even like to stay out that late and we were all hungry from a long day. My sisters fiancé also felt really bad for bringing his future mother in law there. I tried to cheer him up and let him know this was out of his control. All that for subpar food. Smh."

Jenny P.,/user_details?userid=mQQOu0qTdA-b6IglEXhCMw,"Deptford Township, NJ",10/17/2022,1,"Wow...if I could give ZERO stars I would. No appreciation for our business or money. The whole vibe is snooty and dark and loud blaring music no class. The server was not attentive and initially charged a $4.50 soda that we didn't want because we didn't want ginger ale. He also didn't take it off our bill until we pointed it out and pointed it out to remove it. The portion sizes are completely disproportionate and completely exorbitant for what they charge. They say it's family style but their portion sizes make it for a family of 1.5. Their dumpling skins were too thick and some parts were too touch and inedible. The wild mushroom chow fun was overly salty. I would NEVER return for the lack of value. Also I mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary and NO ONE EVEN BATTED AN EYE NO MENTION NOTHING. It's like ""Be glad you can say you ate here"" vibe and it rubbed us the wrong way. We will never return and spend our money here. We will make sure we tell our friends NOT to go here."

Kamila K.,/user_details?userid=PBDyg__dQFiZD1DKfa5lXw,"Brooklyn, NY",10/31/2020,5,"Been here for my birthday twice and absolutely in LOVE! I crave Buddakan 24/7 lol. Their chili rock shrimp HITS the spot. We also had the pork buns which we loved. The Ma La chicken, I could eat every day. Chinese sausage fried rice and Wok tossed noodles with prawns was excellent. The staff/service is impeccable. They answered all of our questions and were very attentive. Constantly coming over to remove dirty napkins and replacing them and filling our drinks. Sit indoors. The decor is elegant, yet edgy. Downstairs feels like Game of Thrones. Of course it's on the ""pricier side"" but the flavor of the food is absolutely worth it! I need to go on more date nights to Buddakan!!"

Denise P.,/user_details?userid=5p5jGVdyYgzzQOS74hN-xw,"Brooklyn, NY",9/7/2021,4,"I honestly was surprised at how much I liked Buddakan.  Honestly, I never thought I'd even come to this place, which I always assumed was for tourists and people who just wanted to be seen.  However, we were looking for a place to eat prior to a show at City Winery and walked past their outdoor dining area, which looked so inviting that we decided to give Buddakan a go.  The servers were great and extremely helpful, because we decided to try a bunch of small plates and didn't know how much to order, and we ended up with the perfect amount of food.  Cocktails were interesting and delicious, and honestly I was surprised how much I liked the food.  We tried the lobster egg rolls, which were a little bland but loaded with lobster; the oxtail dumplings, which were delicious; the pea shoot salad, which was crunchy and fantastic; and the pork buns, which were good.  With each item in the $17-18 range, it wasn't a cheap meal, but the portions were decent and the presentation was lovely.  I definitely would eat here again before a CW show (frankly, it's not that much more expensive than dinner there and the food was a heck of a lot better)."

Leo Y.,/user_details?userid=SF7cQfmHuQWqINKruCe-kA,"Albany, NY",7/4/2021,5,"This was a unique restaurant experience. When we first walked up, we thought it was a club, based on the employee dress code, the bouncer out front, and the lights and music pulsing from the door. Walking in, there were about a dozen employees behind a front desk, that looked like they were in a fashion magazine shoot. We were checked in by one of the employees, and walked to our table, when over the next several hours, an our waiter, and numerous employees checked in on us, and brought us food and drinks. The star was the edamame dumplings. Biting into a happy cloud is the only way I can think of describing what it feels like to eat one. Everything else was roughly as I would expect from a restaurant costing $100, per person, for dinner. Everything was cooked perfectly, plated beautifully, and the service was spot on. I'm not sure how often we would come back here, but the edamame dumplings sure make it tempting to return."

Their food is top notch, we tried almost everything because we decided to go with the tasting menu (highly recommend) WHAT an experience- lobster fried rice, black pepper beef, edamame dumpling, spring  rolls, broken chili chicken and chili rock shrimp were all my favorites. Everything was just soooooo good! The service is impeccable, our waiter Ryan really knew their menu and made some great recommendations! And DO NOT skip the desserts!"

Once I got to my table, everything from the service to food was amazing! I started off with the Chilli rock sushi and the oxtail dumplings. I usually don't like dumplings but the waitress recommended this specific one and I'm so glad I tried it. The dumpling had a thin outer layer which made the meat so flavorful. I had the beef filet and lobster rice as my entree which was also very delicious. Ended my meal with the double chocolate monkey bread and crying chocolate which was good but not the best dessert I've had. I'd definitely come back for the ambiance and food."

The food was delicious, my friends ordered various sushi dishes which all looked so beautiful but I did not try, none the less they seemed to enjoy them! I can, however, vouch for their bang bang shrimp, it was scrumptious! And for my main course I had their chicken which was yummy and of course last but not least the main course: desert. I tried so many different deserts that night with my friends, I forget the names but each one was a major hit with me, it was very much what my taste buds needed that night."
Betty W.,/user_details?userid=QgQeoCWmzLjTJW1cZdIvvw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/21/2021,5,Consistently excellent and attentive service each time I've been here. The food is next level.

I dream about these pillows of heaven and make it my first stop whenever I return to the city. All the food is delicious, the restaurant is impossibly chic (which makes for quite the price tag), but I almost always enjoy the dim sum the best. The soup dumplings were delicious as are the rock shrimp. We ordered the Lobster Egg rolls, which are great for sharing since they are very large but weren't special. The drinks however are. Ask for a lychee martini, which isn't on the menu but worth steering off course. The restaurant can be incredibly loud, but it's great for a celebration and the people watching never disappoints."

They need to play more diverse music but other than that the vibe was nice. We ordered a bunch of different things as this is ""family style"" the portion sizes are not really family style to me it was more for two people. The lobster rice was good. The shrimp they have for on the appetizer menu was good! There was this cauliflower that was also amazing."

The scallion pancake, cauliflower lollipops, and veggie stir fry had absolutely no flavor. The stir fry was simply sautéed vegetables. There was no taste aside from oil. Instead of rectifying the issue, the manager blamed the situation on us and our dietary habits (I happen to be vegetarian). TL;DR...go for the ambiance; otherwise, the food SUCKS"

You mostly pay to the name and decor. Wouldn't really recommend if your looking for five star meal. If you are looking for a place to get good pictures and drinks then this place works.

(This will be the only time we are here.). We sat outside for lunch.

The restaurant is so beautiful, we couldn't get over every little detail. We were 9 people so did order a lot of food, but each thing was better and better. The dumplings are unreal. My favorite were the edamame ones. Still dreaming about them. And the cauliflower lollipops were amazing, the tuna tartare spring rolls was one of my favs . Another great thing is although there are so many options on the menu it's not extensive. They have about 4 options for each category so we ordered almost all of them to share. There was not one thing we didn't like on the menu. HIGHLY recommend this place and I am eager to go back."

Everything was extremely sweet like the broken chilli chicken which is supposed to be spicy. The cod was okay but also somewhat overly sweet. I wouldn't recommend going here when there are so many other Chinese food options in the city.

Angela L.,/user_details?userid=kbRJKTbTXir3uK_Ipx8Wzw,"Manhattan, NY",1/28/2020,4,"I was looking for a place for my 3 years anniversary dinner with my boyfriend. The place we originally wanted to go decided to close for a few days, therefore, I had to research another place. I started looking at top reviewed places in New York City and came to this restaurant, with amazing reviews. The pictures of the interior and food really caught my attention, so I decided to make a reservation (you can make one on their website). First off, the service was amazing. They checked in our jackets once we walked in and we were treated amazingly throughout the whole dinner. The interior really looked amazing like the pictures. The food overall was great, except I don't think they come out hot or warm, but not exactly cold where it's like they were left out for a long time. I got the lobster fried rice, pork buns, short ribs on scallion pancakes, and charred steak. The charred steak was definitely the best with medium rare and the sauce provided. The other dishes were good too, just nothing crazy or special. Overall, I had a good time because they even surprised me with a cake (with my boyfriend planning it), but still really nice that they were able to write ""happy anniversary"" on the plate."

Jackie S.,/user_details?userid=mMXUSVGUrOcUQZKm6MD1Ig,"Staten Island, NY",9/23/2019,4,Loved this Asian fusion restaurant. The edamame dumplings are to die for!!! Could literally just order that and eat those. Another amazing app is tuna tartare egg rolls. Wild mushroom chow fun is so flavorful I would def recommend getting that as well. Only downfall was that my friend and I found a hair in the noodles  they did comp it but still it was kind of gross
Nicole H.,/user_details?userid=zflSFRoDqEqJRNcSqCHV3A,"Winchester, MA",12/2/2021,1,"I was actually excited for our dinner reservation here and the venue was very pretty as seen from the pictures despite being extremely dark inside. However our experience was terrible; our server was extremely rude and pushy and was never even at our table except to take our order. It was one of the worst service experiences I've had in a while, I could feel him judging the age and look of my friends and I. Furthermore, when the manager (not even our server) brought our check, he would not split it between the four of us. I work in the service industry and this is something that takes only a few seconds to do, and I would assume at a fancy, expensive restaurant they would comply. Despite looking presentable, the food tasted WORSE than regular Chinese take out; the noodles were full of scallions and onions while the fried rice was subpar. The edamame dumplings were a sad twist on asian cuisine and tasted very weird. The food was honestly an insult to Asian cuisine, especially at its price point. Overall a horrible experience."
Angela M.,/user_details?userid=JypjCVmufxpXO2tymVpeCw,"San Fernando Valley, CA",3/26/2018,5,"Such a cute place for a date or a girls night out or a birthday party dinner. The restaurant is beautiful and the ambulance is amazing. The food was so tasty. We ordered the buttered lemon lobster which was amazing, the tuna tartare rolls were OK, mushroom noodles were amazing, lobster rice was actually very dry and non flavorful. Dim sum was fresh and tasty as well. I can't even remember the rest of the items we ordered but everything was overall very tasty"

Only negative I have is the host staff. These people were beyond rude. Refused to have conversation or even make eye contact. The person who walked us to the table acted like they were walking down a runway with his nose high in the air. This actually made us laugh. Overall I would suggest it."

Their lounge has ample seating and a full bar. It's very cozy. The staff was so patient with us, we asked to be seated else where twice and not once did they make us feel bad. The library room is very trendy and has a full bar. The main dining area is picture perfect. There's a long table with chandelier above it. Feels like Hogwarts. The food experience was top notch. Every dish we had had a great flavor profile. We understand by Bobby Flay loves this place so much. Every dish is shareable. The spring rolls were savory, the cauliflower-pops had a sweet twist, the soup dumplings can't be explained. The chili chicken had the perfect kick and crispy, while the stir fry veggies had a smoky bitterness you look for. We have been wanting to go for years and will be going back soon!"

Gredy V.,/user_details?userid=EFzWQRdfH79JVKMAVZ7s4w,"Jericho, NY",10/10/2020,3,"The food was ok, this place is literally across TAO, I had a 9:45 pm reservation this past weekend and was seated around 10:15. Our drink orders were taken 10:30. We ordered our food shortly after. Maybe 10 minutes into eating we were given the check and told us we have to wrap it up. I get it, our door dining has its rules, but if you aren't allowed to serve food outside by 11, don't leave reservations open so late. It's not fair and it's greedy. A warning that outdoor dining closes at 11 would of been appreciated but we are all blind sides. The food was not great either. I should of eaten across the street."

We got the sea bass, soup dumplings, lobster fried rice, wok vegetables, and a noodle dish (I think lo mein.) I would re-order everything expect the lo mein (there are just better dishes.) Also the restaurant is meant to be family style. We ended the night with cappuccinos, but they were a little less foamy than I prefer. All and all, it was a great experience :)"

We ordered the crispy cauliflower lollipops, lobster egg rolls, chili rock shrimp, short rib and scallion pancake, black pepper beef, black cod, wok tossed noodles with prawns & vegetable fried rice. We couldn't finish the lollipops, the cod, noodles or rice. The cod was so bland. Not worth it"

For apps we had the lobster rolls which was my favorite, and oxtail dumpling. Both very delicious and tasty. For dinner we had the lobster fried rice, crab in chill sauce and short ribs. Everything was amazing. For dessert we had a pistachios dessert which I was not a fan . Will definitely visit again."

Not a fan of the edamame dumplings, but out of all the dishes the glazed Alaskan black cod and the broken chili chicken were pretty tasty. Everything else tasted just okay."

For appetizers we got oxtail dumplings, lobster egg rolls, Cantonese egg rolls, ribs and more that I can't remember. For cocktails I got blush and my friend got tranquility. Entrees were AMAZING too! There wasn't one thing that we ordered and we wish we didn't, everything was super super super good. Thank you Ian & Buddakan for making my 22nd birthday special."

You can eat upstairs, downstairs, they have private seating areas, a bar. I can't say it's over priced Asian food bc it's far better. No immigration crab meat here. Food is fresh not too salty. The seaters however did not make good of the space. Ppl do not need to seat on top of each other when the place is empty. I do not want to sit next to ppl i don't know just bc we are both black. Would i go back yes. The stairs are a great photo opportunity (that's the regal part)."

Suzee Q.,/user_details?userid=hKAelF9K5XSL9bjQO7PpIw,"New York, NY",12/5/2019,5,"YUM. This was our first time here. It was dark and elegant and surprising and that's just walking to our table. We were very hungry and our waiter gave us some great suggestions. We got the Dim Sum Tasting for Two (which came out on Buddakan's version of tiered tea plate): tuna spring rolls, shrimp toast, tea smoked spare ribs, oxtail dumplings, cantonese spring roll. (We made a substitution of oxtail dumplings instead of the carrot dumplings.) The we got the Sweet and Crispy Jumbo Shrimp. Fabulous! We also got Glazed Alaskan Black Cod and the Crab Stir Fry Noodle. Yes, we over-ordered but we didn't care. Because then it was time for dessert! A deconstructed bowl of yumminess with freeze dried mousse. Our waiter was super attentive. The prices were, well, it's good food. Enjoy!"

Short rib and shrimp were my favorites. I liked the noodles but thought they were a bit salty. It was a ton of food and I even had leftovers. Overall 4 stars because everything was tasty, but we always had to wait a loooong time for our waiter so I'm going to hold onto that last star for now."

Oh and the Peking duck is soooooo good. OMG so many good things. And the drinks aren't bad either! Very strong!

Also, I'm not sure if there is any point to making a reservation as it took us 45 minutes to sit down, thankfully we were standing right there making ourselves visible, still took 45 minutes. They were apologetic and very kind, and gave us a complimentary glass with champagne each. The food made up for that experience and overall had a great night.

Erin V.,/user_details?userid=2rri5hWzM2geUj8L-N5H2g,"Sunrise, FL",12/6/2021,1,"It was actually such a bad experience, we didn't even eat there. We made a reservation in Open Table weeks before our trip. Once we arrived the hostess said we had made our reservation for outside and made us stand there for over 30 minutes to be sat. We recognized we never selected outside but figured it was a nice night so we would roll with it. The outside area was horrendous. No ambiance; you're essentially stuck next to garbage cans and boxes. Any other restaurant we ate at in NYC had a wonderful outdoors area. When we brought this to the managers attention he was so rude, he basically didn't care. Even after identifying it was there mistake, that we never chose outside seating. From there, it just got worse. It was so bad, that even though it was the last night of our trip we chose to leave and take our chances somewhere else with no reservations. We chose to leave and go to TAO instead who accommodated us very quickly and with complete respect. They were absolutely wonderful and the meal was delicious."

Cool clubby ambiance, definitely unique. What's valuable here is there are a few ""tasting menu"" options like prix fixe groupings you can choose from so you don't take so much time trying to pick individual items off the menu while getting a good variety of food. And then when the food came, everything was delicious and well seasoned/well prepared/tasty. Definitely recommend for a dinner with a group before going out! Good cocktails too!!!"

We did the $85 tasting menu and it was 8 of us and there was food left over, that's how much they give you , which for someone like me who eats a lot, is definitely a plus ! Everything that was included in this tasting was mouth watering amazing ! I had their smoke drink (mezcal ) and it was so good ! Biggest highlight was definitely their dumplings , pork buns , lobster rice and cod. Overall, for a special occasion I'd highly recommend this place . I will be coming back for sure !"

The lounge area - dark, seductive and sophisticated. That giant mural behind the check in area is gorgeous. Enter down the stairs to the dining area - high ceilings, great music, and an awesome vibe. It would've been better to choose a quieter place for our function BUT it was definitely a night that no one will forget. Everyone raved about the food and the staff were more than accommodating. Tasting menus at different prices and they will work with you to provide budget savvy wines. Also very caring to vegetarians and allergies. Excellent. Will come again."

It's super dimly lit so I actually had to watch where I was stepping to make sure I didn't trip, but I get the vibes - dark, mystic, sexy. We came as a party of 3 and ordered way more food than we realized. We had the tea smoked spare ribs, chili rock shrimp, lobster fried rice, wok charred broccoli, mongolian lamb chops and ma la chicken. The bottle of malbec we got paired nicely with the meal as well. This is definitely one of those splurge dinner places and perfect for if you want to celebrate a special occasion. Also love the main dining room vibe - reminds me a bit of Hogwarts."

The ambiance of the restaurant is very intimate vibes but it can be a bit hard to see before your eyes adjust. I love that there is a coat check, and a little lounge area to wait in before being seated. I attended a birthday dinner here and after being shown to our table, we each ordered a main and a bunch of side dishes to share, sooooo good! I would def recommend a visit here and although it can be a bit expensive every once in a while isn't bad."

I had the lobster fried rice and tea spare ribs, both amazing choices. The portions are a little small, so you may have to order multiple dishes if you go on an empty stomach. The wait was not long for a Saturday night. My party made reservations, and we only weren't seated right away because we were still waiting for others in my party to show up. As soon as they showed up, we were seated within 2 minutes! Great service, every staff member was polite and friendly. Great food!"

Johnny T.,/user_details?userid=H7hP0ubIDCoQFNsu4Cih2g,"Flower Mound, TX",9/24/2019,3,Good food and ambiance. Duck was notable as was the pork buns and soup dumplings. I would not recommend getting their tap water as it tastes terrible and certainly has a flavor to it. Service of items was interesting since lobster fried rice came out before the entrees and there was some wait involved. I'd recommend this spot if you are entertaining a client or doing business on the company card.

Sara A.,/user_details?userid=EfcU7yDkU-6NBfBJcaJmMA,"Valley Stream, NY",7/31/2021,2,"The ambience and vibe is cool, similar Tao across the street (which likely has better food in my humble opinion. We got the monk fish, lobster fried rice, rock shrimp appetizer. The saffron lobster fried rice was veryyy underwhelming, not something to write home about. While there was lobster meat visible (they didn't skimp out) the dish was bland. There was no saffron, just yellow food coloring. The monk fish was a fried dish coated in a jarred sauce with some stale peanuts. The shrimp appetizer was good- but again, very basic. Overall we spent $120 and take out Chinese would have been more satisfying. I had high hopes for this place. Our waiter was attentive and kind, but he needed to be nice in order to makeup for the average meh food. take your money elsewhere."

We enjoyed everything that was put on our table. I started with the Royal to drink. It was very good. We ordered the Dim Sum Tasting for three and Pork Buns. All delicious! We decided to get one entree and three sides to split for the table : Ma La Chicken, Wild Mushroom Chow Fun (Favorite for the night!) Wok Charred Broccoli and Tai San Cauliflower (Amazing!!) I have to say the noodles were the hit for the table and the Chicken was our least favorite for the night. That being said.......there was absolutely nothing wrong with the chicken at all. Everything else was just so very good!! I will definitely be back and highly recommend to anyone in the area!!"

Wine serving was the smallest proportion I have seen and very fancy names for the blandest of food. We got a chicken and a beef dish. Both were kind of gross. The only thing good was the wine, staff and oxtail dumplings."
Harry K.,/user_details?userid=exuiRAuuFkF4ZYfCAinAXA,"New York, NY",9/17/2020,3,"I hadn't been to Buddakan for some time. I love the interior of the restaurant but it was my birthday and I've O Deeeed on Pastis, needed another place to go. I was put against a brick wall on a table for two, was told the larger tables were being held for larger parties, I get that but we were moved to a larger table, still against the brick wall. and opposite a table that had 8 very loud people.  Menu looked good so we ordered the most delicious tuna tartar roll, dumplings which were ordinary, a pork concoction with no flavor, huge lobster rolls, OK but needed a zing the sauce didn't really give, a glass of Verve hit the spot and we decided not to order anything else and as we walked towards the street there were many large tables with just two people sitting there, so much for the large parties"

The menu and venue are what caught my attention when booking this reservation however after reading the actual reviews I got worried that we'd be disappointed by food.  The venue is absolutely breathtaking. Beautiful and grand. The drinks were delicious and I NEVER order specialty cocktails when I go out since they tend to be weak and overly sweet, but they were top notch here. We had the dumpling tower, the bao buns and the wild mushroom chow fun. The bao buns were AMAZING. Perfect balance of sweet and salty very well balanced dish and just stunning. 100% order! The dumpling tower was delicious as well. I've eaten Dimsum thousands of times and thought this was a creative and delicious spin. The carrot dumpling and the edamame dumplings were so good and surprisingly our fav. The pork potsticker was  generic but still tasty. Lastly the wild mushroom chow fun was good. great wok fried flavor but it had like three mushrooms where I was expecting it to be the star of the dish as if it were the main protein. Delicious dish but not worth the price and lacking in shrooms. Overall we were pleasantly surprised and loved everything we had. I only give this a 4 star and not a 5 because we didn't order any of the other dishes. We will def be coming back!!!"

Buddakan was totally amazing for it's  decorations and ambience.  BUT, their customer service with our waitress named Monica, was beyond horrendous! We flew in from out of town to have this surprised birthday bash for one of our girlfriend that we had made a reservation prior. Let me just get to the point......Our food was cleared out of the table without being asked! As you know their food was not all that cheap, so when I turned around and saw all of our meals was all swept off our table, I was kind of blown away! Not to mention, at least 50% of our food was still on the platters. One of our friend happened to work for an Embassy, which she is qualify for tax exempt, so we mentioned to the server to get our bill tax exempt, which she did got it taken the tax off, but in returned, she kept it as her tip WITHOUT us offering it!!!! May I mention one more time that she did not offer tax exempt to us but instead she kept it for her tip! We asked for the receipt, after waiting for approximately half an hour which she never came.  We finally had to go to the front desk and asked the front desk to go get our receipt. Unfortunately, our dinner that night was ruined due to that one server. But thankfully, we made it up over at a restaurant called Magic Hour Rooftop Bar Lounge at the Moxie Hotel. Since I was the one who did the booking, I failed to read all of the comments on yelp before going. Hope this help those who are wondering what it is like at Buddakan...."

Reecha B.,/user_details?userid=S8j47jpGa9cv_awIA1tHFw,"Seattle, WA",3/11/2019,4,I love coming to Buddakan with very high ceilings and a grand entrance. I like how they have seatings in the waiting area. The fusion dumplings are awesome and they have veg options as well! They also do have a range of non alcoholic options. I always feel it's a date place but I have been always here with corporate groups.

Branfa B.,/user_details?userid=vfR9nfFdFB3WeYnloQoWkA,"Brooklyn, NY",4/23/2021,2,"This used to be an amazing restaurant, pre-pandemic, with consistently superb food and very attentive service. Prices were high, but well worth it. After indoor dining reopened we booked a table for two to celebrate a special occasion, on a Monday night. Everything we ordered was subpar -- either bland or too salty or overcooked. The service was pretty abysmal as well. We had a trainee waiter who had no idea what he was doing. Perhaps it was a bad night, but I suspect the reason for this disaster may be others: they had to let go of many of their long-time kitchen and wait staff, and the new hires are not up to the old levels of excellence (yet?). A true disappointment."

The best Mongolian Lamb Chops, the meat just falls off the bone and is filled with flavor. Peking Duck Fried rice was just as delicious and portioned just right. My overall experience was just simply amazing with so much flavor, I will definitely be back and would recommend this business to anyone looking for a tasty meal and a nice friendly place.

The food is just.. expensive chinese food.. over over priced. we paid $200 per person for stuff like dumplings, chow meen, sticky rice, duck, chicken... the place is very pretty though.. music are loud and dark in there. Great for a date night or girls night out but def not for a big group. you sit on a long table where you cant even communicate with the other end of the group anyways so what is the point? also they charge you $125 for a ""special event fee"" why?! what! ?"

Liz D.,/user_details?userid=Lw1CvoHdDjWirTVSmfjM4g,"Brooklyn, NY",7/31/2018,3,"The place has a great ambiance.  Perfect for a date night. I came here for a friends birthday celebration. The food in my opinion was ok. For the price we paid I dont think worth it. They push you to do somewhat of family style dinner and recommend  getting a ton of entrees and apps. Which pushes the bill up. I think that just wasn't the best way. The best things I tasted were the pork bun, pepper beef, broccoli and the rock shrimp. Everything else didn't do it for me. Especially the mala chicken(Sp?) . It left a bad after taste. All in all, it was a good place to try but dont see myself going back in the foreseeable future. The service was good. They paid attention to clearing the table efficiently."

The 3 star review is because dish I wanted to try was very different than what I expected. I had Singapore chili crab at a food stall in Singapore and flagged this place a the only place on NYC with the dish on a searchable menu.iy was nothing like what I ate in Singapore!  Not bad just not authentic the rest of the food was just ok. The service was good and so was the atmosphere.i didn't like that we had to wait for our table in the crowded bar area only to find that the rest out the restaurant was barely at capacity. This place is also hard to find using GPS.

D E L I C I O U S! It has been one of the best dinners I have ever had. Expensive but it will be worth every penny. Fully recommended!

Got sat at the front bar area, ordered food. Food never came. Asked the waitress 1/2 hour how long till our order comes out, she said any minute.. they are walking out with it now. Hour and a half later still no food. Asked for the check so we can just pay for our drinks and leave. Lied again and said its coming out. I asked for the check and they were annoying about it persistently lying that my food is about to come out any minute. Missed the show I had after dinner. Shit restaurant. Doesn't matter if you have reservations or not you'll always be treated poorly at buddakan."

Muhammed S.,/user_details?userid=3yPsfjUqmpSPL1urRoPPpA,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",10/14/2019,5,If you are ever taking someone out to eat Chinese food and you want to wow them this is the place to go. The atmosphere is perfect for intimacy and the food will satisfy all of your taste buds. I have been coming to this restaurant for years and I have never been let down the service has always been A1 and the food even better than how I remembered it. I am a seafood lover so I would advise you to start off your eating experience with the rock shrimp as an appetizer. For a main entrée I would say the Singapore chili king crab and I would say order the lobster fried rice. I promise you you will not be let down.I would also say dress to impress this is definitely not one of those dressdown spots even though it is not frowned upon you definitely want to look your best.
Elaine M.,/user_details?userid=dWTPu6hJ6U2bDfxeWOsTEw,"Queens, Queens, NY",10/2/2021,3,"A bougie place, but way overpriced for what is chinese food. We had the tasting menu I for a friend's birthday. The only dish that really stood out was the potato dumplings since I think there was some sort of truffle oil that made it very flavorful. They definitely put more time on dessert, or maybe they have a dessert chef, because they were excellent. Otherwise, as a Chinese person who have had plenty of Chinese food in my days, this was very ""meh"". I had the Tranquility on the drink menu, the drink was weak, and it reminded me of lemonade. The place is a bit too dark for my taste, and the music a bit too loud. The bathroom..I can hardly see myself and it's especially creepy with a portrait of person of the 18-19th century staring at you when you enter the dark dark stall. There are taxidermy animals in some glass cases against the wall. The middle of the restaurant reminds you of Harry Potter (a reason why the birthday girl want a celebration here). You're really paying for the environment you're in and to be part of the cool club."
Nizam S.,/user_details?userid=unw68H5JNO0my9QEfEl9hg,"Manhattan, NY",2/20/2021,1,I highly recommend going here if you enjoy being disrespected by hostesses and wait staff as well as being humiliated whilst trying to take a photo. Be warned. Birthday RUINED.

The place is huge and great ambiance. Not too loud, tons of space.  It's next door to Chelsea Market and in a great location.  One of the best meals I have ever had."

Only the rock shrimp and blush drink was 10/10!!!! The steak was 7/10. The chilli chicken and lobster egg roll was 5/10. However, Josh, our waiter gave us 12/10 exceptional service. Initially, my boyfriend first got the sizzling rib-eye and ended up hating it so much. Josh was sooo kind enough to replace it with steak. Not only that, he explained every item on the menu very thoroughly. Thank you josh for the amazing service! We will be going back for the shrimp and the drink."

Molly T.,/user_details?userid=MCVQ5kvI16l01MtK1hQIRQ,"Manhattan, NY",3/12/2021,5,Insanely good food. The Lychee martini is insanely delicious. Our server was so sweet and gave great recommendations. I do not recommend the Monkfish. The pork buns were insane. As were the General Tso and Pork dumplings. Definitely coming back!!
Caroline D.,/user_details?userid=aq-l9CMUuePj0JvhO3hvMw,"Brooklyn, NY",10/28/2017,5,"This is my go to whenever relatives are in town. The menu is extensive and even the most picky eaters (ahem, my mother) are happy with the menu. The best way to experience it is just to order a few plates to all share. My personal favorites are the char grilled steak (the mustard sauce is next level), the spicy tuna spring rolls, crab sticky rice, cauliflower curry, pecking duck, and soup dumplings. This place also has a great ambiance, and the dining room pretty much looks like Hogwarts. Service is great, but make sure to make a res awhile in advance!"

Jori Rose S.,/user_details?userid=0RuOMmuwtRB8jJwFHdUq5g,"New York, NY",5/10/2018,5,"Buddakan is a beautiful, trendy restaurant conveniently located right next to Chelsea Market! While the aesthetics of the space are truly stunning (it felt more like an upscale hotel lobby than a restaurant!), the food and service were just as wonderful. We ordered the Tuna Tartare Spring Rolls, King Crab & Lobster Shumai, Sweet & Crispy Jumbo Shrimp, Whole Sea Bass, Wild Mushroom Chow Fun, and the Dungeness Crab Sticky Rice to share between four people and it was more than enough food! For dessert, we ordered the Crying Chocolate (malted ganache, vietnamese coffee ice cream--so good!) and the Mochi Doughnuts (raspberry, matcha & vanilla cream--my favorite!) which were out of this world good. While the dishes are on the pricier side, this is a fantastic spot for a fancy and fun night out!"

I've been here before a few times as well. The quality, service and attention to detail is excellent! Also, the ambiance and decor is so special and grand. Everything was so smooth since we got there, our table so intimate and perfect. We started with the edamame dumplings which are to die for! Then we got the pork buns, they are other worldly!! Then we got the charred filet of beef with wonton crisps and a side of Asian green stir fry and it was absolutely delicious!! For dessert, we had the raspberry and matcha mochi, they were good but I've had better mochi. It was so sweet they noted when I called that it was my 30th, and they brought it out with a candle and a happy birthday note. I love this restaurant and I can't wait to go back!!"

gabriel m.,/user_details?userid=30uf4qsB9RAqZFMiJG9-sw,"Decatur, GA",4/17/2018,5,Amazing food and worth the high price tag.  I went twice in as many weeks. Their dishes are fresh yet stick to the core of their roots.  We did a chefs menu the second time and were very happy with it as many dishes I wouldn't have ordered were brought out.  One was better than the last.  Keep it up!!

If you love  Asian food you will be in heaven. My favorite is the Mongolian lamb chops with a crystalized ginger crust. The pot stickers are amazing as well. The interiors although are loud but are still tranquil and beautiful. I highly recommend for a night on the town or with a large group. Amazing & Memorable!

The waiters and waitresses are very nice and knowledgeable and also, patient ( we had a few late party members) once we were seated thought the waiter went through the menu throughly as we were newcomers.  The food came out wickedly fast and it was still very hot. We all shared and everything was equally amazing! Would definitely visit again."

At times it was even slimy The best part of this place was the restaurant itself and not the food. I was very disappointed with the food and for what we paid for to."
Kathy S.,/user_details?userid=hY0A9hK8pGQ4nYw8-kc5WQ,"Brooklyn, NY",9/16/2017,5,This place is beautiful...the decor is absolutely stunning. I came here for my cousins birthday. We decided to go with the taste testing menu and tried so much food. The food was all very tasty and we had the option of reordering the dish we liked. I came out of there feeling so full but happy
Donna H.,/user_details?userid=qarDKI3yWLmz8_DxCbTpvw,"Manhattan, NY",12/30/2019,5,"This place right here. Thats all I can say; the food was nothing short of  magically. As people, we eat everyday but when food is combined with the right ingredients, magic can happen and it is places like this that remind you of that. I'm 2 seconds from looking up if the chef is cute and single lol. I had the lobster rolls, Asia stir fry, Hong Kong shrimp and scallops and 5 grains rice. Everything was amazing. The vibe and the food was on point. My only issues were:  the tables were all very close together and it was very easy to hear other tables conversations, the candle at the table kept going out and there were only 2 bathrooms and always a line ( not sure if there were more downstairs) but these were severe enough to take a star off."
Arthur D.,/user_details?userid=Qski2Y3xMAhMNQpZPHe97Q,"Washington, DC",2/12/2019,5,"This is my favorite restaurant in New York, and one of my favorite overall. The menu is full of tatsy items from appetizers all the way through dessert. My favorite entree has to be the shrimp and lobster chow fun, which comes with 3 or 4 very large shrimp and a hearty serving of flavorful lobster, in addition to a generous portion of veggies. The dessert menu seems to evolve regularly (as does the rest of the menu), but my go-to has been and still is the pistachio cremoso -- it's complex and delicious sweet treat with all sorts of great flavors and textures. I highly recommend Buddakan for a business dinner or date night!"

I did call to make an appointment and had pre ordered a birthday dessert. We were 15 minutes late, the hostess were accommodating and got us seated quickly. To start off, right when you walk down from the grand stair case, you could see the grand decor. This restaurant is trendy and upscale. The servers are well trained, and are attentive. They do go above and beyond in creating an unforgettable dining experience.  Also, our server made great recommendations. For appetizers we ordered the dim sum tasting for two. All of the items were delicious. My favorite included the tea smoked spare ribs, and the tuna spring rolls. The ribs were cooked to perfection!  Definitely try the dim sum tasting for two! The entrees were tasty, and filling. Buddakan is a an excellent special occasion restaurant"

Charles D.,/user_details?userid=386X7625rVwMbaJgFTQD-Q,"New York, NY",10/29/2018,4,"Let's start with the bad stuff. I was shocked to see so many pretentious people in Buddakan. I shouldn't be surprised considering the area. Some folks were completely delusional on how they viewed themselves. They acted as if the world revolved around them. Buddakan is a trendy place with a great atmosphere and look. The food was great. I especially liked the  chili rock shrimp, general tso's dumplings and the charred Filet Of Beef. I wasn't a fan of their specialty cocktails but to each his own. The music was great, a mix of old and new. I also had a great server named Calvin who knew his shit. I will definitely go back, I just have to avoid the pretentious crowd. I went on a Saturday around 10pm."
Juju K.,/user_details?userid=bhk04kv2BU9tVRUeJ7808w,"New York, NY",6/30/2019,3,"The restaurant is beautiful and so unique.  The main dining room is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, I found the food to be just okay though, a level above PF Chang.  Perhaps we did't order the right dishes.  The tuna tartare was a great start.  The kitchen never sent the edamame dumplings.   We felt that we ordered so much food, we didn't make a big an issue out of it.  Soon they brought the lobster rice, chili king Alaskan crab, kung pao monkfish, and cauliflower veggie side dish.  I found all the dishes had cloyingly sweet duck sauce-ish sauce, except for the rice.   The rice didn't come out hot.   It was mildly seasoned, subtle saffron taste, almost undetectable.  The biggest disappointment was the king crab due to the very sweet sauce.    Some parts of the crab seemed too dry.   The monkfish was fried with a great crunch and a bit of heat, but again the sauce is on the sweeter side.  The service didn't seem to line up with the price and atmosphere. I was expecting a more refined service.   The tea cup came without a saucer, the runners just placed them without care, same with how they placed the dessert spoons.   Perhaps I'm being picky.   I'm sure there are some standout dishes, but I'm in no hurry to go back and find them.   It's one of those places you want to cross off your list.   As far as dessert, the crying chocolate dessert was pretty good but the molten ganache cake part was very sweet indeed.  I indicated it was for birthday on the reservation app, and it was nice of them to write happy birthday  on the dessert."

Everything about this place is special - the cool ambience  with high ceilings, the food, drinks and service. Impressive. We ordered from the tasting menu so did not have to choose anything. The Alaskan cod was really good and so were the various appetizers. We had a large table in the middle though I would have preferred if they had round tables for large groups but they don't. This is also a great place to go for a special occasion."

Krista K.,/user_details?userid=jux-TBA5e6-XU29yI_p8JA,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",7/6/2018,5,I came with 8 girls for my friends birthday and the reservation was for 7 o'clock but traffic was horrendous so most of us were running late and the hostesses were very accommodating to our needs. We waited in the lounge until the full party arrived and they sat us in the long table in the dining room around 7:30. Our waitress even though i didn't catch her name was very sweet and helpful when ordering. She showed up the tasting menu which seemed like a great idea although we just got a bunch of dishes and split them. The food was yummy and the ambience was so trendy and cool. I will be coming back

Riya M.,/user_details?userid=HMHtgLwk9lisk0ZRCzK0aw,"West Hollywood, CA",8/10/2019,4,"Came for dinner and drinks and really enjoyed it! Started off with the general tsao dumplings which were decent but I wouldn't order them again and the pork buns which I enjoyed. But what made the whole night was the monkfish. This dish was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had out and I would return back solely for this one item!! We also ordered a side of the crab glass noodles with it per recommendation of our waitress and it tasted amazing with it. Was really satisfied with how helpful she was in picking out what we'd like. Also the drinks were good and strong! And you'll probably want to order some seeing as even if you have a reservation, you're most likely to end up waiting 30 minutes in their lounge. Definitely recommend going to try it out for better quality Asian food"

Kimberly T.,/user_details?userid=YWRBXUMM52yAVvSnJXdeBw,"San Francisco, CA",7/13/2019,4,"Though a clubby / edgy vibe, Buddakan does actually have really good food. It feels pretty similar to Beauty & Essex -- good food, very rich, and heavy on the fusion side of Asian fusion. That being said, food actually is really good. On the pricier side, and good for larger groups since it's a huge restaurant"

When you walk in the doors to the restaurant, it feels like you're entering Gatsby's home. The decor is simply stunning and artistically crafted. The drink menu was so creative and innovative with their recipes. Our waitress was such a doll and so quick. Finally the menu had various scrumptious options it was hard to choose! I've told many friends to go here. Will be returning!"
Rebecca V.,/user_details?userid=OaraIxlmu2IPYH6D4__hPg,"Montclair, NJ",11/6/2017,3,"I was really disappointed here. The cost of each dish didn't measure up to the quality. I ordered the tuna tartare spring roll ($15-18) they were just mediocre. I ordered the king crab as my entree ($38) it was really fishy and salty, not good at all. I love crab and didn't even want to finish it. My favorite thing was the dessert I can't forget to mention that, it was pretty good. I have to admit the ambiance is amazing and the presentation was great. Service was fantastic as well! However, I don't think I'll be returning when there are so many great restaurants locally for better quality and less $$. My friend has the same complaints as I do , so I know I'm not being boujee"
Jai B.,/user_details?userid=AGT8_AVl_W3ejplPLjfzTA,"Chicago, IL",4/13/2019,5,"Good food good drinks great service. Be careful you'll be interested in ordering several dishes but they come out quick and large portions.

Divya R.,/user_details?userid=kedEvKpkWaDRbQxxRsfxgw,"Passaic, NJ",4/30/2018,4,"This is a cute restaurant for date night as it has a great ambiance. Surprisingly didn't have to wait long since I reserved a spot right when it opened around 5. One of the hostess at the front desk cut me short in a fake manner when I tried to tell her my reservation name but our waiter was very attentive and patient, which I appreciated. The edamame dumplings dish is probably the most popular here, and I found it to be okay. It has a creamy texture. The Mongolian lamp chops are definitely worth a try. The rice dishes are nothing special. Also, the bathroom is very dark so be careful. Sitting downstairs is the best option since you get a great view of the pretty lights and can actually take nice pictures. Loved the interior."
Chantal C.,/user_details?userid=HIRA0BccGEVEYzCFJMFalg,"Los Angeles, CA",12/12/2016,5,"I love this restaurant !!! The food , the ambience the staff, everything is amazing about it . I am a regular it's been 12 years  and my favorite dishes that I order every time I go there are cantonese spring rolls , edamame dumpling , vegetable rice and charred filet of beef . I don't know why but I just can't get enough of it . I order this same things for all my friends visiting from Europe and every single one of them would get excited as much I do. This gorgeous restaurant is very busy and if you don't find a table there is a bar as soon as u walk in on your left or there is another one downstairs where you can sit without a reservation and have your dinner .

I like that they had an area for us to relax and order drinks while we waited for our table! They serve everything family style, so my husband and I ordered 3  apps, 2 main dishes, and 1 side. It was WAY too much food for just the two of us, but we wanted to try several things and had a hard time narrowing it down. My favorites were the Oxtail Dumplings, short rib, and the king crab (although I think my husband ate the entire bowl- safe to say this was his favorite!) I would suggest going here with 4+ people if you like to try multiple dishes :)"

Deb M.,/user_details?userid=uvqhDdqRyl1aqTlxu_UZtg,"Canton, MI",8/26/2016,4,"Chose this place as our last meal in NY based on the suggestion of someone we met at Chesley Market and all of the great Yelp reviews of course.  We were not disappointed. Love the sleek sexy look and feel of this place.  We felt slightly under-dressed as we had been out to Ellis Island earlier in the day.  Great date night spot. We arrived shortly after they opened and grabbed a table in the lounge area.  We had snacked our way through the  Market and weren't super hungry so we chose the vegetable fried rice and the noodles with prawns. Both dishes were very tasty and I thought the serving sizes were on the bigger size. The menu had some great sounding dishes that made me wish I had been famished. There are no happy hour specials and the cocktail prices are high,  stick with a beer, the one I ordered wasn't all that great.  It was Tim M's birthday so they brought out a small scoop of ice cream,  nice touch.  It was soy flavored and tasted similar to salted caramel, very good.  Would definitely return here on our next trip to NYC."
Katherine D.,/user_details?userid=LjcURB6OdxTkZVUKuN2G4w,"New York, NY",12/10/2018,5,"This was such a lovely experience. I went after seeing a play, and it was the perfect way to wrap up the day. It's family style and while it would be expensive individually, the check was better than I expected when we split it! Cocktails are $18-20. We ordered the edamame dumplings and they were so delicious we ordered them twice. They were rich and buttery, and far more interesting than edamame by itself. We also ordered the short rib scallion pancakes which were delicious and so different from regular scallion pancakes. They were rich in flavor and delicious. We also ordered the noodles with mushrooms and prawns which was a perfect dish to share. There were a lot of prawns in it too. Lastly we ordered pork dumplings which you really can't ever go wrong with. If I ordered one more thing it would've been the shrimp toast. The decor is so beautiful and unique and really made this a special evening."

Rick R.,/user_details?userid=gM2Jvv595q-59ilOD2oPJw,"Glencoe, IL",10/8/2017,5,Ate here last minute on a Sunday. To say I was impressed is an understatement and I'm a chef and own my own 5 star restaurant in Chicago. The Tuna Tartare egg roll picture just doesn't do justice to how great they are. Our server was amazing she made sure if we ordered anything and there was only 3 to an order to order an extra 2 for the table cause we were sharing everything. The place itself is so impressive when you walk in and head down the stairs to your table and you see that enormous table from the sex and the city scene your night stays at that level the whole evening. The food and drinks were incredible. It not inexpensive by no means but well worth every penny will be back for sure and will visit there other locations in other cities for sure

The decoration looks like the harry potter theme downstair. The food they serve is excellent and savory. Our server accommodates our diet and allergy. She's very pleasant and she knows what she is recommending in terms of food (sorry not good with names). I can't wait to go back here
LeAnne B.,/user_details?userid=s6fmAliBn4-pNR7udaTQ7g,"New York, NY",4/30/2019,5,"Perfection from start to finish. Also, this is my absolute go-to place for taking any group for dinner (great for when you have 6+ people) because this place is spacious! I love the dining room and how it's set on the lower level. The decor in general is just amazing and gives off this mysterious Far East vibe. We were seated at a comfy booth in the corner and could not have gotten a better spot. As for the food, I highly recommend going with one of the tasting menus. Unlike most tasting menus in the city, this one has enough food and excellent variety. We went with tasting menu #2 and I was blown away with how delicious every single dish was. My favorite on that menu had to be the beef. It had such a distinct, rich flavor. I also appreciate how the mocktails look and have names like cocktails so you can discreetly choose a nonalcoholic drink. ;) My second favorite dish had to be the shrimp and then the cod - though it's quite hard to choose because every dish is done to perfection. Dessert blew me away - the pistachio ice cream is not to be missed and the chocolate lava cake is phenomenal. I also appreciated that the manager came around to check on our experience.

Salma E.,/user_details?userid=Ei6UlmtUL7jONP2QVFe3cQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/29/2018,5,"The best restaurant I have ever been to. I swear, I cannot make this up. Buddakan is a dim lighted, diamond in the rough restaurant located in the heart of the meat packing district, home to many over hyped, subpar eateries. The overall ambience of the restaurant is to die for, decor is stunning, food is amazing, flavorful, fresh, and amazing. This is a perfect date night choice (my go-to for sure), and is also great for groups of friends looking for an upbeat, yet not overbearing place to have a 5 star meal. We will continue to come back as the customer service is superb, timely, and orders are always well executed. The prices are fair for the quality that you're getting, however, this is not an every week eat, which makes visits frequent, yet far between, but makes you cherish them even more. Can't wait to come back."
Evelyn B.,/user_details?userid=dZvErUjFSbG9bmoEgFDYFg,"New York, NY",10/5/2019,1,NYC traffic construction madness you get to the restaurant they inform you that although you are late for your reservation they will honor.  I wish they hadn't because our party waited in the lounge for over an hour and a half only to have to go to the reservation desk and be told that they have not even started finding a table.. we then decided to leave is when the director came out to try and convince us to continue to wait.  They should at least come out and tell you they cant accomodate late comers I respect that more than sit and wait til never.. thanks to the sit and wait as a punishment we were unable to celebrate a birthday dinner.  Thanks

There were only two bathroom stalls for both men and women to use in the area we were sitting. Astonished that for such a large fancy establishment the bathroom situation was such a hassle. Also, the take out food containers were disappointing, worse than your local chinese restaurant, the container soaked up all the sauce from my meal and seeped through."

We made reservations weeks before since this was all planned out. When we got there we did have to wait a little while by the bar and waiting area. The wait time wasn't too bad at all. Our reservation was made for 5:15 on a Saturday. The whole staff was beyond friendly and accommodating. They sat us downstairs on the long table as we were a party of 11. It was such a beautiful set up. Since almost all of us have never been here before, we had a few questions about the menu and needed a few things described to us. Our waitress was awesome! The food in itself was impressive. I enjoyed it more then I thought I would. We got several different dishes ranging from dumplings to noodle dishes to meat dishes. All were superb. I will definitely be back one day"

This one is a new opening in NYC and similar to Philly. Start off at the fancy bar with some drinks, then the waitress will lead you down to the dinning area with chandeliers. We are primarily appetizers (duck salad, tuna sashimi, fried shrimp, grilled tenderloin, lobster fried rice and dumplings) all delicious. Will be back either to this or the one in Philly."

Tia S.,/user_details?userid=-PJJCL1rMRL685-4ypdnsg,"Orlando, FL",8/5/2017,5,"About last night...this was one of the most delicious meals I've had in a while. From the customer service to the wonderful flavors of the food. I would recommend the following: from the ""Dim Sum"" the lobster egg rolls are amazing...they have a little spice...I personally don't do spicy food...but these are so worth it. The next item I tried was the cauliflower lollipops, by the way I never knew cauliflower could taste so good. For the main entree I had the sea bass, head to the tail and it was also very flavorful with cabbage on top. To finalize this magnificent meal you have to try the pistachio ice cream dessert, it had nuts, chocolate mouse, flourless chocolate cake, and cherries too boot, all flavors that  absolutely just melt in your mouth."
Rid D.,/user_details?userid=rxiv-w3VvMNqBgWTcoGEVA,"Manhattan, NY",3/27/2019,4,Great place for business dinners or date night. The edamame dumplings are the BEST I've ever had and I would probably go back to just order those! The rest of the menu is pretty typical but dishes are done well. It's a wonderful place to see and be seen. An absolute must if you're trying to impress someone from out of town and want to show them the city scene.
Nancy W.,/user_details?userid=AauouI08oLswSeOV_CmdAQ,"Long Island, NY",2/2/2017,5,"This place is so impressive from the decor to the service to the amazing food!  The first time we went was during the Sex and the City days when people were doing the tours because of the movie.  We decided to avoid the whole tour bus thing and go on our own, and it was just incredible.  The second time was just as great and so much fun.  Both times we went were on a Saturday so it was very crowded, but the place is so big it didn't feel uncomfortable.  Their drink menu is so awesome that it makes you want to try every drink on the menu!  This is a place to definitely go to when you're in the city...it's a truly unique,  and fun experience!"

They even made waiting for your table enjoyable in the lounge, someone came to take our drink order and everything. The lychee martini was great and so was the drink at the top of the menu that was a twist on a Long Island ice tea, so good. The Peking duck fried rice was to die for. I also loved the cauliflower balls, the pork belly buns, and these wide noodles. The chili rock shrimp that everyone raves about was fine, but I could take it or leave it. I've had better and I would prefer to leave room for the other more amazing things on the menu. All in all, I can't wait to come back here again!"

The place is breathtakingly beautiful (high ceilings, paintings, book shelf walls, chandeliers, candles, and dim lighting). It is the perfect place for a date, but definitely recommend coming here with a group or friends as well. Everything we ordered was mouthwatering. If you like soup dumplings, order the general tso's dumpings. You won't be disappointed. We got the short rib scallion pancake as well and I wish we got another 4 more orders of those! Black pepper beef was soft and tasty and so were the wok noodles. I'd pass on the chicken and shrimp spring rolls next time..they weren't anything special and the menu looks like it has way better options. I can't wait to come back here and try new things. 10/10 recommend!"
Karin A.,/user_details?userid=9LfYBr9jPEm95qAnmgspNQ,"Middle Village, NY",8/5/2016,4,"My friend wanted to come here for her birthday and we all had a very nice time. Decor is very modern - almost a bit too much in my opinion - the entry to the restaurant reminded me of a hotel front desk more than a place you sit down for dinner. Our waiter was very lovely and accommodating. I decided to try their edamame dumplings and the chilled udon noodles. Both were nice dishes - but I must say that I wasn't too impressed by the edamame dumplings. I expected more flavor (?) and reminded me a little bit of the taste and consistency of mashed potatoes inside. Glad I tried them out but I wouldn't order them again. Noodles were nice - I enjoyed the pear sorbet that came with it however I didn't like the ginger ""candies"" that were shredded into the noodles. Would have preferred real shredded ginger instead of the candy version. It was a good choice though for a hot NYC summer day."
Kelsey S.,/user_details?userid=mVrH-ftbrTOym2DhSi3uBA,"New York, NY",10/4/2019,3,"The service was the best part of this meal (our waiter was excellent). The food, however, was overpriced and tasteless. I've had just as good food for a quarter of the price - wouldn't waste my time here"
ML V.,/user_details?userid=NoMuV2W2901alkFOhVlfIw,"New York, NY",6/22/2020,5,We came here for my friend's birthday last October and loved it!  We got to sit at the communal table and it was just gorgeous. We did the Tasting Menu 1. Food was excellent and service was great. Loud but we just talked over it and did fine.  The only negative was that my husband said they only had craft beer not Budweiser or Corona which he prefers.
Jodi H.,/user_details?userid=eulZIqp5zJT5tI1hHzebcA,"Manhattan, NY",1/24/2021,5,"Thoroughly impressed with food, safety procedures and outdoor seating.  Tables are very well spaced apart, tall and wide barriers between tables, completely open on one side so there is lots of air circulation, good spacing from people walking by.  I don't usually dine out during the pandemic but when walking by I was so impressed with the setup I couldn't resist.  Staff had masks, temp checks and hand sanitizer at check in.  It was a real 28 degrees outside and we were not uncomfortable or too cold to eat with the heat lamps and piped hot air ducts.  The food was delicious. Had the lunch dim sum sampler for two and the Chinese sausage friend rice.  The fried rice was amazing.  It was  light, delicate, flavorful, one of the best I've had in 50 years of eating friend rice.  The dumplings were excellent.  The standouts were the edamame, shrimp, and the small soup ones.  Service was pleasant and efficient."

J. B.,/user_details?userid=Umh6KtlsYr_lAWl4nS_9-g,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA",6/19/2021,2,"The ambiance is nice, but I'm afraid I will never go back. I ate here tonight and got so sick. I've been throwing up since leaving the restaurant, and I haven't thrown up in years. I think something was very off with the crab fried rice (which had very little crab other than a piece on top). Perhaps the rice had eggs even though they told me it didn't. Same for the shrimp dumplings. We enjoyed the black pepper beef, but everything else is kind of off. The shrimp noodles were bland, overcooked and there was some kind of vegetable in it that was tough and inedible. If you are looking to have the incredible pictures that you see online you have to specially request the room with the chandeliers. We didn't realize the other part of the restaurant does not have that same look so we did not get our preferred seating for a birthday celebration. This was a splurge in terms of the price for a dinner for two, but was an epic fail!"

Place is stunning. Impressed by main room which looks like Masonic lodge. Prices are a little higher than average. Drinks are pricey but very strong which is good for me. Loved coconut shrimps for appetizer and chargrilled fillet of beef for main dish. Service is fast and professional. I recommend.

Definitely recommend the rock shrimp and chow fun.. Fried rice was too eggy for my liking. Great staff, beautiful decor indoors, and high ceilings."

Lovely L.,/user_details?userid=r_vr6UQ_eoITu3e0y-cHFA,"Arcadia, CA",3/1/2020,2,"My friends and i traveled to New York to explore the city and eat amazing food! One of my girlfriends found this restaurant and really wanted to try it so 10 of us arrived on Sunday night to devour some delicious entrees. We all ordered different items but the one thing most of them had in common was; it was all too salty. Some of us tried to finish what we ordered anyways because we were hungry meanwhile some of the entrees were just left alone. I had the Kung pao monkfish and it was dry and salty. The black cod was salty. The pad see ew was salty. The orange shrimp was salty. My bf spoke up and told one of the servers that most of the entrees were really salty. We weren't looking for free meals but more so to let the chefs know that there was too much salt. The server said to us ""oh, i don't think there's a lot of salt used but maybe it's just something you're not use to."" 10 of us are Asian ... who traveled here from Orange County and Los Angeles. We are use to eating Asian food. We grew up eating it. We eat it all day at home. The only good thing i had was the duck salad with poached egg. It was vinegary with crispy duck pieces in it. So good! But that was it."

I made a reservation in advance for early dinner but they had me wait for 40min even though my table was ready as well as six other tables around us - I don't like this attitude.

Food is decent but not super amazing. We got a whole fish for $38 I think was the best deal on menu. Dim sum is very so so...Other stuff are just OK. Probably you can get tastier Chinese food elsewhere and pay less. I guess it's a good experience we paid for.
Niyati T.,/user_details?userid=S3rDjbzraFEXA4VLhfa7CA,"New York, NY",11/5/2017,5,"After many people told me about this place I had to try it. It is so good. Being a vegetarian, I always struggle to find good stuff on the menu at a nice ambiance like this in NYC. Their menu is vegetarian friendly, we had their edamame dumplings for appetizer and noodles as a main course and both were really good. We finished it off with their Chocolate three colors for dessert. Fantastic experience, definitely going back to try more on their menu."

Their lychee martinis are amazing and overall our experience was great, the service was awesome, but I gave 4 stars because I wasnt 100% satisfied with the chicken dishes we ordered. If I was to pick between Tao or Buddakan I would definitely pick Tao. I don't mind coming back to give it a second chance though! Definitely recommend people to dine here at least once."

The food was delicious and was wonderfully presented. The waitstaff was extremely attentive and professional. One of the waiters in the waiting area was short and rude with us, as if we were bothering him because it took us more than 10 seconds to order a drink. Small portions. So order more than you usually would because you'll still be hungry. Amazing lemgrass mint drink. Chili rock shrimp will melt in your mouth, dim sum app . Chinese sausage fried rice needed some seasoning and the green beans were average."

Love the table in the middle with high ceiling and nice chandeliers. The service was okay. Waitress wasn't friendly but she wasn't rude either. We ordered several dishes and the spicy tuna tartar spring roll and crab and lobster shumai were very good. We ordered mushroom chow fun and was very disappointed with the display and the taste. Too salty! Nothing special. I wouldn't go to this restaurant again but its nice to check it out once for their ambiance.

Sara C.,/user_details?userid=pWgE89g5Tj4m2sDIKYPGng,"Roanoke, TX",7/15/2019,5,"I just love this place so much. It's become a NY staple every time I visit, I have to go. The vibe is super sexy and trendy. It's a great place for a date night, but I've taken my 7 year old with me the last two times, and he's managed to find something he likes. It's just a great experience. I always get the ""smoke"" cocktail if you're a mezcal lover. My personal faves on the menu are the edamame dumplings, short ribs, the mushroom lo mein, vegetarian fried rice (seriously I've gotta recreate this one at home), and we had a couple fantastic veggie dishes since my sister doesn't eat meat. It's family style, which is fun because you get to try so many things! Pro tip: go on an off night where it isn't busy and ask for a tour. It's a stunning location and each ""room"" is special. Our server was kind enough to offer one to us, and it was really neat."

We were a group of five and in addition to that we ordered the lamb chops, sea bass, beef, Cantonese egg rolls (had to order twice because they were so delicious!), vegetable fried rice, a side of greens, and the scallion short rib pancakes. Everything was superb. They even brought out the crying chocolate dessert with a candle and ""congratulations,"" which was super cute. Everything from the food, decor, and drinks were memorable enough to make me look forward to dining here again."

J. Karim A.,/user_details?userid=2eN4NRcL3b3mTqGktCpysg,"New York, NY",5/21/2018,3,"Usually I love Buddakan. This time we were a group of 5. Had to wait a bit for our table which is common. Even though they threaten to only give you 15min wait if you're late before losing your table. So it's fine for them to be late. But not you. And they're unapologetic about it. That being said, we had a great table and friendly server. We did the tasting menu. It was fine but not as good as usual. The edamame dumplings are a hit. But everything else seemed phoned in. That being said, I enjoyed the desserts, especially the chocolate ones."

Adam M.,/user_details?userid=Uw7fvL8L7ltKvpIHTO_oQw,"Manhattan, NY",8/16/2018,2,Not the Buddakan I once knew. They can't handle a table larger than 5 people. We came as a group and they couldn't fit us at the table. We told them the amount of us and the gave us a table too small and then told us to wait if we wanted another table they can fit the RESERVED party... The service was slow as a turtle. I have no idea how long I waited between the main course and appetizers. It felt like eternity. This place was once glam and lavish and now is just like a frathouse with wait staff. Smh. Still can't believe they couldn't fit at the table. Utterly disrespectful.

Last year's NYE had hats and decorations for the count down but didn't this year for some reason. Would've been nice but not a deal breaker because the food and drinks are still up to par and the edamame dumplings are like no other and a must try if you dine here! I got the lychee martini and it was perfect as well in addition to the rock shrimp I ordered. It was first come first serve seating again this year and even though they were packed around 9:30pm, there were still opportunities to grab a table, which was perfect for those who get late night starts and don't want to feel trapped with a dinner reservation on New Years Eve in case your plans change. Service was still good through the NYE chaos and we were able to leave around 10:45pm to make it across the street to meet with friends. This is definitely a nice, trendy, upscale place to hit up for dinner, drinks and good music."

Minnie V.,/user_details?userid=9vVMkyGIrAzme1hoZwsP0w,"Queens, Queens, NY",8/30/2019,1,This was the worst experience ever on my birthday yesterday. I sat at the large table in the middle. The lady that served us kept repeating how the stuff is expensive and so we allowed her to know that was not a problem because it's my birthday. She took 20 minutes to return with anything we asked for. She sent me the wrong drink and I asked for the one I asked for and she decided to place my bill and ask me to leave. After placing the bill she never returned and when I spoke to the manager about my experience she did nothing to even make me feel comfortable at least. The most uncomfortable experience on my birthday.

When we arrived there is a wonderful waiting area with a full service bar. We were seated quickly in the ""library"" which is downstairs and a lot more quiet than some of the other areas. The waitress was amazing. I wish I remember her name. She was very attentive and provided great recommendations for drinks and food. The manager even brought us glasses of champagne for our celebration. We had oxtail dim sum and short rib pancakes for appetizers. The appetizers are small but filling. I'd say one appetizer per person or 2 appetizer to share. For dinner we had the cod, short rib, and pineapple fried rice. Seriously life changing food. It did not disappoint and the fish melts in your mouth like butter. For dessert we had a cherry chocolate cremoso and the most amazing carrot cake! Please go here! It will not disappoint!"

Small is 40cm wide and 20cm high... Inside fabolus, yes expensive, like everything else that is good in New York, but soo much better and worth the money compared to f.x. The View. Very big maybe 300seats, but does not feel big. Awesome good food and quite fast served after we ordered."
Tasheena S.,/user_details?userid=JUjphHOR3SgXeDilnTxg3A,"New York, NY",12/28/2018,5,"This restaurant has exceptional decor, great music, excellent service, and very good food. The items I ate in order  of preference were the cauliflower lollipops (does not taste like cauliflower, more similar to an arrancini), general tso's soup dumplings, oxtail dumplings, minced pork lo mein, carrot dumplings, and short rib scallion pancake (worst item ordered, not like your traditional scallion pancake and short rib had flavor but was disappointing compared to the oxtail). Definitely a good place to go for a girls' night or for a date. Prices are a steal for the quality and presentation of food in addition to the environment and service. Five Stars!"
Nupur N.,/user_details?userid=v4JgPjYbD03sOAcCbqW2kQ,"Toronto, Canada",4/7/2016,4,"I absolutely love this place! Right from the food to the ambiance, everything was great! I came here for my birthday and I was not disappointed. The cocktails were well made and the chilli rock shrimp was on point! I also got the minced pork lo mein which was amazing. Definitely recommend this place!"

The food is always delicious and the atmosphere is so grand and beautiful. My favorite dishes are the chili rock shrimp, peeking duck, oxtail dumplings, and Chinese fried rice. It is definitely a little pricey and noisy but overall I really enjoy eating dinner here."
Kay L.,/user_details?userid=NlZvnZhS3USKo4co7GLH8Q,"La Crescenta, CA",6/11/2016,3,Very nice place. It's in the heart of all the action. The restaurant itself was very nice. Dim lit. Great place for dinner. The decor was pretty rad. The service was good too. The food was very taste and also cute for pictures. The carrots dumplings were so cute but very very sweet. The mushroom chow fun was really tasty. I also got the char broccoli and it was absolutely disgusting. Worst thing I've ever tasted in my life. Want to vomit just thinking about it. But everything was fun. Coffee ice cream was amazing!!
Alana D.,/user_details?userid=wG7eG5Wp7xwceWGrn2P-lg,"Queens Village, NY",9/21/2018,4,"Went here with my boyfriend and a good friend. We had an amazing time! The food was great and the atmosphere was as well. It was becoming a busy Friday night when we entered without a reservation but we were still seated promptly. We wanted to be out of the box with our food so we ordered a whole bunch of different things. What stood out to me the most were the oxtail dumplings. They really were to die for!!! Our waitress was very helpful in regards to suggestions of food and even drink. It definitely was very pricey but overall, I had an amazing time!"

Maitre D kept pushing me out of the way. Then hands me the bag with no apology or thank you. Just snobby. I'll never pick up from there again.
Akash V.,/user_details?userid=LBnKnIZlTiunS5mIgJfsMA,"Far Rockaway, Queens, NY",9/18/2018,5,Such a beautiful setting. Gothic and elegant all in one. The food is amazing and must try everything on the menu. Just a wonderful experience

My friend had her birthday dinner here so 4/5 decided to go with the chef's menu #2 and they weren't disappointed in the slightest. They were able to try many of the most popular items and LOVED all of them. Since I'm vegetarian, I tried all the veggie options (took A LOT home because I over-ordered) but the carrot dumplings and smoked  tofu options were my favorite. This restaurant has a great vibe, attentive servers and delicious food."

We ordered the dim sum for two and the Peking duck along with some yummy cocktails. Food came out fast and was delicious - just amazing. Will definitely go back if I return to New York."

We knew this was a hot spot thanks to sexy in the city episodes from long ago but it still lives up to the hype. Portions were generous and every bite was better than the last. Love the chili rock shrimp app and the potstickers... best I ever had. We shared the peppered beef and a chicken dish and rice and green beans.... PLENTY of food for 3 and the rice with the curry and pineapple... I'll be dreaming of that for years. Topped off the event with the malted lava cake with coffee ice cream and although we were stuffed at this point not a drop was left. The mood, music and decor is simple Swanky and so very ""sex in this city!"

They have a waiting area with a bar and tables where you can order food which really helps b/c there can be long wait times for walk-ins. The drinks are on the expensive side but they are really good. The oxtail dumplings are a 10 the general tsos ehh not so much. I expected them to be better than your typical general tsos they were about the same. Entrees r really good too but when you consider you have to order a noodle or rice they seem a little overpriced.

I loved the food here. The edamame dumplings that everyone was raving about were good, but they weren't exactly something I would order multiple times. The dumplings had creamy, mashed edamame beans inside - definitely nothing like I expected. Rock shrimp was very good but a little bit too salty. Lobster egg rolls were OK. Boneless spare ribs were good. Lobster fried rice was really good. Birthday dessert was very cute."

They didn't make a deal and just told us to let them know when my party was all here.  The waiter was very helpful in explaining the menu to everyone. The pre fixed menu is perfect for a large group. I had about 12 people and they brought so much food out!  We couldn't even finish it  all and had doggy bags to take home! And the place and ambiance is beautiful! You have to talk a little louder because of the music but overall i had a great time for my birthday!  I would defintely come back!

Duck salad sensational and beef pancake. Appetizers each enough to share a generous portion.  We also shared the blackened cod. Delicious.   And pear with sorbet dish for desert.  All in all one of the best meals ever.   You must try it. I'll be back"

Eli M.,/user_details?userid=MVMxog_5-Y47UuCBaF6dpg,"Charlotte, NC",11/3/2017,1,"Worst service ever!!! First, the front of house was mean and did not help us find our table. We were meeting people and she told us the wrong reservation. She Was not helpful until I corrected her and told her the first name, which she never asked for. Then, our server was rude and disrespectful to our table. Tried to rush us out of the restaurant, instead of trying to help us enjoy our experience. She was very fake and I would recommend she take some kind of seminar on people skills. The rest of the staff was somewhat kind but mostly rude. Throwing dishes on our table, and trying to rush us out. I've worked in restaurants for years and I know customer service. THIS IS NOT IT!!!!  No one should go to this restaurant unless you want to be treated like nothing!!!"

The lights were so dim that I couldn't see anything or even the person sitting next to me. This place doesn't serve authentic Chinese food either. And the fake Chinese food here is also ridiculously expensive. So if you're Chinese and are looking for authentic Chinese food, you should definitely avoid this place."
Brendon S.,/user_details?userid=BDBveUb4qBr_B2AXVymIBw,"Brooklyn, NY",2/20/2019,5,Been here a few times great place for a date or a large party 4 or more you can do the special tasting menu which has three versions the second version is likely my favorite and would be the best choice for your money as it's about $85-$95 per person and has about 12-13 courses which includes dessert but no drinks and a standard 2 person date wouldn't likely run you around $200 or more alone and most of the dishes are considered shareable so they will be served center of the table even for a party of 2... the place looks amazing very low light so it will effect your picture taking.. most recent visit had the filet of beef along with spring rolls and for dessert had the chocolate pistachio cremoso the main room downstairs looks fantastic especially from the top of the staircase.. the portion size varies and could leave you wanting for more depending on the dish filet of beef was delicious however portion is very small but considered shareable and at $41 between 2 people it would be around 3 pieces each per person which is not very filling.. all in all I would definitely recommend going it's worth the experience alone and the food is good

Decor is beautiful. Highly highly highly recommend the Peking duck, general tsao dumplings, sweet and crispy jumbo shrimp, crab sticky rice, and the short rib with mushroom chow fun. My fiancé loved the black cod and the others at the table loved the Charred Filet Of Beef. I mean, it was all spectacular but those dishes stood out the most for me. Especially the duck. I can't wait to come back for my birthday. I've been twice, both times excellent. First time ordered a la carte, second time tried the tasting menu. Definitely preferred the tasting menu, it's pricey but I was able to eat and rest so much more food."

Johanna T.,/user_details?userid=gouslNcYNpgBib9GBLVpcw,"New York, NY",4/12/2016,3,"We loved the foie gras and chicken dumplings, but despite ordering those dumplings, the edamame dumplings, the dim sum sampler, the peking duck, a chicken entree, and noodles, that was the only outstanding dish. Everything was good, but perhaps my expectations were set too high before coming. A great place for a nice dinner, especially because it's a large space and still feels intimate, but I can't say this tops any NY restaurant list of mine...except maybe if I only came for drinks and the chicken dumplings."

Kayisha T.,/user_details?userid=HP7GnoBXZVUE2HloU0lnJw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/3/2016,4,"The ambiance is priceless. One can't describe the beauty of the decor you must see it yourself. Unfortunately I arrived late as I had to drive slow with the birthday girl custom cake.  I wasn't there when the dinner party decided on family style $70.00 each which came to a whooping $106 each. I don't like that I didn't have a choice given my shellfish allergy and I had weight loss surgery. I wasn't allowed to order a dish. The food is delicious. Now, when we wanted to cut the cake it was an additional $50.00 now family style included dessert so why charge additional fees. You would charge us for not eating your desserts that we paid for. We decided to cut the cake at the next venue."

He mentioned he has been with the place since day one. He made our experience that much more amazing. Came here for a team dinner. Started off with the dim sum ~ edamame dumplings which was mushy is consistency. The smoked salmon dumplings were crisp to perfection and a big hit at our table. The tuna tartare spring rolls were fresh but the chili  rock shrimp stole the show. It had just enough heat with packing flavor making it irresistible. We continued onto to our entrees which we all did family style. We ordered the whole sea bass, Peking dick for two, crab sticky rice, and the glazed Alaskan Black cod. By far the cod was a must have. Everything on that plate was cooked to perfection. Overall the experience was very good. This place is highly recommended."

Rock shrimp and two desserts (chocolate and the almond bread pudding with whiskey ice cream). What an experience. Will definitely be back."

I wanted to take my girl to a nice a dinner and it definitely met expectations. We had the ""chilli rock shrimp"" to start and I would not recommend it, It tasted great however the entrées where much better. The charbroiled steak and cod were amazing. Bottom line is come to this place for the vibe, food is great however you can find better if you try. I gave 4 stars because I genuinely feel like this place is worth every penny."

Melissa C.,/user_details?userid=R47jWQmSIwQxiZF5Z8OOSA,"Gaithersburg, MD",3/12/2017,5,My FAV restaurant of all time!! I first dined here for my 19th birthday which was such an amazing dining experience. And have been going back ever since. I recently went for my 23rd birthday with some friends and they fell in love with the place too! Again everything was spectacular. The food was amazing! Our waiter was great! And the music they had playing that night made it even more fun. 10/10 would DEFINITELY recommend. The sausage rice and any dumplings are my go tos at Buddakan.

How can you beat the absurd decor and yummy dishes? I die for the ginger sugar crusted lamb chops. While we love the food, can't say that the cocktails are strong or worth $17 a pop. This would be our only detractor."
Alina L.,/user_details?userid=WhDX8eWFlSH5xZTD0sFXVg,"Miami, FL",6/21/2018,5,"WOW what can I say!??? edamame dumplings are the best appetizer!!! sometimes we even order more! The tranquility and haze cocktails are out of this world. You can taste every fresh ingredient in those drinks!!! the rice and sushi and mushroom soup they have are extraordinary. Everything... simply everything on that menu is amazing and you can't go wrong with what you choose! Get there early (as soon as they open) or schedule your visit WAAAAAY in advance! make your reservation at least 1-2 months in advance and if you forget, just show up 10 minutes before they open and sit at the bar and ask to sit at a table and they will accommodate!"

Nicolette G.,/user_details?userid=fe36OsmWkZ6-sdnOMb19ow,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",2/16/2019,5,"Went here for a late valentine's day dinner with my boyfriend & we already made plans to go back again. The ambiance was great!! The food is EXCELLENT. The staff is SOOO nice - our waitress was super friendly, funny and attentive. When we ordered she gave us a run down of all the dishes so we knew what we were getting Incase we wanted to change our minds (some of the dishes we ordered has a lot of noodles in addition to the side dish of noodles we ordered). At one point the manager came over and started talking to us and he was so sweet - he even gave us complimentary champagne at the end of our meal! (Thank you Travis!). They also didn't rush us at all. I feel like most restaurants bring our course after course and you feel so full or they get annoyed when you don't order everything at once, but the staff here was almost encouraging taking your time and each course came out at a nice pace which gave us time to digest and we didn't feel grossly full after eating. All of the dishes are family style (gets served to the center of the table) which i likes because my boyfriend and i usually end up splitting whatever we get - this just made it easier :). Highly recommend getting a few dim sums to start (they have a dim sum tasting menu and I'm kind of regretting not getting it). Overall, GREAT EXPERIENCE. I really could just keep going on about how nice the staff was, it really blew my mind."

My wife and I have been here some years back and had a great experience and thought why not take the kids.I won't go through the various menu items we had. Ask were very good and thus is a great restaurant to try some things you otherwise wouldn't. We got to expand our kids palettes pretty good with some things they haven't tried. We also splurged for a couple of desserts which we also delicious. Take a look at the video and you'll see their reaction. All in all, this restaurant is a great experience. Great, unique good, good service and an enchanting environment. Not to be missed as a couple, but good for the family as well."

After dinner, we were planning to order dessert, the waitress took forever to deliver our dessert menu. After we received the dessert menu, we didn't see our waitress for approx 6-7 min. By that time, we were irritated of this waiting game so we waived down another staff member who was walking passed our table & asked for our bill (the bill came immediately of course). Would come back for drinks at the bar only."

The customer service was decent and the food was pretty good. There was no light whatsoever in the whole entire restaurant and it was very dark. I had to use a flashlight to look at my menu. There is a single bathroom on each floor and I waited twenty minutes to go to the bathroom. We had to order multiple orders of each plate because there is only one to three pieces on each serving. If you're looking for a place to eat that has great food for great prices I would not recommend Buddakan. If you want a family experience to talk to friends, this could be an available option."

Cocktails hit the spot. I love the Fate! Food was real tasty and the right amount of spice. Ambience is wonderful, but was seated in a room where the tables were too close together, and even if there wasn't that many people- me and my girlfriend were ear to ear with a couple! We had spring rolls, chili rock shrimp, fried rice with coconut sauce, and Edamame dumplings! Server was also an attentive and a sweet guy."

We ordered the general tso dim sum, Kung pao monkfish, charred filet and wild mushroom chow fun. Each dish was delicious. My favorite was the monkfish. I would highly recommend it. In general, it is a really nice Asian restaurant but the food did not blow me away. I've had better Chinese food in Chinatown."

I would advice to choose mainly from their appetizers/dim-sum menu as it's more original than the rest of the carte. (Oxtail dumplings, crab-lobster shumai, shortrib pancakes,yumm!) - a little minus for the prawn noddle dish who was too salty."

If it's ambiance you want, they have it. The lounge is beautiful and modern. There are two main dining rooms first and second floor. The second floor is large with beautiful chandeliers. The first floor is decorated in a modern sexy Asian fusion. The food and service was outstanding. It's a pricy restaurant for Asian food. It's more of an experience for a special occasion or a first date. Not your everyday Chinese or Asian restaurant. The service was great and attentive. Our waiter was amazing. We did not want dessert as we were full and not really into sweets. He brought us a complimentary dessert teaser, it was my BD. Highly recommend if you want the experience."

The plates are designed for you to share or eat individually. I went with my sister and we ordered one appetizer, two entrees, and a side which was enough for us. I recommend trying any dumpling because they are packed with flavor. We both ordered the chili chicken and let me tell you the sauce was out of this world and the chicken tasted like butter.

Our reservations were for 8:15, but we did not get seated til about 8:40. I know some nights are busy and people try their best, but after having to wait while having a reservation I was not the happiest. When it came time to order I was very interested in some items on the menu, but when they came I was not very pleased. One thing I can say is my waiter was divine. He came to the table and was very interested in my families lives and we were able to ha e a very nice conversation.  Overall, this was not my favorite."

Go to bar and order a cocktail if you want a drink. Dumplings delicious. The charred steak was tender and flavorful. The Dungeness crab rice a must.   tables are too close and patrons getting in and out are going to bump the next table if you are along the wall downstairs . Noisy.

This restaurant is a diamond in the meatpacking district! I highly recommend this restaurant for any birthday celebrations or romantic get-togethers... It's just perfect! The food was delicious. The service was outstanding from the doorman, reservations desk, lounge area while you wait for your table. And than the server/staffer! The service and the food was just flawless."

From the outside you can easily walk right past it and not have a clue there is even a restaurant on the inside of the wall. I highly recommend!

Starting with appetizers we order the pork pot stickers, oxtail dumpling, king crab and lobster Sui Mai, general tso, and one more thing I can't really remember but all 4 were absolutely delicious. The oxtail dumpling is a must try for sure though. Next we order for our main course the shrimp and lobster chow fun, lobster fried rice, crab sticky rice, broken chili chicken, lamb, chops and, beef with chow fun. For 4 people that was a good amount of food. We all left quite satisfied. The pricing for the restaurant is expensive but the service is outstanding. They changed our plates regularly, refilled our water often, checked up on us. If it wasn't for the price I would definitely come here more often."

The food was impeccable and the service and ambiance was great. I highly recommend Buddakan for any special events or just a quick bite with a friend.
Cynthia M G.,/user_details?userid=64AZszZLj5MmmqneamBwEw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12/19/2018,5,Very elegant and touristy. I came here for a friend's birthday party. She was turning 50 and it was a nice sized celebration. 50 guests. I had some wine and a nice fish dinner. Did not try the appetizers because the prices were so high that we just went straight for entrees.
Emmett D.,/user_details?userid=8jeCMLwh0nmXmjqeuBEnog,"Arabi, LA",8/11/2018,5,My go to NYC spot when I'm there. Everything ion the menu is delicious. From when you first walk in the front door to realize how incredible the space is. The bar scene is very hip and vibrant. When eating I always ask for downstairs in one of the little sub rooms. Menu has something for everyone. A must see when in NYC

I think it has one of the best decor of New York restaurants. The food is always good but the service is truly hit or miss. It's always buys and I recommend a reservation and also order the general tso dumpling and the lobster egg rolls. Don't get the Dan Dan noodles ! They were gross and I wasn't the only one who thought so. My neighboring table did too. If you take a look at the photo I took of the dining room you may recognize the place from the engagement dinner of the movie Sex In the City. Check it out good place to eat and take a load off.

Checking in was easy we had a 9:30 reservation and we came in 15 earlier. We got sat down at 9:50. That was our only disappointment. We got sat down. Server was really nice and helped us with plates. Food came out quickly and portions where good. Recommend the lobster roll. And general tsos dumplings. Chicken was good as well as lobster rice and pork rice. Definitely recommended and definitely coming back soon.

We frequent ny and are sometimes disappointed in the service, as we are not famous, nor uber rich. However, buddakan didn't seem to mind. The food was amazing and surprisingly quick. Overall I have come to expect disappointment when it comes to super popular restaurants but this is an exception. It deserves all the high praise it receives!"

Amy C.,/user_details?userid=HQ1iBRQX9NNM3PaqUIfgOg,"Flushing, NY",5/5/2015,5,"This place is absolutely amazing. An upscale eatery at most. The ambiance and decor is very modern however authentic. I made reservations and upon arrival was quickly seated in the lower level of the restaurant. Omg is this place romantic. Upon the suggestion of our waiter, we ordered the jade shrimp dumplings as an appetizer. They were oh so delicious. Then for the entree, we decided to share the short ribs with noodles and a side of vegetables, the asian green stir fry. The short ribs were absolutely amazing, so tender, juicy and well seasoned. As for the vegetables and noodles, they were cooked to perfection. It was an amazing dinner. However, we did not stop there. We decided to order dessert. Omg the passion fruit merengue was amazing. So delicious not too sweet and just enough to share. I loved my whole experience. A night to remember."

Tina T.,/user_details?userid=AJLqxKPlqA8XmkWJT5T0Iw,"New York, NY",9/30/2017,4,"The place has great decor, it's one of those fancy chinese restaurants that have tastefully sleek Asian decor. I mean don't get me wrong I had a great dinner, the music was not loud and my friends and I had good conversation, service was solid. But wow you really pay for where you're eating at. I guess it's cause I'm Asian but paying for expensive fried rice or dumplings really hurts me some type of way. But at least it was still good! I would recommend this place if you wanted asian food but wanted somewhere like obviously flashier"

I wasn't seated near them, but they were pretty legless and loud so I could keep tabs on them from a distance. One of the girls hurled in the bathroom but the staff seemed quick to clean it up.

We had a fabulous time from food to service,thanks Kristen. My man has been to the Buddakhan in Atlantic city and he loves the food by far here. From the edamame dumplings to my fav scallops. We will b back since we basically almost live in the city...."
Stephanie G.,/user_details?userid=WU3ImaespusxxBHyTp3qmg,"Miami, FL",9/21/2009,5,"We held a birthday dinner at Buddakan this past weekend and could not have been more pleased with the experience. The staff was courteous and wonderfully accommodating to our large group. I ordered a birthday cake several weeks before as a surprise, and it was handled beautifully. The price of the cake was relatively inexpensive but was worth every penny as it was moist and decadent. I'd been to Buddakan once before several years ago, but was left with such a great impression that I was eager to share it with my friends. Buddakan is lovely on the inside, and the food is even better. Most notable were the edamame dumplings which melt in your mouth and the sweet & sour chicken. I'd absolutely recommend Buddakan to anyone looking for a pleasurable dining experience in the city. Just don't forget to try the edamame dumplings!"

Charred beef for sure!  Desserts are amazing.  Wonderful service, very attentive.  You just won't be disappointed!"

The prices are not bad and they really try to accommodate any food allergies you may have (my good friend has them All). It does get crowded so make a reservation.

Much to my surprise, it was the first thing the waiter asked, and although we were eating off the ""taster"" menu, they were able to adapt what they could to suit my needs. They brought out additional dishes when there were no options, and walked me through the menu. Regularly checking up to make sure I was okay. The food was delicious, and I would definitely come back again. 5 stars for service, and for flavor."

Jennifer O.,/user_details?userid=Eh7wi0WJUtbhBL1AxvEJ8w,"Santa Ana, CA",11/27/2016,5,"Came here with a group of seven people so we opted for the Tasting Menu 2. I loved every single thing they served us and it was more than enough food! You're also allowed to switch out dishes on the tasting menu if you prefer something else. The only thing we switch out was the fish for the scallops, which I don't regret. The scallops were on point. The interior is absolutely beautiful and I also had a couple cocktails before being seated as well as during and they were also all really tasty. I had the 'clarity' cocktail which I liked. It was sweet but not too much. Had a good balance. I tried a sip of the royal which I thought tasted too much like candy. I also ordered the Haze cocktail (lychee martini) which isn't on the menu anymore but you can still order it. It was definitely a much stronger drink, but delicious as well. If you're part of a big group I definitely recommend going for the tasting menu option. It gives you the chance to sample everything and they make sure there's enough portions for everyone. The service was also top-notch as would be expected. Definitely hope to come back here on my next NYC venture."

We had a flawless experience. The service was top-notch and the food was exceptional. Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious. We tried several dim sum options (shrimp dumplings and shrimp/lobster shumai and tuna tartar spring roll) and the dumplings were extraordinary. The arctic sea bass was melt-in-your mouth delicious. We also tried a fried rice and a noodle dish and both were fantastic. They even surprised my daughter with a scoop of caramel soy ice cream and a hand-painted birthday cookie. Highly recommend; absolutely delicious."
Daniel P.,/user_details?userid=6l6NkWa0AKGZezIMofoVFw,"Parker, CO",3/5/2016,4,Food very good. Service good. Prices eehhhh.

Nope S.,/user_details?userid=pQD0yqJFcOkFDCMkPbXARA,"Los Angeles, CA",2/28/2015,5,"Such a sexy, sleek, mysterious looking lounge & restaurant Utterly gorgeous inside. No wonder Sex & the City used this place to film for Carries rehearsal dinner.. A great place to grab drinks, and a snack. Although we came for dinner we did return again on our last day in NY for their amazing pork belly bao buns they were that amazing melt in your mouth goodness.  Sesame shrimp toast were a nice little tapas plate to get crunchy & filling. Basically this isn't your authentic Asian place in NY. It's an Asian fusion at it's best. Really enjoyed the Fate cocktail which consisted of bubbly Prosecco, Pineapple juice, & elderflower liquor."

Portions are very small I must say. The entrees come with no sides , hence the small portion. The waiters are attentive , staff is friendly and service is excellent .

Michael M.,/user_details?userid=bDK71D_sqLALvwUVPROZpw,"New York, NY",11/9/2017,3,"Been patrons since it opened and it's one of our neighborhood favorites but Buddakan has unfortunately scummed to testing the limits of the price-to-value-to-popularity calculus. Great service, ambiance and cuisine but the price of food and wine is no longer sustainable in any sensible or competitive context. Delivering far too little for way too much money, they've carefully optimized profit margins on every single selection. Great while it lasted, but like a girlfriend that just keeps getting more expensive, at some point you just don't want to be taken advantage of anymore, so we say goodbye Buddakan it was great while it lasted!"

I brought my mother here for mother's day with certainty and enthusiasm and we both left with confusion and disappointment. Service was the worst on mother's day. My mother and I were rushed to order and rushed to eat. This was disturbing as rushing paying customers on a valuable holiday seemed to be the key goal of the restaurant in which everyone constantly remind us that we needed to hurry. I made reservations for 3:00pm. I arrived at 3:10 and my mother at 3:30. It was nice of them to let me sit but at the front desk before being seated they told me that the kitchen closes at 3:15. I could understand if the kitchen closed at 4:00pm but having a 15 minute window to order makes no sense. I could not understand at the time why they'd have a 3:00 reservation available and such an inconsiderate amount of time to order. I should have walked out the door but it was pouring out and with my mothers love for Buddakan in AC, I stayed. I was seated and my server reminded me that the kitchen closes at 3:15. This was a consistent reminder. I was trying to surprise my mother by having her walk up to the location but instead had to ruin the experience, call her and read the menu. I was so humiliated when doing this because I wanted her to walk in and be surprised and it was ruined due to a kitchen closing at ""3:15"" when in fact the kitchen never closed at all. It was a lie and left me with tons of distrust for this restaurant. The food is beautifully presented yet cold, tasteless and strange. The best part of the meal was the server/manager allowed me to change my dish which the other dish was not more pleasing than the first but I would have felt bad having to sample the entire restaurant to find some flavor. I do appreciate the effort in presentation but we came here to eat the food so decorate it all you want, flavor is the wow factor in any dining situation. We had the lobster egg rolls, the pork potstickers, the black pepper beef, the short rib, the broken chili chicken, the crab fried rice, the wok tossed brocolli and the crying chocolate for dessert. The crying chocolate was delicious! I absolutely loved it, as I did in AC, rich in chocolate and enough to share. The lobster egg rolls, shareable sized appetizer with nice flavor, was served piping hot and delicious. My main complaint is how much cartilage I was pulling out of my mouth while eating it. This showed carelessness in the preparation. It's irresponsible to have that in a dish like an egg roll. No one want to pull anything out of their mouth so I was annoyed by that. The potstickers had a nice flavor and was cooked nicely. The sauces presented with the dish were also nice. The crab fried rice was delicious and rich in crab but was served at room temperature. Everything goes downhill from here. The black pepper beef is a waste of a rib eye. There was no other flavor except black pepper and it was served at room temperature. This dish was cold, bland and inedible. I had this sent back and opted for the broken chili chicken instead, a fried chicken breast, nicely fried but flavorless, in a vinegar like sauce. It was colorful but nothing said chili about this dish. In fact, I didnt see a chili in sight but I did not want to further ruin dinner for my mom by ordering anything else so I ate it and smiled. They removed this from the bill without me asking so that was nice but I was still had to eat it. The shortrib was cooked beautifully but had no flavor at all. None. It was just cooked. The wok charred broccoli was served cold the first time so they had to make us a new one, hence why I said the kitchen never closed. When it came out hot it was okay, nothing phenomenal. This was also removed from the bill without us asking. The drinks were okay. Fate was excellent and expertly made and so was the smoked margarita in my opinion but my mother wanted something simpler. She ordered a regular margarita and it was awful. When we asked to change it, it did not taste any better. It isn't safe to order drinks off the menu, even though they have a full bar. Stick with the menu or drink somewhere else. I know that this is a hearty review but I want you to know how inconsistent this restaurant has been. You wont get an experience that lives up to the decor. You won't get a hot meal or one bursting with flavor. Ordering off the menu drinks are a waste of money and a waste of them having a full bar. How hard is it to make a drinkable margarita? You will be rushed as a paying customer. No one cares about the money spent on mom, only the experience and she was robbed of that. If you want anything other than a good app or a sweet treat, go somewhere else. This is not the place to enjoy a thorough dining experience. 1 star for the server smiling and asking how everything is going. One star for good apps and a decent fate."

Christine K.,/user_details?userid=rC8P-8U4iOPGMVp2OBASQA,"New York, NY",11/20/2016,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here--I had the lamb chops and tuna tartare egg rolls. The scene is definitely hip and vibrant, fitting for young couples or anyone with a heart of a 30-year-old. If you want to have a peaceful conversation, Buddakan may not be your optimal choice for dinner. On another note, if you're seeking fun and wanting to enjoy a few drinks, Buddakan satisfies both. I do want to return to try the edamame dumplings though! (Be sure to make reservations before you come here!)"
Chloé R.,/user_details?userid=66Szq2Pe2AfhZjTtyHttlQ,"New York, NY",5/29/2017,5,"The fate cocktail and general tso dumplings were awesome. The spicy chicken and the charred filet were good, and the wok tossed noodles were also good. The ambience is pretty great. Were able to snag a table by the bar without a reservation. The main dining room downstairs is gorgeous, like from the sex and the city movie but there aren't too many tables there. Lots of tables surrounding that opulent Harry Potter like room. Much better than Tao down the street as far as food goes"

Nicole V.,/user_details?userid=_ycDc3PY49Qc73BB9HeiBw,"Staten Island, NY",3/1/2018,5,Definitely the place to go for a birthday. We tried the tasting menu because we went with a party of 10 and we saved a lot of money. (Not to say we didn't spend A LOT....because we did but the food was worth it). Amazing food and service. Will definitely be going back. (Way better than the arrogance of Tao employees).
Zachary L.,/user_details?userid=6PWEfi1PyqsfH0meiumQ4A,"Queens, Queens, NY",10/26/2019,5,"One of the better Asian fusion places in the city.

Zoe B.,/user_details?userid=mvisWxzQYS27qKKCT2gNew,"Westbury, NY",3/26/2017,3,"It's not great and it's fairly expensive. The price point isn't ridiculous but I don't think the food is exactly worth it. Just to give you perspective, if you order a jumbo shrimp entree you'll pay over $30 and you'll get 5 large shrimp on a plate, nothing else. If you want rice you'll have to order that separately but they explain it to you so you won't order an entree alone and end up surprised. If you're tempted to get the dim sum sampler for 2, I'd say it isn't worth it. It really is just a sample and nothing to supplement your meal. For example, the spring roll it comes with is one mini spring roll cut in half and it's not that great. I'd recommend just getting two separate full appetizers that are good. Jade shrimp and general tso's dumplings are good, Dungeness crab toast is good as well. Overall I wouldn't recommend the food but the service was good and it wasn't a bad experience; if you want to try this place out go for it. I've always wanted to try this place and now I have but I'll probably never choose to go back. The only thing I really didn't like was that they brought out all of our food; appetizers and entrees together so our table was really, really crowded and our entrees weren't hot by the time we got to them."

Definitely a great spot for drinks and dinner with friends or a romantic night out. We came with a big group of people so our menu was pre fix. I enjoyed a few of the dishes a lot. Such as the edamame wonton, short rib, and shrimp dishes. The desserts were yummy as well. However, the rest of the food wasn't very good at all. The noodle/sorbet/peanut sauce dish, cod dish, tar tar spring rolls had strange flavors and wasn't a big hit at the table at all. So everything felt like a hit or miss. The service was good. Plates changed out, water refilled, drink orders consistently taken. I would probably go back again but more for the vibe than the food."

I requested a nice table and instead got a table in between two parties. In top of that, I had to wait despite the fact that we made an reservation. The music was too loud we couldn't even have a conversation. Our server never came to check on us and it took 30 mins for our second entree to come out after the first entree. It took another 10 mins to get our check and left over wrapped up. This place is definitely overrated. Anniversary date ruined. Never coming back."

The service was impeccable.  My waitress Monica made my experience over the top. Monica our waitress was magnificent, she was very knowledgeable on the menu, enthusiastic and opinionated (a good thing). She is the reason why  giving this place 5 stars."

The place was packed, very nice decor, attentive hosts. Ordered the lobster egg rolls and chili rock shrimp for apps then had the deconstructed chili chicken, veggie fried rice and charred broccoli for main. The food was good but I was expecting much more given the high number of positive reviews. Service was very good though. Honestly think that Spice Market just down the street is more creative, better flavors/menu and better value."

For one, it's probably one of the largest venues. Tao is big, but buddakan feels more intimate. Tao is big and loud. Buddakan you can take a date and not have to lean over or whisper in each other's ear to have a conversation. It's in the heart of the meat packing so you have plenty of option post dinner as far as bars and nightlife. Food was truly great. Our server was unbelievable. Price was normal for this level of restaurant. I would definitely go back many more times, this place is a true classic."
Amber W.,/user_details?userid=uTB69FxOOMhHky13dqat7g,"McKinney, TX",10/8/2018,4,"Was visiting the city and made reservations for a Friday night. We were seated briefly after arriving and sat in a back room area. The entire restaurant is beautiful, the main dinning area is grand with a large table. They have a cute library bar area in the back with tables and the back area where we sat. The ambience is buzzing with energy from the music and has a very hip vibe. The cocktails were delicious I loved ""The Royal"" and felt the prices were reasonable. We enjoyed two appetizers to start, the tuna spring rolls and chili rock shrimp, both were very good. For entrees we both wanted a spicy dish so I chose the Ma La chicken and my husband the monk fish, for the side we got the lobster fried rice. The chicken was not spicy at all, but was still very tasty. My husband enjoyed his entree and we both loved the lobster fried rice. My only complaint about this place was the waitress, she was very friendly and started off strong, but we felt pressured to order everything at once. We made a comment to her about spacing the food out and she said oh yea, absolutely. Well we were still enjoying our rock shrimp appetizer and our entrees came out, it felt like she was trying to turn the table. I understand this is a busy place and New York City, but for the price we are paying for dinner, let us take our time."

We mentioned to management but they didn't offer us any kind of compensation, which they should have at a $36 price tag.  Service was sketchy, our waiter was very helpful, though. . It took two times for us to get something after we asked for it.  Line at bathroom was unacceptable. Won't return because of high prices and an imperfect experience."

Wasn't happy with the setup of the place. I like to people watch. I was put by the service area door, huge draft , people coming and going from back. No one puts Fox in a corner. The food was just okay. One standout was a tuna tartare spring roll. Very pricey, weird crowd. Also, so many children there for a Saturday night. Not a fan of kids when I'm spending $300 for a meal. The Fox won't be returning. Sorry ."

I would have just preferred a new candle but it must have some sort of meaning behind it.  Drinks were strong and not watered down at all.  Bill was over $200.00 and that included many dishes so it was well worth it."

Food was so tasteless. With this disappointment me and my friend came to Buddakan. The food was a wonderful combination with authentic Chinese food with creation. Such as their scallion pancake: the shredded beef on top was really Chinese soy sauce beef stew. Omg it's so good when I think of it I'm drooling again. Their edamame dumplings had truffle oil in it. The taste is so heavenly. Their crab sticky rice is a must try. It reminds me of the cartoon Chuka Ichiban lol

The food was good but I like my food with a hint of salt so I can actually taste the ingredients. Apps: lobster egg rolls, frozen, I've had better ones in Chinatown for $2. It's a basic shrimp roll with invisible pieces of lobster. Short rib scallion cake, fail, it tastes great separately but all together not so good. Minced meat on top of bread with hummus spread. Koreatown made me love scallion cakes and buddakan made me hate it. Entrées: lobster fried rice, bland but definitely balanced the salty green beans. Crab sticky rice is the best thing they serve. Chili chicken was good but not spicy at all. Dragon chicken was good, reminiscent of Peking duck. This place is not much better than Tao, at least they have the huge fortune cookie. I do appreciate that they do allow you to taste and will change it if you do not like the dish. But, I don't like to complain when someone is making my food outside of my vision.

He's hilarious, witty, attentive, personable and approachable. I hope the restaurant takes note of the value he brings to a diners experience. My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken dumpling and pork buns for the appetizer. For the entree we had the sizzling beef short rib and Chinese sausage rice. For dessert we went with Mochi Donuts. The short ribs is a MUST HAVE. It's boneless and simply melts in your mouth. It also comes with noodles and pears and the mix together is delightful. The appetizers and dessert were equally delectable. I'd come back for sure! The scenery of the restaurant is beautiful , the music isn't too loud either. I am an Analyst by nature and I have no complaints. The bartender in the waiting area was also very kind to us. Stop reading this review and go check it out!"

Food is served family style so I got to try plenty of dishes. Favorite dishes: Shrimp toast (appetizer), the Peking duck, black pepper beef (entree) and the crying chocolate cake (I think that's the name) (dessert). It is pricy but worth every penny. The service was also great, very attentive. Will definitely return!"

Simon C.,/user_details?userid=A8vGYI5El1LqDHQtRQLTNg,"East Brunswick, NJ",4/19/2017,4,"Came here for a wedding anniversary dinner. Had the hot Crab & Lobster Shumai and cold Tuna Tartare Spring Rolls as appetizers and Filet of Beef with mustard sauce,Cod with chili eggplant, and Chinese Sausage Fried Rice. Found all the dishes ""fusioned"" visually creative and palate wise adventurous, although a tad bit too salty for our taste. They also offered a free soy sauce based ice cream when they knew we were here for an anniversary celebration. The ambiance was also interesting and the place was pretty full for a Tuesday night."

Rock shrimp, edamame dumplings, and general tso dumplings were perfection. Filet came out perfectly prepared with a sauce that was impeccable. We got Peking duck rice and it also did not disappoint! Loud music, good with friends or a hot date night!!"
Roz S.,/user_details?userid=455VgOW32Op2r3LHQvbCIQ,"Los Angeles, CA",5/11/2016,5,Had an amazing dinner here a month ago! Love love love the decor of the Resturant. The waiter was really nice and the food was super tasty! We had to wait and extra 15min for our table to be ready so they brought over some complementary appetizers without us even saying anything! This is a great place to do a birthday dinner or a girls night out because the Resturant is super large and can accommodate big parties!

They were breathing down our neck, eager to remove any dishes that were not finished, drinks not drunken. She even stood by as I was writing down her tip, which was very awkward. They also took a picture of us which came out completely blurry. They just left us felt judged and uncomfortable the whole night."
Shauntrice W.,/user_details?userid=yVNjNIILrpJ3FPMemzdeJw,"Upper Marlboro, MD",7/21/2018,1,"I'd read that this place was to die for. We were about 30 minutes late for our reservation but the hostesses were very accommodating and sat us within 10 minutes. Buddakan gave me night club vibes. It was dark and packed from wall to wall, this was a good sign on Friday night. The server was inviting and explained some of the menu items to us. You guys know how we began the dinner, with COCKTAILS of course!! I honestly can't remember the name of the drink I ordered and the website isn't functioning properly, but it was potent. I do know it was served in a flute and included champagne. We wanted to try multiple things on the menu so we ordered the Jade Shrimp Dumplings, the Cantonese Spring Rolls, the Mongolian Lamb Chops, the Sweet & Crispy Jumbo Shrimp, the Glazed Alaskan Black Cod, and the Lobster Fried Rice. First, you have to order everything at once. Drinks, appetizers, and entrée's all have to be ordered at once, but the food arrives at different times. The pictures did not come out as great as I would like them to be because it is very dark in the restaurant. The cardinal rule when taking food pictures is, they should not be enhanced. The food will speak for itself, so no flash should be used. This proved difficult because of the darkness. The first thing to arrive to the table was the Jade Shrimp Dumplings. We were all looking forward to these dumplings, after all, this is a top-rated NYC restaurant right? These dumplings were deplorable. They were steamed and included shrimp, pea shoots, and water chestnuts. I am not a huge fan of water chest nuts but still chose to give the dumplings a try. They were so overpowering and we all spat them out simultaneously. The server saw us and rushed over to rectify the situation. He was very attentive, offered something in replacement of the dumplings, which we declined, and removed them from the bill and the table. Next to arrive were the Cantonese Spring Rolls. They are served 3 to an order and are accompanied with a mustard like sauce.  I always break my spring rolls open because I had a very bad experience at another establishment. This was no different, I broke the spring roll open and had to use the flash from my phone to see what was inside. Yuck mushrooms. I kind of picked through the spring rolls. The roll was fried a perfect golden brown but, I couldn't enjoy it thoroughly because there was so many mushrooms. Next, the Sweet and Crispy Shrimp arrived. There was nothing crispy about these shrimp. I think they were sautéed and drowned in some sort of creamy sauce. They weren't what we expected at all. They weren't crispy nor were they spicy. Next, the lamb chops arrived, let's just say The Mercer Kitchen won the award for Lamb Chops that day. Next, the Alaskan Black Cod arrived. If you've ever eaten at Nobu, their black cod BLOWS Buddakan's out of the water. The Buddakan Cod was under seasoned and under glazed. Finally, the lobster fried rice arrived. It was good but needed some soy sauce. We asked the server for soy sauce and said they had a ""soy vinegar sauce"" instead. I opted no for the sauce and asked that the remaining food be boxed. The server then surprised me with some caramel ice cream that sat on a bed of caramel crunch cookie crumbles. The ice cream was probably the best thing I ate all night. This was a bad experience and I will never dine here again. The service was great but the food was horrible. Sorry Buddakan but it's a big fat no for me."
Michole E.,/user_details?userid=Z70objW6lMxS3TnuK7Lk5w,"New York, NY",1/29/2015,4,Loved this Resturant! The staff was absolutely amazing. We made reservations and was seated right away.

Yuliya R.,/user_details?userid=NPBe6LbHCojkcBKbvisoPA,"Staten Island, NY",1/27/2018,5,"Really enjoyed Buddakan's food. It's a busy place, but service is great, waiter was very accommodating and knowledgeable about menu. Menu a little different from Atlantic City, i liked drinks selection better there. Food was amazing- oxtail dumpling and tuna tar tar spring rolls were good choices for appetizers. Beef fillet was out of this world, white mustard purée was so delicious!!! Short rib was a big portion and full of flavor! Desert- donuts were ok, but chocolate crying was perfect- lava cake but crunchy outside plus coffee ice cream - couldn't be paired better... definitely will come back again, a little pricey for everyday but so worth it for a special occasion..."

Ivy H.,/user_details?userid=NRMoQvdASqHCtjBuz_qUlA,"Flushing, NY",12/3/2016,5,"I came with quite a large party for my friend's 21st birthday. What was interesting to observe was that it just felt as if hands mysteriously appeared from time to time to serve the food. All appetizers were brought out at once, then all the entrees, then all the desserts + cake. There was no personal waiter interaction, but this was good. Water would be refilled when you needed it, without having to say anything to a waiter. Food came out in a timely manner so no complaints there either. Everyone at our table was too engrossed in our own conversations that other customers blended out, that it didn't feel as if the waiters were present, but food just kept coming and only their hands were present. Pretty unreal."
Harrison C.,/user_details?userid=EzSF_ZvIfbVVw8TRuJMdgQ,"Manhattan, NY",8/27/2019,5,"Didn't come here for a while because I thought it would be too ""sceney"". Was a HUGE mistake on my end. Was pleasantly surprised at how great the food was, plus the service and atmosphere were top notch. Ordered the edamame dumplings, cauliflower lollipops, rock shrimp, pork buns, short rib, broken chicken and lo mein and would happily reorder each dish. One person in our party had an allergy and server went above and beyond to accommodate us as well. Easy 5 stars!"

Samuel W.,/user_details?userid=z_f_DQp3LsgHGeCVuq2BZw,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",1/15/2018,3,"First off, the decor and overall look of this place is amazing. Definitely a cool spot to hang out. We had reservations for 6pm  and when we got there they took us to the bar area and we waited maybe 15 minutes we were seated which was cool. My only issue is that I feel, for all of the hype the food is a bit overpriced and slightly underwhelming. It was good, don't get me wrong but I have tasted better for cheaper and got more for my money but on the flip side I think I wouldn't mind going back, I'd just save lots of $$"
Monica D.,/user_details?userid=kWdETl78xlmQM9VaY2tEfA,"Manhattan, NY",1/15/2016,3,"The food has drastically improved over the years but the Philadelphia spot is still number one. All the dishes incorporated interesting flavors and the dumplings were awesome. The drinks were pricey at $17. The only caution I have is that they play club music very loud. For such a beautiful dining room and pricey menu, maybe they should take it down a notch so you're not screaming at dinner."
Tana J.,/user_details?userid=OLzY8keesufOtVk-OYdE0Q,"Brooklyn, NY",5/1/2017,1,"Last night was horrible. We made a  birthday reservation few weeks ahead and when we got there we had to wait one hour. After asking couple of times the hostesses that don't even look up to be seated, we finally were seated.  While we were waiting in the lobby we ordered drinks, once the lady took us to our dinner table we were told that our drinks would be brought to us by the annoyed waiter, but they never made the table. The table where we were seated was so tiny and for sure it wasn't meant to be for 5. It was very unorganized and not pleasant.  The food was ok but our night was ruined. UHHHHH"

Tuna spring rolls were the highlight but after that everything was bland. Edamame dumplings were Luke warm, pork lo mein was a bowl of noodles without much flavor (or pork for that matter). Chili crab also Luke warm and slightly bitter. Black pepper beef had zero flavor. All in all it felt like the kitchen was mailing it in since they normally aren't open for lunch. Definitely won't be back. Tao is similar (modern Asian fusion) but way better."

We didn't know if we were walking into the right building. There isn't much of a store front that indicates what is going on behind the doors. We curiously walked in and entered what seemed to be an odd check in station. It was more hotel like than restaurant. We walked to the bar and met a great bartender. He made us two very creative cocktails. We were soon seated for dinner. We requested the library and were lucky to get in. The waitress was happy and professional. She suggested that if we were hungry, which we were, to order two starters, two mains, and one side. This is exactly what we did. We ordered the oxtail dumplings, tuna tartare spring rolls for apps. They were perfectly prepared. For our mains we ordered the Singapore Chili King Crab and the Lemon Lobster. Amazing! We love seafood and are so tired of the standard steam, butter, squeeze of lemon offerings. These were creative and the culinary skill was clear. If you love seafood I suggest you try these two. For a side we ordered the wok tossed noodles with prawns. Perfect! Finally for desert we shared the chocolate pistachio cremoso and the Spiced Carrot Cake. Both were decedent with a perfect presentation. I never rate a place 5 stars. I only have a few. Buddakan is 5 stars. We will certainly be back again."

Myrna H.,/user_details?userid=aw2LqmcuQ2FW9DZn-T5PBw,"Seattle, WA",8/5/2015,2,"Not sure what the hype is with this place. Well this is a great place with great ambience for drink. But we made a reservation at 9 and we only got our table at 950pm on a Wed nite. Ok not a great first impression. Our server definitely suggested to order way more food that what we think we need. And then she did not come back and ask how the food was or anything. And we sudd just got another server altogether. Seriously...... we ordered fried rice - way too dry, the wok noodle - way too soft. The saving grace is the black alaskan cod. That's it! Sorry Buddakan but I won2be going back. Spice Market across the street is so much better."
Deniece Q.,/user_details?userid=kCzAQGWNtLpJBB7_PPRJEw,"Queens, Queens, NY",10/9/2017,3,Went here for my friend's birthday and it was about 6 of us. The atmosphere is great and it's enjoyable especially if you're a sex and the city fan. I ordered their duck salad with string beans on the side. The salad was really good especially the dressing. My friends got fried rice orders and a chicken dish. It's a nice place to go for a girls night.

The Dan Dan noodles were very spicy. The fried rice was my favorite dish of the night. The signature edamame dumplings were okay. The server seemed knowledgable about the wine list on top of being friendly. When pouring one of our wines, most of it ended up on the table opposed to in the glass. The manager showed up a few minutes later and offered a complimentary dessert for the mishap. Great service, awesome decor, better than average food. Solid 4."

Though the lounge area was crowded, a hostess took our name and was able to seat us in the lounge in 10 minutes without a reservation! Service was immaculate in both the lounge and dining area and the food was pretty good! My only complaint is I only liked 1 out 4 drinks from their cocktail menu."

Forget about that old, in-updated, worse-service-ever, TAO. As a vegetarian I found plenty of dishes to my liking especially this 'dream-in a dim-sum' first course of the ademame dumplings. Can't wait to go again. For the desert lovers- I'm not a big fan of the sweets but the green tea doughnut is one of the best sweet dishes, most interesting things I've ever tried. The cocktails are super, too. Enjoy it:) a must if you are in NYC"

I would highly recommend the spicy tofu and the edamame dumplings. We will definitely be back to eat dinner, but this is definitely a trendy restaurant. By the time we left (around 7:30pm), we felt very under dressed."
A. B.,/user_details?userid=aSI4hZV6b4Q-8dQ8gkQ6bg,"Washington, DC",12/8/2018,3,"I can easily describe this restaurant in three terms to give you the perfect idea of what you are in for.  It's a ménage à trois of P.F. Chang's, dim sum, and ""A Night at the Roxbury"".  I dare you to go here and call me a liar.  Anyway, the food is good but not quite good enough for the prices.  The service was very good and the restaurant is clean and well kept.  It's decorated just like a P.F. Chang's would be if they had a restaurant as large as this one is.  The thing that brought it from 4 stars to 3 for me was the dance club music with the same continuos beat all throughout the meal. You know the kind:  the never-ending ""donsh, donsh, donsh, donsh"", to the point that it's almost comical.  It doesn't matter what the ""song"" is, it's the same beat...  dim sum after dim sum... all meal long...  How about some culturally appropiate music for a better ambience?  Anyway, it would be an okay place for a couple of young DINKs just branching out and spreading their culinary wings, I guess.  It just wasn't for me."

Had the Chile chicken, general tsaos dumplings and $16 for pineapple fried rice. Nothing special about any of it. Service was also average. The Ambiance was very nice until it started getting busy and they cranked up the music and we could barely hear each other at the table. $260 for 3 people - we felt ripped off and still a bit hungry."

Jim H.,/user_details?userid=Cove3Ct9ngz5sn9048uPFQ,"New York, NY",4/9/2017,5,"I almost gave Buddakan 4 stars. But, I've eaten here so many times and it has always been a perfect experience! So, I went ahead and gave it 5 stars, knowing that there must be some room for improvement... I just can't find out where though! I appreciate the way this restaurant is very discreetly placed inside an unassuming building. I think that where this restaurant is located used to be a cookie factory -and I don't think they've changed the façade at all. Most people passing by, would never know that behind this simple brick building, houses one of Manhattan's most palatial and famous restaurants. Immediately as you walk inside is the reception area for your check in. The lounge is just a little past here, for you to enjoy a beverage, as you wait for your table. I've never had to wait long for my reservation. Now, to get into the dining rooms one must descend an impressive staircase that looks down onto Buddakan's sumptuous main dining room -designed by Christian Liaigre. The ceiling in this opulent dining room seems as high as Mount Everest's summit -with gargantuan chandeliers that are suspended over a long banquet table in the center of this swanky room . And even though I've exaggerated a bit on the height of the ceiling, nonetheless, it's quite an impressive, high ceilinged, lavish dining room. Buddakan has other dining rooms that are beautifully decorated with hanging tapestries. These dining rooms have private tables available -unlike the banquet table, which is a shared table. The food is always so delicious and the pacing of the meal is perfect. The waitstaff here is very professional and they are superb in their line of work. I especially enjoy dim sum and Buddakan is well known for their delicate edamame dumplings. This dumpling's wrapping is so refined, that you can actually see through it -to the edamame filling inside. The shallot-watercress broth is a perfect complement to this dish. The carrot dumplings are also delicious. I like the chili rock shrimp, the tuna tartare spring rolls, the crispy cauliflower lollipops are fun and yummy, the oxtail dumplings are incredibly flavorful, as are the jade shrimp dumplings, the king crab and lobster shu, General Tso's dumplings are good for a chicken appetizer. Also, I really enjoy the pork buns or it's also called pork belly bao. Even though I can easily be satisfied on the appetizers here -because it's like a tasting menu, for a main course I like the filet if beef with crispy wontons and a mustard sauce. For dessert the crying chocolate is another famous item on Buddakan's menu. People like to dress with a flair, when they dine here. This adds to the beauty of the restaurant. Enjoy!"

The ambiance is incredible and I would call it a hidden treasure being that all you see upon entrance is a dark door. While waiting for our table I was directed to the restroom when I viewed some meals along the way, and their short rib dinner caught my eye. I decided to select that meal as my entree which was definitely a fulfilling and tasty meal. The meal included noodles and mushroom in a light sauce. Two people can share that entree with other sides as options. I did have left overs. I also ordered the shrimp toast as an appetizer and a side of veggie fried rice which had a citrus type of sauce on the side that was light and fluffy. They serve everything as they are prepared, so we did receive appetizers, entrees, and sides at all different times. They also have a menu in which everyone can pay a flat rate and share the food. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area and or to celebrate any special occasion."

Make reservation, always busy and crowded. Hoisin glazed pork belly is amazing, charred filet of beef melts in your mouth, and got to have the Peking duck.  The place is load, but fun. The staff are very helpful and professional. Your in the Meatpacking district, so go and have fun. The main dining room is great, but be careful walking down the stairs, very steep. But, nice view of the dining room from the stairs."

This is a very trendy restaurant so make sure you put on something fancy. This place is always busy and rightfully so the food is great and the drinks are very good.  I would recommend the ox tail dumplings, pork buns and I enjoyed the fried rice. I have the crab fried rice and it was good but I would've liked more crab. Either way come with a group of friends to be fancy and this place is so much fun. Each place that you sit in that location has a totally different feel which I love. The only way I could describe this place is sexy. I will say that this is Chinese fusion food. People looking for authentic Chinese cuisine are going to be disappointed coming here. This is an Asian fusion restaurant that serves a very good dishes and very pretty dishes. I don't know if I say this place is expensive I'd say that I liked a lot of things on the menu so I ordered a lot which made it expensive. I think that if you came here with a few friends had one appetizer and each had an entrée then it's more than fair price. The service was OK but I think it was due to a busy night so I will give them a pass this time."

Everything was spot on and beautifually presented.. For entrees, we chose black pepper beef, filet of beef,charred filet of beef, glazed alaskan black cod, peking duck, and broken chili chicken.. as the sides we got dungeness crab sticky rice, minced pork lo mein, and cauliflower stir fry.. you could've cut the filet of beef with a spoon, it was so tender.. we chose almond bread pudding and crying chocolate.. its been 4 months and people still rave to us about the food.. i could not have asked for anything better"

I knew seeing her that this was a good place. It's expensive but it's really enormous and has beutiful architecture. We were seated right away without a wait. We had a table for a party of 7, and the table was pretty big for us. I ordered the monkfish and was really glad I did. It melted in my mouth. I know I'm definitely going back there again."

However the ""hostesses"" and the people managing reservations are sent from hell. The system that is set is truly awful. We got there 7 minutes early and she told us ""well you're early go have a drink at the bar."" So we did and and after about 30 minutes I went back and asked if our table was ready and she said ""yeah one of the hostess has your table."" So I was sent on this sort of scavenger hunt from one rude hostess to the other asking if that specific hostess had my table. Whats even worse is that when you did track down a hostess (they're wearing tight black dresses so they look like any other patron) they don't even bother to help you find the right person. The other patrons were annoyed as well. So for this start to a great meal Buddakan gets two stars and in the future I'll spend my money elsewhere."

Food is just OKAY, it's a little bit better than Chinese take out food, but way worse than some of the authentic Chinese food I have ever had, and it's overpriced. For decent Chinese food and a reasonable price, go to Chinatown. I will not go back to this place, and not recommending it to my friends."

Becky K.,/user_details?userid=Hb2RzG3b9YEBlrwBWzGtCA,"Henderson, NV",5/24/2014,5,I reserved a table for 6 about a month in advance. We had to add a few to our party once we arrived but we were seated within 30 minutes. The restaurant is beautiful but dark in some of the rooms. For an appetizer we had the lobster eggrolls and the dumplings. Both were delicious. For our meal we had the lobster fried rice and the crispy jumbo shrimp. The shrimp were absolutely amazing. For dessert we had the carrot cake which was almost too pretty to eat but it was superb. The price for two of us was about $130 with cocktails.
Thomas T.,/user_details?userid=fyzb32RNjXXFvi1dkuFWig,"Secaucus, NJ",3/6/2017,5,Absolutely amazing time gorgeous place food was to die for. Recommend the short ribs. Waiter was top notch not once did mine or my dates glass of wine go empty.

There was an option to do a family style or individual plates; we chose the family style. The portions were a little small, but enough to just satisfy. The staff were incredibly nice and helpful. Overall I am happy with my experience."

All the dishes honestly tasted the same as those from my neighborhood Szechuan and/or Thai place but were about double the price. I guess people go here for the environment. It is very beautiful inside. The service was good overall. So yea... go there for the ""ambiance"" but not the food."

I do feel that the waitress was misleading saying the portions were small but they weren't that small. Atmosphere is nice. Maybe would go back. But I do think it's over priced for the quality .

Kristina S.,/user_details?userid=FUiwP_epMtI8C2GRMVkN2g,"New York, NY",4/10/2017,5,This is by far our favorite restaurant to go to. You must make reservations early enough in the week to get a good time they fill up quickly. The lobster fried rice is our favorite thing to order on the menu. They always do something special if you let them know in advance if it's a bday or anniversary. The wait staff is adorable and so attentive and the management comes up to every table. One of the best places in NYC!

The waitstaff was super patient when part of our party was running late. I expected the bill to be much higher than it was based on the quality. Yes it's pricey, but so worth it. I would have gladly paid more. My only gripe is that our server dropped a drink and it spilled on the table. I think the restaurant should have offered us something as a courtesy. However, this is still one of my favorite dining experiences, ever. Definitely a step above Tao...with one exception, the Lychee Martini at Tao is still the best I've had."

Baby G.,/user_details?userid=SkX3Xp5QrE3Y9uItp3Wk6g,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/3/2019,1,I wish I could give this restaurant no stars but I'll give them 1 star for the ambience. First let me start by saying that I made a reservation at 5pm for 8:30pm reservation FOR MY BIRTHDAY. I arrived with my boyfriend at 8:20 as we arrived one of the assistant managers Nada told me that they were still seating the 8 o'clock reservations and that she knew it was my birthday celebration and then asked if it's ok to wait by the bar area where everyone normally waits to get seated at their tables. We ordered two glasses of wine and started making conversation with my boyfriend. At 9pm I went back to Nada and she gave me another excuse line with OH WE ARE SORRY BUT WE ARE NOW ON OUR 8:15pm RESERVATIONS AND YOU HAVE 4 COUPLES AHEAD OF YOU. I went back to my boyfriend to deliver the message but starting to get annoyed. Then returning back to the bar the guy who was serving me was Mexican so he said but the Asian guy was making jokes about me elbowing the bartender serving me and telling him jokes in his ear about me and telling him BRO YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS BACK!! HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT MY BOYFRIEND TO HIS FACE and make me feel like I was less than you because of me being a TRANS girl. THE NERVE OF THIS ASIAN BARTENDER. I myself would've done something beyond disrespectful and throw him my drink but I asked to speak with the manager. They brought me NADA but she was already annoying me with the excuses so I requested another manager and that's when Martin arrived. I explained to him the situation and he did NOT care about it AT ALL. He just gave me a BS excuse and walked away. Situations like this SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT ASIAN BARTENDER SHOULDN'T WORK IN RESTAURANTS IN NYC KNOWING LGBT IS VERY POPULAR HERE. I carry myself very conservative and well mannered. I WONT EVER BE GOING TO THIS PLACE. So Mark then came to me and said my table was ready at 10:15pm I am one to not like eating after 9pm because of my gastro reflect issues with my stomach. This was seriously so unprofessional and disgusting and disrespectful for me to be treated this way. I almost started crying but didn't want my boyfriend to know why I was sad and upset. I will NEVER return to this place ever again by the way the food was not worth the money. I ordered the lobster and shrimp noodles it wasn't all that it looked like a plate worth 15.00 from your corner Chinese restaurant. The wine was good and the tuna rolls were good as well. My boyfriend then told the waitress it was my birthday and she brought out a little treat which I wasn't in the mood because of the way they treated me. Two hours passed and I was the bathroom with stomach pain and nausea due to my gastro reflect issues all because of their dishonesty and preferences. Sadly I liked this place so much BUT I WONT EVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.

We had the oxtail dumplings that were perfect in texture and full of tasty oxtail! The short rib scallion pancakes were also delicious and the green apple on top provided a fresh crunch. My husband had the broken chicken, it was simple, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It came with a tasty sauce. I had the Singapore crab, it came with several pieces of meaty crab legs, pre cut so you don't get messy, in a thick chili sauce. I squeezed lime juice on them making it perfect. Very filling, because you get quite a few legs. We also ordered the cauliflower and pork dish which was also tasty. We finished with a light dessert, the rice sorbet and pineapple. The waitress was so nice and personalized the desert when we told her we were celebrating our engagement anniversary. Great way to end a great meal!"

I've been here before and always had a good experience but the service today was incredibly bad until I have to write this ONE STAR REVIEW. The waitress made many derogatory and condescending comments, treating us like we were of lower class than her?!! She lied about the portion and keep pushing us to order so much food, and didnt welcome us. For example, we ordered 8 items and she replied 'Oh, that's it?' (In a very mean and rude way). Then we said we wanted tap water, and she replied 'Oh, New York finest' (very rude, is like as if there is something wrong with ordering tap water and we should not be dining here). Are you kidding me?? Then we couldn't take it anymore and talked to the manager about this waitress situation. He apologized and switched the waitress to another one and it was good afterwards. I gave ONE STAR because I wish they do something more to compensate us for ruining our mood.  I was so surprised that a place like this would hire that kind of RUDE WAITRESS ( she has short hair and not Asian ). I wish someone from the management read this and take disciplinary action to teach her a lesson. Anyway, if you dine here, make sure to switch the waitress if you are unlucky like us and get this bitchy rude short hair skinny waitress."

The food is inventive, delicious, and in my opinion, reasonably priced--the prices are comparable to other upscale Asian restaurants in New York, maybe a little less, but the portions are much more generous. The service is impeccable, and what I most recently discovered: the delivery! I can't believe they deliver on seamless, and they are the best seamless experience I've ever had! I can't believe how quickly they get here with the hot, fresh, beautifully packaged food! There is nothing this place can't do"
Erica M.,/user_details?userid=CldwTERJS6UP6ouHor-XWA,"Milpitas, CA",11/18/2014,5,Best service!  Dim lighting and lots of chatter when you first walk in.  Coat check at front bar up the stairs.  Waiter accommodated every guests need including asking chef to make some items gluten free.  Chili chicken was delicious! Vegetable rice with coconut curry super good!  Not to mention the other million items we ordered!  Almond bread pudding for dessert is a must also had the crying chocolate.  I loved the bread pudding best!

Now the wait is minimal for your food so it definitely is not prepared fresh, but I would have given 5 Stars if food was hot. If you dont mind food not being very hot, this is an awesome place. Its my 3rd visit, and I would go back again, just request my food to be HOT."

We enjoyed the music of a brilliant female DJ with half a tattoo sleeve who kept the main bar lively. We were then escorted to our table and service was warm and attentive. Manager Anthony touched our table and made sure we were enjoying everything to our liking. We were bid farewell by manager Kermit and all support staff on the floor. Buddakan hit a home run with their hospitality.

Roh E.,/user_details?userid=I_4s-HaYJ5YIVMOisFTEbA,"New York, NY",9/27/2016,4,"Came here the other night with family who were visiting from London. The menu is tapa style or a tasting menu if you're a party of 6 or more. Half of the party I was with did the tasting menu. They were very accommodating when some of the people at the table asked about about making a few changes because of allergies or religious food exceptions they were very kind and helpful. I would recommend reservations especially on weekend if you're coming with a group. It's pricey but the quality of the food is amazing. Lovely crowd, food and restaurant."

Emily S.,/user_details?userid=M9unp4x-5NTDpzZlhqaXHw,"Edison, NJ",8/20/2016,3,Great date night spot or place to grab small plates and drinks. A bit over priced. Did not enjoy the quality of food for the price I was paying. I ordered their bads dish and it was extremely salty and the skin/ scales were fried with the fish which made it chewy. The fish also came w the entire body incl. head fried as decoration. Kind of made me loose my appetite. The pepper beef was good but an extremely small portion for a 30-40$ dish. The cauliflower lollipops were the best.
M L.,/user_details?userid=ifPlmqE-u7rr9FugHEenEg,"London, United Kingdom",7/19/2015,5,"What an awesome place. We had Sesame shrimp, Chilli rock shrimp, Salt & pepper black bass and a ton of other dishes ... All just delicious!! Oh and don't forget to try the Crying chocolate dessert"

It is pricey but I think the nice atmosphere, beautiful restaurant, and great service plus good food make it all worth it. Great for a date and for groups!"

It's absolutely one of my favorite spots in NYC. I've been coming here for years and the food is consistently delicious and on point. Great for dates. Very sexy spot with a great bar and cocktails. The staff is professional, efficient and  friendly. I can honestly say I've never had a crap time here. It's not cheap though- but that's fine because the menu is mostly shared dishes, so you can mix and match. They also have a prix fixe menu which I've tried the last time I was there with a large party of 6. It worked out great. I got to sample loads of dishes I'd not had before. The desserts are decadent and not to be gross but the toilets are nice too. They have an upstairs and a downstairs. Downstairs has more lighting and is not as sexy as the upstairs but a more antique chic vibe. Upstairs is dimly lit and modern. Music fills the place and it's swanky and upbeat. My favorite dish is the crab rice. All this to say- ""check this place it out!"""

But if you don't mind spending a certain amount of money then this might be a perfect place for you. I had the sticky crab rice, which was good but a little dry. I didn't enjoy the service only because when they bought out the food, they just put all of our orders in the middle of the table. So it was a guessing game on who had which food.  I would return to the restaurant but on a date because it was hard to speak with everyone at the table because the place was loud."

Our server was extraordinary and helped coordinate with the kitchen to make sure I didn't miss out on the experience or seem like an inconvenience.  I just rolled with what he brought out and ALL of it was just so good.

The first look is pretty great - dark and elegant. We had high hopes for the food and especially looking at the prices I thought it would be special. Cocktail was extremely watered down, had to sent it back. Ordered lobster roll as an appetizer just for me nothing great and too big of a portion so had to pack half of it. Ordered the king crab main - it was ok 3.5/5. Wife being a vegetarian ordered some tofu main - tasteless and couldn't finish it and didn't want to pack it as well. Don't think we'll be going there again."

The hosts(all six of them) greeted me and my guests and escorted us to the lounge which is the first room of the restaurant. As you wait to be escorted to your table. The lounge was grand and beautiful. Within minutes we were escorted to the grand dining room which was a lower level area with 50' ceilings I believe. Gorgeous chandeliers and paneling on the walls. The food was perfect. We ordered the crab and lobster siu mei, Mongolian lamb chops, broken chili chicken, hk shrimp and scallops, wok noodles with prawns, chilled udon, chicken fried rice, chocolate malted tart, chocolate cremoso and a bottle of Veuve Cliquot. Food was absolutely delicious in every way. Presentation was everything you expected of fine dining, nothing short of Michelin status. Our Server Daniel was excellent and very attentive every step of the way. Never needed to search for him, always there pouring our champagne and refilling water and making sure everything was perfect. Will be back soon."

This is more of new and creative Chinese fusion. Reminds me of Hakassan Group.  The dinning doesn't look like the round table Chinese dining rather it looks like hogwartz or phantom of the opera themed. Have their unique cocktail (oolong tea with vodka, what?) definitely fits the trend of Chelsea district.  Worth experience it if you got the financial mean to!"
Erin F.,/user_details?userid=rbBGMAlVidOnOznGeEeaYw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/2/2019,5,This was one of the most wonderful dining experiences I've had. The wait staff are so kind and helpful as well as knowledgeable. The menu does not have much allergy information written in it but if you ask the staff they can make suggestions and tell exactly what you can eat as well as make wonderful suggestions. They were happy to provide information and accommodations for a gluten allergy. We almost got a different dessert until the waiter suggested the Mochi donuts. We switched our order and could not have been happier. Mochi donuts are completely gluten free and have the same texture to a normal donut rather than the more cake like consistency of most gluten free donuts. A rare and well appreciated gem in the gluten free world.

Very crowded and definitely a hot spot. The bar is not set up well! Literally a solid block of metal so you have no place for your legs...so don't eat at the bar! The bartender, forgot her name, was excellent! Friendly and helpful with drink and food suggestions and even with the crowd she took great care to help us. We started with edamame dumplings... They were delicious! Unfortunately there were only five of them and it's $15 for that dish... Can't say it was really worth it but they were still very good. For dinner we had the lo mein with prawns and the spicy monkfish on her suggestion. The lo mein with prawns was very good. The monk fish I didn't realize was fried, which I didn't want but oh well. I found the sauce on the monk fish was way to cloying and not very spicy at all. Wouldn't recommend that dish! Drinks were fine, place is a little pricey! I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could."

I'm no stranger to fine dining but I was not impressed by the service. It took 1 hour for us to be seated, with no concessions being made or even offered. The prices are not justified by the portion size or the quality. Came here for Valentine's Day dinner and I've never been so angry. I can Understand that a place is busy and the staff may be overwhelmed- but in all high quality establishments, the trouble the consumer felt is acknowledged and sometimes remedied. I am positive that in the long run this place will go under with this type of service. Stay away if you'd like quality. Dare to make a reservation if you want to try somewhere considered chic regardless of quality of service/food."

The host sat us in the hall with all the chandeliers and the atmosphere was so grand and romantic. I made reservations through open table and requested if they would write ""Happy 10th year anniversary"" on our dessert plate and they happily came through! The food was a little pricy but it was worth it for an important celebration."

Went once for a bachelorette party and did the tasting menu, so much food and soooo yummy. The other time went for my husbands birthday and it was also delicious but I recommend going with a bigger group if you're into trying a lot of new foods. Edamame dumplings, Peking duck salad, crab sticky rice,  and the filet with soy butter sauce are just some of the must try's !! Drinks are NYC prices, to be expected, but the specialty drinks were very tasty"

Tiera B.,/user_details?userid=WtmrOAKzrql1oAhrvoWMjg,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",2/7/2019,4,"The restaurant is easy to miss when your walking down the street. We actually passed it at first and had to be directed. You're met with a large black door when you find the restaurant. Once you enter you're in a dimly lit room with modern music blasting. There's a bar tucked to the side that has  wine and unique cocktail drinks. The real reason to come here is for the main room downstairs. When you decent down the long staircase you enter a room straight out of the Victorian era. With its high ceilings, elegant Turkish sofas, renaissance art and long banquet table that can fit about 80 people or even more! It made me think about the last supper. The restaurant is stunning. The rap music selection is such a juxtaposition with the appearance of the dining hall. Which made it all the more fun. Who doesn't like good music? It's an Asian infusion restaurant so they have dumplings, sushi, fish and lobster fried rice, which was what I settled on getting. I think the 1 thing that could have been better at this restaurant ironically enough, was the food. The lobster fried rice was dry, a little cold and could do with more seasoning. Maybe it was just my dish. Because the dumplings were good and one of my cousin's dish,which was sea bass, was very good! There were only 4 dumplings in total however. So my recommendation would be go for the experience, because it is a beautiful restaurant and maybe skip the lobster fried rice."
Megan Z.,/user_details?userid=7w9lZodE8TrWYzT-k4MJ0Q,"Manhattan, NY",2/3/2016,5,"Love. Have been here many times. Very consistent service and food. Some of my favorites are (in no particular order!): edamame dumplings, General Tso's dumplings, scallion short rib pancakes, charred filet of beef, and the cauliflower stir fry. Sitting in the bar area is always entertaining and the service is just as good as being seated. The restaurant is huge so can get a little loud on busy nights."

Demonstratively strong dumplings, pork belly buns and moo shu duck."

But thought we'd give this place a shot since I'd heard about it before. Upon arriving- this place is trendy. It's dark, it's loud, it's lively. Ok, so, this place is all about atmosphere and drinks. A very cool space. But, let's be real. I'm here for the food. It's...well, white people Chinese food. Small portions, heavy on the soy, and just mediocre. We got the wild mushroom chow fun and it was good. A little salty, but at least good chew to the noodles. We also got the broccoli, which was good and cooked well. And the Hong Kong style shrimp and scallops. Hard pass. It came out on a large plate with a small dip in the middle to hold the inside of a pot pie looking dish. Wasn't that flavourful and the seafood was cut up so it looked like there was more of it than there was. Perhaps, we ordered the wrong things? Glad I got to try it, but doesn't warrant a return."

The ambiance of the main room was very warm, due to the huge ceilings and great lighting. To much chagrin, we were seated in a different room. Our server was a very nice woman but just lacked intelligence. For example, I ordered a drink and she never brought it out. Also, she spilled water on my girlfriends leg and never even acknowledged that it occurred. Food wise, the rock shrimp was the best part of the meal. Also, I recommend the Shanghai king krab legs. The sauce was great. In general, the food was great. It's a shame that bad service ruined my meal."

It was easy to set up a reservation through Opentable. We were running a few minutes behind due to traffic but they hold your reservation for 15 minutes so luckily we got there just in time. Everything about this place says trendy NY. Nice ambiance, and it was pretty packed on a Wednesday night. The food and service were good, but nothing was an absolute wow for me (which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars). I enjoyed my dinner and would probably recommend it, but would I go back again? Probably not."

Even if the restaurant is entirely open (eg 5:30pm) and you have a reservation, the staff will outright lie that ""your table isn't ready and you'll have to sit in the lounge"". It's incredibly frustrating if you just want to be seated, especially when the lie is so transparent."

We did the tasting menu as we were told it would feed 7 people easily. The waiter also let us know if we needed them to make any accomodations for allergies, vegetarians, etc. -  a rarity in places like this. There was more than enough food to go around - the edamame dumplings are not to be missed. I don't even eat fish, and the sea bass was so good - my clients told me it was the most amazing fish they had ever had. Our Paris client was so impressed - ""best dinner I've had in New York thus far"". And if you doubt that review - trust me - these people are well-traveled, people!"

Kristin S.,/user_details?userid=43jNy2LV8spJI_d5Zl2q3w,"Deerfield Beach, FL",12/28/2017,1,"Update....I hastily wrote a scathing review that I would like to revise. I wrote it while I was angry and frustrated from the lack of service, and what seem to be complete obliviousness of the staff. Here's what happened. We had a reservation for dinner on my birthday on December 19. We arrived 20 minutes prior to our reservation time of 8:45. We happily sat in the bar to have a cocktail while waiting for a table. It was a fairly busy Tue night. We finished our cocktails in about 20 minutes or so and sat there with empty glasses for about another 10 minutes or so. The cocktail waitress never came back to check on us. We decided to check on our table as it was well after our res time. My boyfriend was told that they were clearing some tables and we would be seated shortly. We decided to order some wine while we waited for our table. It took us a while to flag down the inattentive cocktail waitress and when we did she told us the bartender was not making any cocktails because there was a special guest in the house. I told her that sounded absurd and could he possibly pour us a glass of wine, and she said ""yes I think he can do that"". I thought this was a very offensive comment to tell another guest in the restaurant. It took a while to get our glass of wine. We finished our wine, and all in we had been waiting well over an hour. My boyfriend went to check on the table again and he was told by the unfriendly hostess that our table wasn't ready and she could not tell him when it would be ready. He said we had been waiting a long time and the hostess told him ""do you see how busy the bar is? everyone in there is waiting for a table as well."" With that snarky comment we got fed up, flagged down the cocktail waitress and asked for our check to leave. She asked why we were not waiting for a table and seemed surprised when I told her that we had been waiting too long with very little to zero communication from the staff. She ended up sending the manager over who returned our credit card, apologized and proceeded to explain that the health inspector had come and shut down the restaurant. I'm not sure if this is true or not, as the restaurant was completely packed at this point and people seemed to be eating and getting drinks all around us. The manager was actually very apologetic and offered to make it up to us but at this point we were very hungry, frustrated and offended, and decided to go elsewhere. The lack of communication, the rudeness of some of the staff and the obliviousness of the cocktail waitress was unexceptable and almost ruined my birthday, but we managed to get a quick reservation elsewhere not too far away and had a wonderful meal in a beautiful restaurant with impeccable service and delicious food. I doubt I will go back to Buddakan when there are so many other amazing choices in NY."
Mary Ann B.,/user_details?userid=ELr6gV2fPboznYzz5xh9ug,"Miami, FL",12/22/2017,1,"I made reservations two weeks in advance for a party of three. We arrived to a rather snooty male who asked to see my email confirmation as my name did not appear in their system. (Even though I had booked on Open Table). The restaurant is beautiful. However, the attitude of the employees was terrible... My group and I are well dressed, well heeled professionals who really did not deserve such a snotty attitude from a college student (if that)... I located the confirmation, and we sat and waited in the lounge. We noticed there was zero service in the lounge and guests were actually expected to go to the bar themselves to order drinks. There was no dispersement of drink menus either. Honestly, if you are a higher income professional, do not waste your time or money in this ""want to be"" environment. There are plenty of other high end establishments to enjoy in NYC. I am glad I did not stay to try the cuisine. Dr. B."
Alyssa T.,/user_details?userid=LiA7SwbGMULGr8-5gbKfVQ,"Philadelphia, PA",3/13/2017,4,"I went to Buddakan for my first time this past weekend with a group of 6 other people. I was extremely impressed by the size and decor of the restaurant. We arrived around 6:30 and did not leave till a little after 9 pm. Our server was great, but as we were finishing dinner, the lounge turned over to more of a night club feel. It got really crowded, a DJ started playing and then service got really slow. The food was great! Our group tried a lot of different dishes and everything was plated beautifully and tasted great."
Sandra B.,/user_details?userid=yYzjd1EHTn1Hr85OUdBTDg,"Jersey City, NJ",12/3/2017,4,"Came here on a Saturday night. We made a reservation a couple weeks prior for 6 people, only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. The restaurant is really beautiful, the main dining area down the stairs is gorgeous. The area with the tables on the upper level is kinda dark but still nice. For a group of 6 we were offered the tasting menu but chose not to go with it. The dim sum dumplings are really good. We had the general tso chicken dumpling and loved them. Our friends had the shrimp dumplings and said they were really good. I had the short ribs and loved it, the meat was so tender and the mushroom chow fun is so delicious. The port chow mein is good, although I liked the chow fun noodles more. My friends had the lobster fried rice and Chinese fried rice and really enjoyed it. A friend had the steak and loved his meal. My husband originally ordered the seabass, which comes out as the whole fish, head and bones included. He said it was very fishy and Smokey and hated it. He actually ended it ordering the jumbo shrimp instead, and the waiter kindly took the seabass off the bill. I can honestly say the food here is much better than Tao. Overall, beautiful restaurant with good food."

Alicia S.,/user_details?userid=xx6BoHPnfXfaQ1_Klhiceg,"Manhattan, NY",3/6/2017,4,"Atmosphere was amazing!  We were celebrating a friends birthday which was also like a couples night originally we were placed next to the kitchen so we asked to have different seats and they told us it would be about a 20 minute wait.  While ordering at the bar the wait seemed shorter.  Food was good my husband said it was great, I loved my dessert and our waiter seemed attentive to us she checked in regularly.  The only problem my table seemed to have was everyone said their food was cold *yikes* you cant have cold steak or cold rice.  When it came to my order I guess because they forgot about my order and once they realized it my Codfish came out blazing hot. To me the dessert was the best part."

The staff is always professional. Plenty of wine and good drinks on the menu, but the food is center-stage. Be ready to order a lot, and to share everything. A great selections of vegetarian, seafood, and meats all with an asian-fusion flare. Great for entertaining, business dinners, out-of-towners, and special occasions. This place has everything.

I didn't see a drawbridge, but you go for the show less for comfort, Would say it's part of the trendlet of Tao, Spice Market etc. Think though that Buddakan excels those peers on many fronts. Almost everything I tried was executed well. The menu was pretty comprehensive with some inspired options and surprises. The price point too is very reasonable for the quality of food and portions that you get."

I think we were too busy admiring the place to notice the food (which I didn't think was so spectacular and the portions were kind of small...) the rock chili shrimp was delicious but a little pricey (18$) for the amount. I'd recommend that and the lobster rice. Well that's what you can expect for a beautiful place like this in the city. Our main server was also quite rude, making snide comments after everyone made their order. However, a different server with the bill was a little nicer but sarcastic. We enjoyed the night and were the last guests in the main dining hall so took lots of time taking pictures! I did have their donut dessert which is where my stars go to, that and the place itself!"

I used to come here a lot but hadn't been here in years and had dinner on a whim just over a week ago. Some dishes were a bit salty but overall the food was great. The filet of beef dish was amazing we wished we had gotten two to replace one of the chicken dishes we got which just was not very good. They first thing when I tried that chicken dish was it tasted like a hot dog, not even joking. It's crazy because I love everything normally (and I like hot dogs lol) but something about this was not good to me.  The cocktail we had was great too. Recommended for those in the area who have never tried it and for those who haven't been in a while. You will remember why you used to go all the time!"

From the outside its very dark.  Once I entered, the scenery and atmosphere was amazing. It was a unforgettable fancy dinner at a great price. The staff was very attentive and kind. The food was inexpensive considering we had 8 girls where we ordered tons of drinks, entrees and appetizer's. They also brought out a beautiful small desert lava cake with a message, saying ""congratulations on your engagement with a candle.That gesture was greatly appreciated. Overall, I had a great time and a great experience. I would definitely come back and I would highly recommend Buddkan."

Tried the monk fish this time and it wasn't my favorite but my friends went crazy over it. The cocktails are always good. And the short rib is still phenomenal. Bring anyone new in town to this place just to watch how big their eyes get from the moment they walk in.

When I didn't know which cocktail to order, the waiter had a special one made for me based on my taste/liquor preferences, and when it came out being a little too sweet for my liking, immediately brought it back and made me a new one. In addition, my friend and I wanted to try out the edamame dumplings but ended up not enjoying the texture. The waiter gladly provided us with another type of dumpling for no extra charge. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience here and will definitely be coming back! The food is absolutely delicious. I recommend the sea bass, chicken and ginger dumplings, and the ginger cake for dessert."

I was here in early May with a friend for a girls night out and it was definitely a ""Wow!"" dinner experience!!  Walking down the staircase into the large dining room was breathtaking! Our server was wonderful - she answered all our questions about ingredients and made excellent drink pairing and side dish recommendations. We ordered a bit too much food for two people, but it was fun to try so many different dishes! Definitely order the lobster egg rolls and the pineapple rice. The edamame dumplings were much more decadent and richly textured than I was expecting, but should not be missed. While the Chinese broccoli was perfectly cooked and surprisingly well paired with a sprinkle of nuts, the truffles in the dish did not enhance the flavor profile. The ambiance was spectacular and overall the food delicious!! Go if you can!"
Hayley L.,/user_details?userid=dZsEk2_LL9ZzPm5yDqH96Q,"New York, NY",1/1/2017,5,"Buddakan is one of my go to spots in Manhattan, whether it's for date night or a night out with the girls. From the service to the food to the decor, everything about this restaurant is spectacular. I went last night for New Years with my boyfriend and we had an incredible time. Shout out to our waitress Christina on holding it down on such a crazy night. Make sure to try the carrot dumplings and tuna tartar spring rolls. I will definitely be back again."
K W.,/user_details?userid=Fpa8__ZfvVa8ZOlPh0QeRg,"Houston, TX",8/9/2016,4,"A bit of a wait, longer than what I would expect when having set reservations, so we sat in a ""holding area"" and purchased very expensive drinks while we waited. Food was pretty amazing (steak, braised rib, appetizers, etc) , although my friend was not crazy about her fried rice. The service was just barely ok-- actually pretty bad. We had a couple people talking to us so we were confused and a bunch of food we didn't order got delivered to use but they were nice enough to leave it and remove it off of our bill-- just a busy place I suppose so kind of a mad house. Very nice atmosphere however."

The ambiance here is very beautiful with a bar in the front and lots of dining table space downstairs with a very high ceiling. The wifi was great. And the bathrooms were dimly lit with music. The staff here was also very friendly. The prices for the food, such as dim sum start around the teens, which is definitely on the expensive end. I would give it a try, say during Restaurant Week to see if the food matches the ambiance and worthy of the price."

Natasha U.,/user_details?userid=r34WTuxQ8H5I-eWR6bl3Tw,"Richmond, VA",3/2/2008,4,"Asian Fusion at its best.  Went on a Friday night for a group dinner. You've got a nice spacious bar with plenty of seats to hang out in as you walk in the door, while you wait for you table.  Drinks are pricey and so is the food, so if you don't have money burning in your pocket, skip it.  But, I think it's worth it to dine here for experience and presentation. The food was well-prepared and the service was tops.  If you don't want the same ol thing and want something different and exciting, I'd try this place out.  Enjoyed it."
Nicole L.,/user_details?userid=A_OETe5Xr26FTNRPkRQ4zw,"Washington, DC",6/24/2011,4,"Our first night at NYC, I finally checked out Buddakan. I hate to say this but everything NYC does it better! There were lots of well-dressed people but it was a relaxing ambience. We decided to have a few appetizers and drinks before heading to another place. I had a few glasses of the Malbec which was good. The menu was a surprise to me it was all chinese, that's was unusual because most places like such would have a Asian fusion menu including sushi. I decided to try the peking duck salad. The frisee was lightly dressed with rice wine vinegar the type that was used in sushi rice. It was mildly acidic and was not overwhelming. The pieces of duck meat and crispy skins were scattered throughout the salad. The duck meat was cooked perfectly not dry and chewy. The skins retained the crispiness that had a good crunch. The music was good, much better than Jane for me."

Jenny C.,/user_details?userid=tZEPCxZSImv2wqbO0dpRCQ,"New York, NY",3/17/2018,2,"Didn't love this place...at all. Went here because it's difficult to find a spacious restaurant for a large group in the city without having to do prix fixe. I made a reservation for 12, but the day before had to add another person. Was told by whomever answered the phone that they would be able to add another person with no problem and to mention it at check-in. First impression was a bad start upon arrival. No one in our party was greeted by the 3 hosts. They looked up and had that, ""what do you want"" kind of look. Mind you, we were all dressed up and it was a family dinner with age range of 3-78 yrs. I told the hostess about the addition and she said they could squeeze us in but it would pose a problem. I added one child. Didn't think it would be an issue. But I guess at that point it was. Also turns out it was the same person I spoke to on the phone.  Left a bad taste in my mouth from the start. Then at least 30 min to be seated and our whole party was there. On to dinner...our waitress seemed ok. We told her we wanted to order a la carte, but she kept pushing us to get prix fixe. I'll give her credit for not including the children, but we had a couple of food allergies, a picky eater, and others who didn't have a large appetite, hence choosing Buddakan because of a la carte for a large group. There were some other issues with the meal which were discussed with the manager. No resolution to it though. Wouldn't come back ever. In hindsight eating next door at Chelsea Market with a plethora of options at a fraction of the price with better food (but of course with lack of ambience) would have been a better experience. If going to pretentious eating establishments with matching pretentious patrons and overpriced food is your thing, this is the perfect place! Two stars for large space and having a couple of good dishes."

Tiah M.,/user_details?userid=sf1f10TEOF8GZ2xKT71vXQ,"Roosevelt, NY",11/29/2018,2,"Dined here last night for my birthday and from start to finish I can honestly say wasn't that great. We had a 8:00pm reservation for 8 and we did not get seated until 9pm. We were told at 8:20 we were waiting on the previous party to pay their check and leave, but 8:45 came around and we were told that 7 of the 8 in the previous party left, but we were still waiting on the last person to leave. I mean common sense will tell you not to hold up another party of 8 for one person when you can simply ask them if they would mind moving to smaller table. Ok fast forward to after we were finally seated, the server brought us champagne for the inconvenience which was nice and took our order for drinks and apps, but that even took forever to come. The food was terribly bland and not worth its price. This was not my first time dining here, which is why i expected a fabulous experience like the last,  but this time they missed the mark. Although the decor and atmosphere is fabulous I will not be returning. Totally not worth it."

She explained everything thoroughly and gave excellent recommendations. This was a birthday celebration and this location was perfect. It's a very dressy restaurant with a vibrant atmosphere. I highly recommend the general tso's dumplings. Be warned, it is piping hot in the middle and unless you put the whole thing in your mouth, you might end up with it dripping down your shirt. The tuna tartare spring rolls are also amazing. Good flavor and smooth texture. The Cantonese steamed Sole was very good, but my favorite part personally was the vegetables in the sauce. I ordered the charred fillet of beef. The flavor was good but it was a little tough. The mustard sauce that comes with it is phenomenal. We ordered the lobster fried rice and the vegetable fried rice (one rice was enough for 2 people but there were 3 of us so we had some leftovers). Both were great, but I thought the flavors in the vegetable rice came out more. I had the chocolate pistachio cremoso for dessert and it was delicious. Rich flavors and lots of textures. You can really taste the pistachio and the sweetness of the chocolate is cut with the tartness of the cherries. I'd come here over and over again."

The Mongolian Lamb Chops would've been perfect if they weren't slightly overcooked. The short ribs were tender and the sauce was sweet like a thick barbeque sauce. Overall I would come back here again for sure!"

Try the rock shrimp, pork dumplings, beef lo men...everything I've had I've enjoyed. Drinks are yummy too."

The Lobster spring rolls dim sum was delicious... packed full of lobster and shrimp. The whole sea bass really made the night for me and my guests- well seasoned with great smokey flavor.  Even the brocccoli side dish was incredible. Also highly recommend the spicy yellowtail appetizer- melt in your mouth good. Everything was fresh,  flavorful and plentiful.  Their specialty drinks for $17 were not that great, I won't order those again.  But all in all, I can't wait to return."
Danny C.,/user_details?userid=3lEv600VRwUhGMkyaSwT0Q,"Stamford, CT",6/1/2016,3,"Amazing space. If I wrote a review the first time I came with friends they would have got 5 stars. If the first time I came was the most recent time, they would have got 1 star. I'm giving three because I know how much potential they have. Service was passable, but not for a renowned restaurant like this. Plus the direction of food quality seems to be headed down a bad slope. Let's hope they rebound because the food used to be so good. Will try again and hopefully I can update my review for the better."

The staff was extra friendly, likely to avoid making the lonely diner feel like an uncomfortable loser. They succeeded. Short ribs, chili lime crab, and the pistachio/ice cream dessert (can't remember the name) were all unique. I'd recommend all 3. Only downside was the bill, but I knew that going in."

Lucienne D.,/user_details?userid=YX8cVj2XxRRVSUn0qJFJeg,"Hoboken, NJ",1/24/2018,5,"Had a great b-day party here tonight!  Started out at the bar with Steve, the totally wonderful, awesome bartender who makes magical Old Fashioneds. Love him! Tore myself away from this cozy bar to meet my family and friends for dinner which started with no less than 10 appetizers. The lobster spring rolls, General Tso's dumplings, fois gras dumplings, oxtail dumplings, and short rib and scallion pancakes are just so yummy, its hard to stop here. The cauliflower lollipops are lovely and tasty, and the Peking Duck was cooked to perfection and unfussy in its classical presentation. Just good the way it is. This is a NYC establishment and yes, quite a scene, but oh, so unfaltering in its excellence. The atmosphere is fun and edgy and the service attentive and sweet. A wonderful chocolate pistachio ice cream dessert added some calories and a little more birthday cheer to an already perfect dinner.  I will be back."
A.R. L.,/user_details?userid=3cSyRShzXRH01Nj0rrBkNg,"Brooklyn, NY",5/18/2018,5,"I've been here several times and it does not disappoint!  Our standard orders are the lobster egg roll, Lobster fried rice, the sweet and crispy shrimp, the short rib, and the tuna tartar spring roll."
Jeffrey M.,/user_details?userid=sb9UyKJ19RXBWMtjglvWGQ,"Los Angeles, CA",8/25/2009,4,"Really nice place, expensive ass drinks.. But the food is legit and the portions are pretty fair.. It wasn't one of those high end restaurants that charge you an arm and a leg and give you cat food sized portions in return.. I had the Calamari Salad to start my meal off (which was excellent) and my entree was the Grilled Pork Tenderloin which was great too.. If it wasn't for the birthday girl, we wouldn't have eaten at such an expensive place during my NY trip (the bill was over $400 for 8 people!) but I'm glad I got to experience some sort of NY fine dining on my trip nonetheless.."

Drinks nothing blew our mind,  i would just recommend getting a bottle of wine but the scallops and edamame and the crying chocolate... I will be back for sure ... My birthday was welcomed well."
Sara B.,/user_details?userid=3a4AdQC6Yqsd4Eutmg670w,"Glen Oaks, NY",5/16/2016,3,"So I live in NY and got caught into the hype of this place. ""Gossip Girl was shot here-""ooooh. I can see why one would want to shoot an episode here, the ambiance is amazing. It is huge on the inside. The outside doesn't look all that, just a big, black box looking thing on the corner of a city block. Now let's move to the important stuff; the food. It was OKAY. Did not meet my expectations. Small portion sizes that'll leave a dent in your wallet. My friend and I ordered the jumbo shrimp (had 5 shrimps) and our other friend ordered the black cod. They all tasted good, but weren't worth the price. You're basically paying for the seating.. 3 entrees, 2 sides, one dessert & tip= $180. You do the math."

The food is very well prepared,  and I almost couldn't contain myself once I began eating. Very good restaurant for dates."

Safi C.,/user_details?userid=4EenGlFF-rDg0AZAFSQ6SA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/7/2016,2,"Typical Asian Fusion eye-catching decor. However it is an incredibly large space, I'm not sure if it allows for private functions but it would be terrific to host an event here. The service is apt; doesn't ignore you nor does it linger too long. The food is ""A-OK"" but to be honest between Spice Market, Tao, Macau and the unending list of lavish and oversaturated Asian-Fusion restaurants Buddakan was nothing out of the ordinary."

Buddakan was a cool experience coupled with very tasty food. As mentioned, the atmosphere makes for a perfect night out. We ordered a good mix of dishes and were very impressed across the board. The lobster rolls were HUGE and filled with big pieces of lobsters. We ordered two dumpling samplers to begin along with pork buns and cauliflower lollipops, all were excellent. The blackened cod was out of this world, definitely a must order if you like seafood. The fish tasted like butter. We also ordered the steak, two veggie dishes and a fried rice. It was all incredible. We had four people and didn't feel like there was too much food because portions are not huge. They also had a great drink selection with creative cocktail choices and an extensive wine list."

Went there for my GF birthday with a party of 5 recently. When we first arrived we were greeted by a very hospitable hostess who checked us in and made us wait in the waiting lounge/bar till our table was ready. We waited a total of 5 minutes before we were directed to our table. We sat at the really long table at the center of the restaurant which kind of reminds you of a scene at Hogwarts in Harry Potter lol. Service was incredible from beginning to finish, very attentive staff and really friendly. The food was amazing I enjoyed every dish that was ordered by us that night. I will definitely be going back here again"

Surprisingly easy to get a reservation for 5 at 8pm. Service is spotty - people up front greeting, coat check, etc. were quite aloof and after a minute of waiting at coat check I had to say ""excuse me, do I check my coat here,"" despite that no one was around me. Our waiter, however, was fantastic. Good drinks menu and extensive food menu. We all split everything: pork dumplings (the least impressive item), spare ribs (by far the best), scallion pancake, tuna tartare tacos, mushroom noodles, crab fried rice, stir-fried greens, shrimp, and of course the Peking duck. The Peking duck was truly exceptional, and in hindsight - we should almost have just ordered 2 of those and scrapped the rest. We skipped dessert, because they do start PUMPING the music later in the evening (god I sound so old). Fun place to come though!"

Kelsey F.,/user_details?userid=ig1MdCkhqzuH5DPuufm-9A,"Boston, MA",1/26/2014,4,"Buddakan's great for late night fun. We arrived around 11:30pm and had dinner in the upstairs lounge. Waitstaff was generally attentive. Excellent dim sum, but the chow fun noodles with mushrooms lacked flavor. I'd go back for small plates, but wouldn't make a dinner out of it again. A good place to keep in mind for late night snacking if you're hungry but not quite ready to give up the party vibe by going home."
S.s. B.,/user_details?userid=0AoOkZKdfmzjdJij0dK4YA,"Boston, MA",1/25/2014,4,Enjoyed the Restaraunt very much. The food was delicious and the selection was extensive.  Service was excellent. Servers paid very close attention to special needs diets in our group.  Bathrooms were a little too dark.
Mary Kay M.,/user_details?userid=hu8Y8YEDDq5e_bIf18aLzw,"Honeoye Falls, NY",10/7/2016,4,"The food at Buddakan was great. The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of 5 is I prefer the Philadelphia location.  Missed the passion flier martini and wasabi sorbet. However, the Mongolian lamb chops where superb as well as the Peking duck fried rice and other dishes we tried. Highly recommend."

Micheal J A.,/user_details?userid=6p91LRC_17gFMD78uV3ibw,"Fort Worth, TX",12/22/2014,5,Very nice and the food was great... The fried duck was good... The wait time was excessive despite the reservation but the manager made the effort to ease the delay with complimentary drinks

Gladwin G.,/user_details?userid=NzvTj52xOnS7MuuliwY4Kw,"Mineola, NY",11/29/2015,3,"This place is on the corner and looks like an old warehouse kind of building. You may find street parking or paid garage parking. Since we were a group of about 11, we made a reservation and were promptly seated once our entire party arrived. We were seated at a community table in the basement floor. The food was mediocre and the portions were fairly small for the price that was paid (amounted to about ~$40 per person, without drinks). I wasn't a huge fan of the food but the setting was pretty decent. If you search well enough, you can find better food at hole in the wall places. You may need to dress a little nicer if you are coming here."

Brian S.,/user_details?userid=YhhMZe-zYH37vInC3PnRDQ,"Prairieville, LA",11/22/2015,3,"If it's about the food 5.5 stars! I recommend jade shrimp dumplings, grilled broccoli prawn noodles and spicy egg plant and tofu . The tea smoked spare ribs were delicious but not unique. The prices were reasonable as long as you didn't order fish or meat entree. The downside is if your unlucky enough to be seated upstairs, your likely crammed side by side. You might as well eat in the bar. Go for lower seating. Also waiter was robotic always saying the same thing. Doubt order specialty drinks because they seem to be devoid of alcohol and for $16 I expect a nice buzz! Still an amazing restaurant !"
Lia N.,/user_details?userid=vu3ynxKPXFtK-zjnRwza1A,"Burbank, CA",1/12/2016,5,One of the most elegant places to dine! Gorgeous venue with amazing food! A must see if you are ever in New York City!

We arrived at the appointed time for our reservation and have never been treated so rudely. We have great experiences in NYC but not here. We were seated at the bar and no table ready for over half an hour.  We decided to stay, as was extremely busy, and thought we would give them a break, but then left as the place was dirty and the crowd was questionable. Went to 21, which was the usual fabulous elegant and fun dinner. We will never return nor will send any friends to this place as is a tourist trap.  We gave it a chance though. Not for the well restaurant educated NYC people."
Melissa G.,/user_details?userid=lFWX29jngNCg3_uJJsug1w,"Queens, NY",1/9/2016,5,"This restaurant was one of the most awesome dining experiences I've ever had (and I dine out often). The attention to detail and excellence tells you that you are someplace special and that you are special for being there. The most amazing things to ever touch my palette were their edamame dumplings. I ate them slowly. Very...very...slowly. I did not want them to end. So be sure to include them when you are ordering. Service, food, and decor is impeccable. Worth every penny."

The place is massive and has beautiful decor but the food and service even better. We came with a large grip and considered the tasting menu but opted for the more diverse menu options. The cod was my favorite dish as well as the tuna tartar spring rolls and dumplings.

For desert the crying chocolate and the passion fruit mouse  wonderful ."

Portions are large and good for sharing. We had the following: Lobster Egg Rolls, Scallion Pancake, Chinese Sausage Fried Rice, Lobster Fried Rice, Sizzling Short Ribs, Soft Shell Crab, and a Whole Peking Duck. And yes there is more...for dessert Crying Chocolate Cake, and the Carrot Cake. Everything was mouthwatering and I could eat for days here. The Crying Chocolate Cake was NOT sharing size and I am glad I ordered my own. If you love chocolate and desserts, you are guaranteed to love this one. Those who like carrot cake may be disappointed. It did not taste all that original. I will definitely visit them again when in NYC!"

Monica B.,/user_details?userid=X4bq73Cn5oRp5CaAA6ypIg,"Phoenix, AZ",7/30/2015,4,Such a fun atmosphere! We came a little early to enjoy drinks at the bar. The drinks were good but all of them are on the sweet side. (Between the party of 4 we tried about 5 specialty cocktails.) The bartender was a little short with us. This could be due to the place being packed. Once we were seated the the staff was very friendly. All the food was amazing! Loved the dumplings!! I would absolutely go back and recommend to friends but next time I'll stick with wine.

For starters we ordered a variety of appetizers, which included the spicy rock shrimp, smoked ribs and a several Dim Sum dumpling selections. The Entrees were also very good. It was my first time eating duck and it was very good. The food was well seasoned and tender.  Buddakan is definitely on my list of top 5 restaurants, and I will be returning."

I felt like I was on a theater set of Sleep No More, dining and drinking. Truly memorable. Moreover, the food -- especially the duck salad, pepper beef and edamame dumplings -- was delicious. I didn't give the experience a 5-star because check-in was overwhelming and a zoo. Further, while service was generally responsive, they messed up our check somehow, resulting in one of the guests absorbing a $400 tab. Ouch."

V B.,/user_details?userid=GluKc0LMQ-73t8qfGr56zw,"Albany, NY",4/10/2015,4,"The wait was ridiculously long for my dinner reservation, about 2 hours which was ridiculous, but the food was excellent. The manager felt terrible and gave us free desserts, and he came up to us multiple times to apologize. But, otherwise, great atmosphere, good food."
Cameron S.,/user_details?userid=_Mpu-HCb-eAaV4TaRxnvaA,"Annapolis, MD",6/17/2018,3,"It was so loud in there. I'm young so I am used to being in loud restaurants and bars, but it was unbearable even for me. We asked when we made our reservation to sit in the downstairs area where the chandeliers are but they did not put us down there when the day came. Our table was so close to the other tables it was difficult to slide in. As soon as we sat down they asked for our order and then when we told them they brought it all to us in 3-5 minutes. That was extremely disappointing because we wanted the appetizers to come first and for the dinner to be special - not a 30 minute event like it ended up being. The food was good, but for the price I wanted an experience and in that regard they really disappointed me."
Kate R.,/user_details?userid=yx9PQyNCt1vTtrlW89WZCw,"Manhattan, NY",1/24/2016,4,"This is one of the more expensive places to eat in New York and it is crazy DELICIOUS. And has giant chandeliers and huge murals all of which says ""rich people eat here."" Yes The crowd was a bit banker heavy but the food made the douchebags and their model dates worth ignoring. You can easily pay fifty bucks a head at a normal Italian place somewhere on 9th avenue or you can save up and pay 75 bucks each and eat the hell out of a menu wherever dish is a work of art. They do family style and encourage you to over  order so don't get crazy with the upsell . But we had three apps for four people-- the pork dumplings divine the fish dumplings omg the cauliflower lollipops so fun to eat and then the mains were all delish. Even the dessert was incredible which is a standout at Asian places where it's usually a dollop of ice cream and a lichee nut. Best tarte a tin outside of France I've had paired with soy sauce ice cream was so umami!!"

Yann P.,/user_details?userid=E8H8KHzMWfxsRzn0xuy_Yg,"Flushing, NY",5/24/2013,4,If your want to eat at a beautiful place with an Asian fusion this is the place to eat. With the giant golden statue of Buddha in the middle and lightly dimmed place creates a great place for a nice date night. It has multiple locations in ny as sell as Philly. The food is delicately made along with a twist on the traditional. My fave was prob the taro dimson on a stick... Along with the steak flat rice noodles. But I gotta say its a bit on the pricy side of course it was my boss bday and her boss paid for us all I think the price for us 12 people was well over 3G. But if you have a special date it would be a great place to go to.. Then again we had dishes after dished and shots along with it.

The decor and aesthetic of the restaurant was to-die-for. Upon our arrival and await of seating we were escorted to an area where the bar was located. I indulged in the cocktail named ""Fate"" which I absolutely loved, my friend got the cocktail ""Haze"" which she absolutely hated and sent back. We were escorted to our seats and introduced to our waiter (unfortunately I cannot recall his name) who was very pleasant and helpful. While skimming through the menu we were informed of the share-table nature of the dining. With knowledge of portion sizes, we decided to each order our very own food choices. I ordered the Rock Shrimp and the Dungeness Crab Sticky. I thoroughly enjoyed the rice and I couldn't stop eating it. The shrimp were okay, a good kick but I felt the sauce was lacking additional flavor. Reminded me of Hooter's hot wing sauce. At the table, we ordered the cocktail charm which was very tasty and arrived in a champagne flute with an array of berries. Others ordered the lobster fried rice, crispy shrimp, chile chicken, and the vegetable rice with coconut froth. No complaints from others on their choices. Overall I enjoyed my experience."

Talha A.,/user_details?userid=B3Bm_1AU_IpEPEVz6d46ig,"New Hyde Park, NY",3/2/2015,3,"I've gone here twice, very nice ambiance and scenery for birthdays/anniversary celebrations.  Definitely recommend having a reservation for peak hours/nights, otherwise wait in the bar/lounge area until your table opens up, again its a nice social scene.  Lobster egg rolls, dumpling, lobster fried rice, glazed alaskan black cod, black bean scallops, shrimp and lobster chow fun...have had all of these and probably more, we thoroughly enjoyed them while there but cannot pinpoint (in retrospect) which was the best or award winning.  It'll wow you while you are there but its nothing you will crave or write home about, its not bad by any means, pricing is typical for NYC as is their portion size, its just not mouthwatering-will wait for 2 hours-crave at 2am type of food, the ambiance, especially if you sit downstairs is very inviting and adds to your enjoyable dining experience there. You might feel rushed by the staff should you go at peak hours/nights so plan to eat at your own pace and enjoy the night so you get your moneys worth!"

The space we sat in had 40' ceilings, and a very luxurious and dark interior. It was certainly a pleasure to just sit there. Service was excellent and attentive. The food was very good, although ranging from excellent for the variety of appetizers and shared plates we enjoyed, to simply so-so for the meat entrees. The latter still had exceptionally tasty elements, it was just the texture of the meat was less than ideal. Overall, a great experience."

Alba O.,/user_details?userid=1YxTBEbQZ0kgZUxLD5VtfQ,"New York, NY",2/11/2018,3,"Great food. The prices are justifiable as you are getting a chef quality meal. There are balanced flavors. I got duck rice and lomein and were just delicious. The reason why I give it 3 stars is because even though majority of the party was there they still wouldn't sit us down and we were going to start ordering anyways. But... after the fact we were all there, we still had to wait for someone to get us. Also, the hosts and coat check had an attitude. They saw me standing there (I wanted to inform them we were all there) and they would look away or pretended to be busy on their screen or simply chatted with their coworker. You gotta be kidding me. As a former hostess and waitress you just have to really hate your job and life to take it out on people who just simply came to eat, not to deal with your snarky a**. Anyways, it's just the environment really turned me off and I wouldn't go back but definitely try it one time for the food."

Zoila N.,/user_details?userid=S2yyTo_R2aCTrmUjEhe9BQ,"Anaheim, CA",3/5/2011,3,"Maybe because of all the hype this place got I was expecting more out of our dinner/experience.  I definitely love the cocktails/decor.  The food was not much to write home about though, everything was pretty salty.  If I ever go back I will try the edemame dumplings because thats what everyone seems to rave about.  Its very hard to give this place a superb rating because I have had chinese food that has tasted much better than what I had for half the price of what I paid."
Tony T.,/user_details?userid=hOzOTyBQHk4WXmiTGaOy4Q,"Seattle, WA",6/20/2011,3,"The ambiance is dark and club like, which is OK for dinner but not optimal. The appetizers were good and I would recommend the hoisin glazed pork belly. It was sweet, salty, and spicy melt in your mouth pork in a fluffy bun. The Mao po tofu was greasy, you can do just as well from your local Chinese take out. The black cod was good but a little overcooked. Come for the decor and the scene, but don't expect to get your socks knocked off by the food. It's good but not great Chinese food."
Michael C.,/user_details?userid=vhGokL-gPFlE35KV7PVHdQ,"Somers, NY",6/1/2012,2,"I had heard good things about BUDDAKAN and couldn't wait to try it.  First of all, the decor is stunning and the menu offers some of the most interesting choices I've seen in a while.  It's too bad the food doesn't live up to the hype.  The much-touted chili rock shrimp are no more than greasy fried shrimp in mayonnaise.  The BoBo platter had some good items, some bad.  A ginger puree on the lamb chops was excellent but scarce.  The short rib with Asian pear had the pear chopped on the side...did it not occur to the chef to perhaps add some pear to the overly salty sauce?  The best part of the meal was the tofu cheesecake.  If you're looking for a night out with friends and a great bar scene, then try Buddakan.  If food matters, go elsewhere."
Jonah K.,/user_details?userid=tXhscxwFTd-ayLTdPx_2yA,"Pompano Beach, FL",7/2/2012,3,"I've eaten here a few times, and the prices are very high. The quality of the food is good and the presentation is interesting. Great service and a very cool venue. There is nothing particularly standout with the menu or drinks, but it's an interesting spot anyways. I would rather go to other locations for more interesting food in general."
Lisa R.,/user_details?userid=LnZUtFx6qTWs8NV6lAARxQ,"Denver, CO",7/20/2012,4,"I have been here twice and each time it was ah-mazing! The first time was dinner and drinks with a girlfriend.  This last time was for my big birthday bash (party of 12, mind you).  Both experiences were great. Here's what you must, must try:  lobster egg rolls (yes, decadent and worth every penny), edamame dumplings (sounds simple but tastes extraordinary), Miso cod (people rave about this and I'm proudly one of them) and finish your meal with the banana bread pudding (I'm not a huge dessert person, but this is bomb).  Finally the cocktails are also a treat as well, but I tend to stick with their ""Fate"" concoction and find myself struggling to try anything else.  Also, for my bday bash, we had some dietary restrictions as well as folks uninterested in the prix-fixe yet the waitress was very accommodating and made the night all the better. Great place if you want to do it up in Chelsea."
Barb H.,/user_details?userid=-BOEtfrrhm_1bsxQohJBKg,"Bridgeport, CT",3/9/2015,5,"Great service, yummy food, and beautiful atmosphere. Very classy. Highly recommend."
Greg K.,/user_details?userid=S2naArQMWldebWTPbrKi5w,"Fairport, NY",10/1/2015,5,"I had a business party of 6 and we all ordered the prix fix menu plus a few extra appetizers.  I was concerned we would be light on quantity but it was a large amount of food and every...single..dish was excellent.  Creative, flavorful and big enough to share.  The ambiance, especially in the big center room, is impressive.  My only criticism was there an unusually long gap between the last entree and dessert."
Trae W.,/user_details?userid=MV3Tw4DiipBTXETyOZtfBQ,"Springfield Gardens, Queens, NY",11/30/2015,5,"This. Place. Was. Amazing. We had 10pm reservations. We sat down around 10:10-10:15... Our waitress (her name I forgot sorry) was great. She knew everything about the menus and what the food tastes like. She offer great suggestions (clearly up selling us) that we took her advice on and it was on point. I never had shrimp toast before and it was to die for. Also, I had scallops for the first time and I'm glad I had it here. Definitely set the bar high for any other place I may go to try it. We were checked on my (what I believe) was a manager which was refreshing. The items are costly but well worth it!! I would go again in a heart beat. Wow!"

Rehan M.,/user_details?userid=y7lgQbi0sBK2J71WFl2weA,"Fairfield, CT",2/3/2016,3,The food is fantastic the three stars are only for the fact that they made us wait about 2 hours on a table when I have made reservations online earlier.What is the point of making reservations then if they still gonna make you wait!
Nikki N.,/user_details?userid=Spgk_xNArJiV3ZyMND2-3w,"Tustin, CA",9/27/2015,5,"We made a reservation here for our NYC trip. We're usually not a big fan of fusion cuisine but due to recommendation from our good friends, we're willing to give it a try. We ordered their new dim sum dish, foie gras dumpling with consumme. The foie gras flavor was subtle but pretty good and spot on. For entres, we tried their lobster fried rice and char-broiled beef. They were both delicious! The service was awesome! We tried the benevolence cocktail, it was yum and refreshing! Will definitely come back again!"
Anjie M.,/user_details?userid=mrnZ2M8zf3cHEuwxZ_3UfQ,"Jamaica, NY",2/2/2016,5,"Where to begin, if could dine here everyday I would be delighted. Absolutely nothing bad to say about this restaurant. Prices are a little on the higher side but worth it ($468.00) bill for my 2 daughters, myself & hubby. Would definitely return to this location  because it's closer as to the one in AC which is equally amazing place to dine in"
Noño Z.,/user_details?userid=QEDpiiCtelB246t3Y8Zj1w,"New York, NY",10/21/2014,5,"I love this place!! The atmosphere is very fun and modern and the interior design, decorations are very cool! Too be honest, I didn't have my hopes up on the food... I never really liked any Asian fusion food, but the food they have there is amazing!! We had a duck fried rice, a king crab soup and two cocktails, and they were all delicious. I would definitely go back again, and no wonder they have much better reviews than Hakkasan and TAO. oh, but one thing, I don't think the service there is very good at all. The girl who served us really didn't come by much and every time she did she didn't really care what we said and just walked by very quickly ...."

Casey H.,/user_details?userid=U9u_PfQm-ovEwYRwNX16BA,"Raleigh, NC",9/11/2014,4,"Went here on a Friday night and got dinner reservations 4 weeks in advance and had to settle for 9:45P as the earliest available. When we go there, the place was packed and of course we had to wait another 30 minutes to be seated. Definitely worth the wait though. We tried a lot of the smaller plates and everything we had was phenomenal. I have to say that my favorite was the Tuna Tartare Spring Roll - I would go back just for that! We split a bottle of wine and probably got about 6 small plates and the bill was not as out of control as I thought it might be. Our waitress was also really nice and super helpful with our ordering. I would definitely go back if I could get an earlier res!"

Hands down, if your looking for a classy sexy place to dine with WONDERFUL appetizers and entrees go here. All of their rice is super good, I eat the chilli king crab, braised beef on the pancake, lobster egg roll, rock shrimp, OMG THE GENERAL TSO DUMPLINGS  so good.  Go with rich people (unlike me) so you can try everything and melt every time."
Gabriela C.,/user_details?userid=tkj25kkgXwJhTWnXcW83HA,"São Paulo, Brazil",6/13/2016,5,"Incredible ambiance, delicious food! The first time I visited Buddakan I did not know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised by the trendy decor, cool atmosphere, and amazing food. The first time was definitely the best of all, however I had great experiences there every other time I went. I definitely recommend the Edamame Dumplings!"
Rachael L.,/user_details?userid=PzVRbDeasRsd1VSrvFcc1A,"Minneapolis, MN",4/13/2016,5,Wow! This place is great. Recently went for a late dinner on my trip to NYC. NEED RESERVATIONS. The almond bread pudding is the best thing I have ever eaten. Really good atmosphere and crowd.

Overpriced overhyped tourist trap here , in a city blessed with great places to eat ! Don't waste your money here ."

Tuna Tatar is fresh but the taste is a little odd, reminds me of deviled eggs all the time. The skins of Juicy dumplings are a little thick and tough. crying chocolate and pumpkin Doughnuts are both delicious."

Janna R.,/user_details?userid=51fPO2J1mD_4eZ3M4wRC5Q,"Bronx, NY",11/10/2015,5,Absolutely worth every dime! This Asian fusion elegant/classy restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Came here for a friends birthday and was pleasantly surprised at how lavish this place is. My friends and I shared a couple of the dim sum and were completely satisfied. The portions are good for a group of 5. Everything was delicious. The drinks were amazing. The music and ambiance is perfect. The waitress was lovely and very accommodating. If you are in NYC please make it to this place!

The place is gorgeous and the staff was super attentive. We decided to do a set menu and they accommodated everyones food allergies/sensitivities - they even brought out alternatives for people who couldn't eat certain things. The dishes came out fast and every bite was delicious. It was pricey but we left full and smiling, so it was worth every penny. I didn't even know what I was eating half the time and I loved it all!"

This pretentious high end restaurant with tacky decor just lacks the concept of service and hospitality. Our waitress never asked us how the food was and was never around for us to ask anything."
William B.,/user_details?userid=11UACyZrRn5Fq4MqSnvhbw,"Newark, NJ",3/30/2018,5,Its my favorite restaurant in NYC. Why? The aesthetic is unbeatable with a scale unimaginable (bigly); food is out of this world; service impeccable; drinks are amazing.

Courtney R.,/user_details?userid=rBXtnb1_1I4lEgIFMNKjuA,"Shutesbury, MA",4/8/2015,5,"Had yet another incredible meal at Buddakan on April 7. Kevin was our waiter and he was ever so charming and attentive. My dear friend and I ordered the pork dumplings, the edamame dumplings, Sweet and Spicy crispy shrimp, peanut noodles and the green asian stir fry. Yet again the meal blew my mind and impressed my friend who is a cook herself. For dessert we chose the Passion Fruit dessert mentioned in my last review (please refer to earlier review for details). Our favorite part of the meal were the pork dumplings. Crispy, spicy and a tad sweet, the dumplings were an absolute delight. The peanut noodles had quite the inventive composition but didn't do it for us. The dish was a bit dry over all ( not enough peanut sauce ) and as a whole, over powered by candied ginger bits. The shrimp and green stir fry were favorites of mine from last visit and they were as good as ever!!! We each had a specialty cocktail to drink ( names don't come to mind) and each was a superb concoction of favors! Well done, Buddakan."

Natalie W.,/user_details?userid=1x-iYCaJae0lXqnhEzeIAQ,"Caldwell, NJ",12/9/2009,5,"I love the interior of this place. I do wish the customer service at the front desk was a little friendlier. I have only been there twice, my husband took me there the first time for my birthday and we went again for a friend's birthday. The food was delicious. I liked the chilled udon with lime sorbet.... it was weird and different, but it tasted really good. I also loved the boneless spare ribs, they were amazing. They are a little pricey and everything is a la carte, but its New York. Our friends girlfriend ordered him some kind of chocolate cake. Words can not even describe how indulgent it was. I wish I had room for a second piece ha ha. It was beautifully decorated too, with gold flakes and chocolate designs on top and going around the outside.  If you know someone who is having a birthday, I suggest ordering that cake. You can thank me later!"

Our waiter was very helpful and honest about the menu and had great recommendations as to what wine goes well with what entrees etc.  They had the most adorable, delicious V.Day dessert which was a smores cake with ice cream on top and a hard chocolate shell around the ice cream!! Also AMAZING ! I cannot wait to go again ."

Yovi B.,/user_details?userid=nSKR2b9ZA-wPEwmQaqrOAQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/7/2015,3,"Went there for my birthday with a party of 10... Before we were seated everyone had to be present so we bought drinks in the waiting area by the bar. Once my party was all here, the waiter came and took us downstairs to the dining areas, which is beautifu to say the least. However, I definitely wasn't impressed with the quality or quantity of food for the price of the dishes.... The decor was beautiful got some great pics but no one really cared too much for their food. It was definitely an experience but will I be going back?  Probably not,"
Missy B.,/user_details?userid=f_uLE3MbBVDlAe6qWrsD7g,"Jersey City, NJ",2/28/2016,5,"The wait list thing can be hard to get use to so better to make a reservation.

Tina H.,/user_details?userid=7QVnMK_xSQfzdTqiJkom8A,"San Francisco, CA",3/30/2015,5,"Buddakan is incredible. If you're looking for a great venue for a small or even a large dinner party (we had a party of 20+ last time). Go to Buddakan and you won't be disappointed in the service, the impeccable food or the gorgeous ambience."

I was actually expecting to enjoy the food more unfortunately the noodles weren't that good and some of the appetizers as well. The waiter was nice but it just felt he was rushing through everything didn't give us much time to enjoy the food we were served. Everything felt rushed and to be in such a beautiful place I wanted to spend more time enjoying it.
Alisson G.,/user_details?userid=_yvmDZD2V0c1dWem2LzR3g,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",3/24/2015,5,"Absolutely love this place, I've been there more than a handful of times and I'm never dissappointed... Service is always amazing and the food so far is always very delicious and consistent."

Nesie P.,/user_details?userid=W5hS_C8NTU2JCWDpV7q3Vg,"Bronx, NY",3/20/2015,4,"Ok, so, went to this restaurant on my birthday a few weeks ago and It was very nice.  The Chili Rock shrimp and Tuna Tartare spring rolls were excellent! However, for $200.00 bucks for a dinner for 2, I would not make this spot a frequent flier on my list.  In the future, I would just order appetizers, skip the bar and keep it moving to another spot, not that it was bad, just way to much hype for the price.  But, once or twice a year will work for this spot as far as I am concerned."
Michael G.,/user_details?userid=HpueUOjUoXJsqYPogf2nAg,"Mountainside, NJ",2/17/2016,5,Great restaurant. Second time back. Big group so did family style everything.

Claudia A.,/user_details?userid=h4Uq7xxWRxOe5NCted757Q,"Miami, FL",12/26/2014,5,"I loved it! Great place! We had the edamame dumplings, lobster and crab shi Mai, shrimp dumplings, Seabass rolls, Sticky rice and my husband had his own lamb chops (all plates are small and shared). Wow. Best dumplings ever. The edamame dumplings taste and feel like puréed edamame. Definitely a must try! Seating is a bit uncomfortable but it's worth coming."
Kayla W.,/user_details?userid=G5PJOqX-nTdewFchfLBIcA,"Arlington, VA",2/15/2016,5,"Came here for a late dinner on Saturday night. Visiting from DC and knew that this place was all the rage (and of course I'd seen the first scene in sex and the city!!) this place exceeded my expectations. The service is phenomenal. Not stuffy but you can definitely expect to rub elbows with a few celebs if you're lucky. We had the dumplings (great) and the chili rock shrimp which were so yummy! Also the filet and scallops were great! The veggies in the scallop dish were the best part! We will definitely be back. Also, this is definitely a place to look your best!"
Katrina V.,/user_details?userid=r9f32rcIlAmsZmHzamfT3g,"Brooklyn, NY",11/29/2015,4,Go here if you want an expensive dinner with a trendy atmosphere. Good for birthday parties and specials occasions. The short rib was absolutely delicious. Drinks were just ok.

Nadina T.,/user_details?userid=3pecVQwAiX2qWN8Nny2cBA,"Boca Raton, FL",5/31/2015,5,A must for dinner!!! The food and atmosphere was by far one of the best restaurants I have been to. Every dish was amazing and perfectly flavored. You muuuuuust have the bread pudding.

My friend made reservations for 4 of us while visiting NYC (she's a SATC fanatic & knowing that I love the show). But it's one of those Asian fusion places that can be a hit or a miss. I guess that's why I'm giving this place more like 3.5 stars. We were wowed with the decor as the hostess sat us, thankfully, not at the communal table. The dinner  we ordered was average, I thought, nothing that really stood out. Dessert was good. As for the bathroom, it was really dark inside & could barely see myself in the mirror."

Antonija Z.,/user_details?userid=_ELIkZYS4HwWfm9D_eT4-g,"Lancaster, PA",10/24/2015,4,"Friday night was busy.. We waited for a table for 30 min (we had a previous reservation). Its a place that you can try out, for fun, but nothing special. The place is huge, and the interior is so nice. Tried it, but wouldn't go back. Its New York, so many great places to try:-)"
Nicole M.,/user_details?userid=c-0IupFovj-BLM33oSxAvA,"New York, NY",4/22/2015,5,"Atmosphere is lovely and the waiters are great. The food tastes amazing, overall a great place to enjoy time with others, but comes with a nice price tag. Well worth it in my eyes."
Heidi Jo M.,/user_details?userid=u9xUYCPq9jilsIA-tyoVTw,"Los Angeles, CA",1/3/2016,5,"THE BEST NEW YEARS EVE EVER!!! just want to take my hats off to Buddakan for throwing the most exceptional NYE party that i've been to in years!!  The food, music(even our teenagers were raving!), crowd, service was all 5-star!!  and here's the kicker:  far less $$ than other high end restaurants in the same neighborhood.   We will definitely make this our regular haunt for New Years Eve....thank you so much Buddakan for your amazing party!!"
Aly C.,/user_details?userid=CWI8DUMpOJwtmXGYcnh0rw,"Binghamton, NY",12/31/2015,4,"Food was really good, but very overpriced. The ambience is clearly what you pay for- make sure to take a good picture there! Great cocktails, great place to go on a date."
anindita s.,/user_details?userid=6SyCQyFsaU5F9RYWkLNeYQ,"Woodside, NY",8/8/2015,5,"Had a nice dinner with family. Everything was so yummy. Loved the tuna tartare spring roll, filet of beef. Bread pudding was too good."
Ron E.,/user_details?userid=0pled4JIW9jjuuMxMNkZCA,"Manhattan, NY",4/12/2015,5,I have yet to be disappointed in Biddahkan. Super great food.  Order enough! The different dishes were out ragous the cod fish and the duck salad were great!  The noodles and mushrooms were OK.
Courtney W.,/user_details?userid=rWtM_kbQqRk9WU7zVIFX1w,"Orlando, FL",10/9/2015,5,"There was nothing  here I didn't like. And we ordered a lot. The filet was the highlight of the meal. Our table was ready promptly at the time of our reservation. Our server, Kevin, was outstanding and all of his recommendations were delicious."
Tanya M.,/user_details?userid=4E6WGB8XZrSa_26UcVTSvQ,"Brooklyn, NY",9/12/2014,5,"Buddakhan was a phenomenal dining experience. I had come across a few yelp reviews that described the atmosphere as 'sexy'. Was not sure how that adjective fits a description for a restaurant but it definitely lived up to it. Very swanky and unique decor. The service was great and loved that it was family style so there are opportunities to try many items on their fantastic menu. They also had a very cool cocktail menu. Hard to pick the highlights because frankly everything we tried was pretty impressive. Some things that stood out were the pork buns (melted in your mouth), the sea bass (cooked perfectly), calamari salad, and tuna tartar spring rolls. Other items that we ordered that were great were: tuna tartar app, sizzling short rib, chocolate cake, rock shrimp and edamame dumplings. The almond bread pudding was also a highlight. While I don't usually like bread pudding, this one may have converted me. Overall, I would say Buddakhan is a must for city foodies!"
Elsa G.,/user_details?userid=PcfRHXNXeplAKWW9cZeFEw,"Manhattan, NY",1/24/2015,5,I love this fancy place they have realky good food and good wine it's perfect for a date and the place is amazing :))
Sardorsy L.,/user_details?userid=CtRt15gHRn5IunQgMBrQ9Q,"Sunset Park, NY",12/24/2015,4,Food: good presentation and taste but didn't wow me. I have never expected to have a yummy in a Asian fusion restaurant. Maybe i have just got use to it. Service: good. Ambience: I wish I could give them more than 5 stars just on their interior design.  We enjoyed it.
Reesie R.,/user_details?userid=iniAye73-Wax5U1TKTUN2g,"Manhattan, NY",6/1/2015,5,"I love Buddahkan!!!  The food here is delicious!  I recently came for a girls' night and had outstanding food!  Their cocktails are excellent.  I started my night with an amazing cocktail (see photo).  You absolutely must get the black cod; it is the best I have ever had.  In fact, it might be the best piece of fish I have ever tasted.  Perfectly glazed, flaky, and moist.  Amazing.  Other highlights of the meal:  general tso dumplings (can't get enough of them!), short ribs are thick and savory (a tad overcooked but who cares; was yummy), wok tossed noodles with prawns, and greens (they were the least exciting but I needed some veggies).  And the desserts.   Oh the desserts - again, outstanding!!!  Make sure to leave room for dessert!  Not your typical Asian dessert fare.  The chocolate mousse is amazing - get it.  But my absolute favorite is the cremoso - it's literally a party in your mouth.  Okay, time for me to eat there again STAT!!!"
Nicole J.,/user_details?userid=meh3G7iaXNs9ksl0mgDmBA,"Manhattan, NY",1/23/2015,4,"Beautiful ambiance and superb service. The staff is very attentive. This a great place to take someone you want to #impress, or a #date. The lobster friend rice was delicious. I ordered the pepper sea bass and didn't realize it was fried. Tasted good, but steamed would've been so much better. Next time I would try something different. I suggest asking questions about your order before you place it. My drink and dessert were good, too. Yes, we indulged that night."
EJ J.,/user_details?userid=cel3MO0CEb5hOPrQZxMNnQ,"New York, NY",2/26/2015,4,"It is how refined Chinese food should be, not too many place you can WOW people with Chinese food these days.  And by WOW-ing im not talking about the food.  Its the atmosphere.  It def has better food than Tao or Buddah Bar."
Janet H.,/user_details?userid=E8uLggYJbmYbziDY1Wxsvg,"Jersey City, NJ",5/30/2015,3,"It's fancy but alright experience. If I'd come back, I wouldn't bother to order dim sum. Main dishes' taste matches the place profile."

I was the one throwing the party for my best friend, and from the very beginning It was a wonderful experience i was put in touch with the event coordinator Cara and she was awesome she accommodated me bringing my own cake and made special menus for the event....any chance I get to go to Buddakan for their amazing food is always a pleasure!!!!"

Nicole S.,/user_details?userid=POmyqedLjt06Gfajf1of5Q,"Alameda, CA",1/17/2015,4,Go here and enjoy the beauty of the restaurant. The main dining room is gorgeous  and overall ambiance and style of the restaurant is amazing. It is always packed so make sure to make a reservation or come ready to wait. Everyone at Buddakan is nice and the wait staff was helpful in ordering. The food had some mixed reviews-- we started with the pork belly dim sum - which was delicious. We were not as impressed with the lobster fried rice - tons of lobster but lacking in flavor. We had the lamb dan dan noodles which were okay. We did enjoy the crap hot pot- it had a very good flavor. Overall a great place to enjoy an evening and it really does feel very NYC - so good to bring guests from out of town.

What an amazing place, atmosphere and menu. Was pleasantly surprised to the see the pavlova (de-constructed) on the menu. No quicker way to a Kiwi's heart ;) The bartender who served us before being lead to our table was incredibly helpful and went through the entire menu giving advice as to what were his favourites etc."
Renee A.,/user_details?userid=130U59fAlzU1rrZ65MEPIg,"Brooklyn, NY",6/24/2014,4,"Pricey? Hands down, YES! Worth it? You bet your sweet palette! Sometimes you have to treat yourself to the good stuff because the corner Chinese spot in your hood IS NOT making these boneless spare ribs like this or LOBSTER fried rice! And if they ""ARE"" for $5 you should be looking at them like O_o because any mediocre lobster at a minimum DOES NOT cost $5. Try it but make sure to have at least $100 for YOURSELF alone on hand."
Jennie S.,/user_details?userid=byKHII0_wVSv_hGxA092wg,"Honolulu, HI",12/10/2014,5,"Tried this place out while in town with a few friends. Really cool decor and the food was awesome! I'm all about places that encourage ordering several dishes and sharing with the table. Everything we had was delicious. The cocktails were good and service was pretty great too. My favorite thing was either the edamame dumpling things,  or the calamari salad. The lava cake and bread pudding dish was also a winner in my book."

The space is massive with gorgeous high ceilings. I went a while back, so don't remember exactly what I ordered (besides the delish crispy popcorn shrimp) but I was impressed with the meal and found it to be reasonably priced for a Chelsea hot spot. Guys, this is a foolproof place to take a date."

I wish I can turn this night back around and NEVER chose it as my venue. Thank you for making this the worst birthday, ever."

Chris W.,/user_details?userid=ybI9EyaFFcZ4ofEOGjP3aQ,"Seattle, WA",3/9/2015,5,"Top notch food, service, and ambiance. I would probably eat dinner in the bar next time as I appreciated the dim lighting and the downtempo house music. No complaints about the dining room, though. The several appetizers we had were all delicious. I had the Glazed Black Cod for dinner - perfectly cooked. I have to say the dessert was the highlight for me: the Crying Chocolate and the Almond Bread Pudding. I'm fantasizing about both desserts now."
Jimmy C.,/user_details?userid=vSipgNEXvTGgKjHGFDEfDw,"Bensonhurst, NY",1/25/2015,5,Don't bother booking a table because the ambiance  in the bar is much more personal. I always walk in and prey upon a table instead of making a reservation. Their appetizers are super bomb especially those spicy dumplings. Staff is always super nice and did I say this was featured in sex and the city?
Michelle H.,/user_details?userid=4iWyTdOZ7ToOmlCM3gZfqQ,"Rochester, NY",11/18/2017,5,"Love it here, dumplings are great, had cauliflower lollipops (amazing), huge space with variety of themed rooms make it seem like a different venue each time."

Ness M.,/user_details?userid=yACfqGWGD49e8Duu-ZIQJA,"New York, NY",1/13/2015,4,"The ambiance is very nice, dim light/very dark. The food was good, we came here to celebrate a friend 30th b-day. We had the rock shrimp, which was luke warm with an average taste, Basically fried batter shrimp with an mild spicy red creamy sauce. I was yet to taste Rock shrimp that is to die for. We also had the calamari salad which was pretty tasty, so  tasty that we ordered a second round. The lobster fried rice was OK and so was the cod fish. The drinks were very delicious. Our waitress was nice, accommodating and very informative and informed us of what she taught tasted good and what was mediocre. I read all of the negative comment but honestly is place bet a lot of other places, therefor it gets 4stars from me."

Angelica C.,/user_details?userid=6iY04K1DmWSpu4UAjpPfoQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/8/2015,5,"sultry and chic without being overly priced, obnoxious or pretentious. Amazing service from the moment we walk in,the lovely hostess (gorgeous African-American girl!) promptly take us to our table, noticing how big and tall my husband was (6'5 220lbs) she proceed to make sure we were comfortably seated (something extremely rare to find in NYC restaurants where they stuff everyone into the corner table for four people and they seat ten! Carolina was our perfect server, pointing out favorites and vegetarian choices. Food was impeccable and portion sizes were delicious (specially the Pistachio chocolate cremoso!) drink were good but they could always improve a little bit...THANK YOU!"
Kerry L.,/user_details?userid=Nq5rE--nVlqmhPWxrfVbEw,"Philadelphia, PA",1/4/2015,3,"Good place to go for a fun night out, the decor is impressive and fun to bring out of town guests...very impressive.  The food is good, I've been there for dinners and also for apps and drinks.  I would recommend getting a bunch of apps and splitting them, plus cocktails--some are simply fab.  Overall, fun place, good food, tasty drinks."
Ruben P.,/user_details?userid=4bXy-EPKDoyuGutnohrcmw,"Bronx, NY",4/7/2015,5,"Beautiful place, beautiful people, Host and waitress were very attentive.  I had the Duck fried rice, Dungeness fried rice, Tuna Tartare spring rolls, Pork buns which were all delicious."
Rebecca K.,/user_details?userid=C0IZb7wKsIbRv7XDG6ZAVA,"Toronto, Canada",8/29/2014,5,"Still one of the best dinners in NYC! Ambience is great, service excellent and the food is beyond words. Chili rock shrimp, edamame dumplings, Peking duck wraps, lobster egg rolls, tuna tartare cones ... All solid choices. You won't be disappointed!"

For main entrees I highly recommend the black cod and Peking duck--both 10/10."
Christopher C.,/user_details?userid=J4bQSDIxYeP2RZLp3a_arA,"Reston, VA",4/2/2015,4,"Excellent food and service. We sat in the far back room and they were able to seat us including our extra person. We were a little late to our reservation so we ended up drinking in the bar for 30 minutes. A hostess was able to locate us in the crowded bar and bring us to our table. The inside of the restaurant is spectacular especially at night. The food was good and the wine and champagne prices were reasonable. I especially liked the pork fat, dumplings, and tuna tar tar."
Katherine G.,/user_details?userid=jzfWgBoKDT1v0MzyW7XZhQ,"Little Ferry, NJ",2/8/2015,5,"What an experience! From the beautiful ambience to the great service that we got from Jack! The food was excellent and the true highlight was the duck. Not a huge duck fan but upon review after review, I had to try and so glad I did. It was worth every penny! Save room for dessert because the Almond bread pudding ended the night perfectly!  Kudos!"

Nurys I.,/user_details?userid=uDIC7SRFnjyVI3nYeBAAYg,"Key Biscayne, FL",3/4/2014,3,"Had high expectations that weren't met...  The cocktails we ordered were not good at all.  The short rib pancakes were delicious and the miso cod very tasty, otherwise the Lobster fried rice was served cold and lacked in flavor and the sampler appetizer was just ok.  I much prefer Tao.  The service was excellent however, and the restaurant is beautiful."
Majid J.,/user_details?userid=MpywrKYaAX51jIC4SSLqLQ,"Chandler, AZ",11/14/2014,5,Awesome place.  Great food and service.  Perfect Manhattan spot.
Hope W.,/user_details?userid=QOB6nT0zAGjuhIqS8hBZqw,"Hoboken, NJ",11/12/2014,5,"Talk about ambience. You never know what is going on in the shadows. Tables are situated so close but seem so far away. This place is perfect for a make-up make-out session (we are obviously not sitting at the communal table). Although the portions are small, they do it right by curbing your appetite thus making every bite and every moment a sexy and savory memory."
Melissa L.,/user_details?userid=r7lhimgOhW5NGsdtoU56wA,"New Orleans, LA",8/6/2018,1,"too expensive. too loud. not great food or service. Go here if you want to take an Instagram pic, go anywhere else if you enjoy food."
Anita G.,/user_details?userid=VUzICKsFPed4uZjXry2O7g,"Miami Beach, FL",10/20/2014,5,This place is a waaaay better version of HAKKASAN (Miami) in NYC. Service was amazing and the place is beautiful! I'm not a big fan of dumplings but the raw fish I had there is amazing! I can't wait to go there again and recommend to anyone! Can't go wrong with this one! :)

A G.,/user_details?userid=T_NLjJW-8bR0SyxTjC5Ocw,"Jersey City, NJ",3/13/2015,5,"A little pricey if you're on a tight budget, but definitely worth it if you been saving up for a nice night out! The atmosphere is so cool; dim lighting, high ceilings, modern architecture. I took my husband here for his birthday (asian food is his favorite) and he can't stop talking about it to this day. The Pork Potstickers and General Tso's Dumplings (my mouth is watering already...take me back!) were to die for!"

He got us the best ever selection of food and wine. Had an amazing experience. Everything was outstanding. Really appreciate Kevin and the chefs. Great service and excellent food!!
Ankur D.,/user_details?userid=H1_DxJIpa92UrKiJHq5GIg,"Manhattan, NY",7/16/2016,3,"Service was horrendous.  If it weren't for the ambiance or food, rating would be much lower.  The waitress was so condescending to my mom, who was wondering where her vegetarian meal was (the only one that came after we almost finished our dinner).  We were celebrating my mom's birthday so it was upsetting to see the waitress take such a condescending tone to my parents.  Further, they took almost 30 minutes to seat us.  We didn't mind the wait, it was their attitude that upset us.  They were so disorganized at the door; shocking for a high end restaurant.  Buddakan is supposed to be great; we have been to the Philly location multiple times.  I'm sure even Stephen Starr would be seriously disappointed in the service we witnessed.  In the end, the manager apologized, which helped, and the food was good.  Hoping to see improved service or hopefully even 5-star service the next time we come, if we do come again."
La H.,/user_details?userid=tHq-VQF6j4FelfD80w4CdA,"Manhattan, NY",7/8/2016,4,"Came here in December with a group of 5 people and ordered from their group tasting menu. We also ordered cocktails then ended up ordering a bottle of wine. The bill was $650 before gratuity. A little pricey but if it's your first time here it is worth being able to taste a bunch of different appetizers, entrees, and desserts. The best part of the meal for me was the delicious short ribs and pistachio ice cream but I expected some of the other dishes to taste better. The service from our waiter was good and the ambiance of the restaurant is wonderful."
Elena D.,/user_details?userid=bCuU38TN9sbM1aPR78aeng,"New York, NY",6/8/2014,5,"The interior is reminiscent of the initial scenes of Inception, perfect mixture of lounge and restaurant. It's loud, so don't plan on catching up with people you haven't talked to in a while here. GET THE EDAMAME DUMPLINGS! They are fantastic, it feels like a pâté and it's this fancy schmansy serving plating with only 5 dumplings, so if your splitting it, go ahead and take the last dumpling for yourself. Everything was ridiculously good. The waiters were entertaining and very knowledgable too. Overall faaaaantastic I can't wait to go back."
Richard R.,/user_details?userid=ga25XeZSk7Hpqj9SuSomwA,"Bronx, NY",5/6/2015,5,"The ambiance was great and the service was friendly, it was crowded per the usual but what else would you expect at a place like this! I would highly recommend and I plan on coming back as soon as possible!"
Jamie B. F.,/user_details?userid=xwIlKrteHLXdgDOvdDdC-g,"Yonkers, NY",1/12/2015,3,"Great quality, but extremely over priced for the serving size. If you know what to order, you can get the same thing at authentic Chinese restaurants downtown for like 1/4 of the price.... jus' sayin."
Esther M.,/user_details?userid=Y4128zR_Y5sYH-FTweibbw,"Manhattan, NY",3/1/2015,3,"Don't expect authentic Chinese food when you visit Buddakan, this is as american chinese as you can get, not that I am not a fan.  Its still a fantastic space with a beautiful dining room and table ( circa sex in the city the movie, carrie's rehearsal dinner) with great drinks.  The food is good, but not cheap."

Aida L.,/user_details?userid=oiHfLj41w8xpAQTdrNaTEw,"Manhattan, NY",2/25/2015,4,Love the ambiance and food is pretty decent. Great for first dates and birthday parties.
Barry B.,/user_details?userid=dcDE5OsV_1DztUkEHFOe_A,"Carthage, MO",2/22/2017,3,"The place is amazing to look at, but they like to play games.  a reservation for a table in the main dining room was made weeks in advance, but no table was available on arrival.  We walked around with a ?maitre d'  looking for a suitable table.  There were plenty of empties, but they like to play games.  Also they said on the phone there were plenty of gluten free options, but there weren't.  Most everything had soy sauce with wheat.  Very disappointing.  But we made the best of it.  The food was good but wildly overpriced for the small portions that arrived. Shared a bottle of apple cider with my son, it was the worst I had.  Avoid.  Go for the experience, but beware!!!"
Lauren C.,/user_details?userid=zEfN-WE-DbqbZMH7NmFfBg,"New York, NY",1/2/2015,3,The food is decent Americanized Asian I'm not sure I would call it fusion - it's really nothing revolutionary for the price. The decor and the drinks are the highlight of this place. The large table downstairs reminds me of Hogwarts!
Naquita K.,/user_details?userid=KhmSOqKgT6jMeseXUeLxfg,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",2/22/2015,5,Although I'm normally not a fan of Thai.

Samantha S.,/user_details?userid=my1VebRHMyv9hAu2ytHUwQ,"Paramus, NJ",2/16/2015,4,"The food is very good and worth the price. However, the waiters try and trick you into ordering way more than you need to if they see that it is your first time there by telling you that the restaurant is ""family style."" Other than that this restaurant has a really fun and trendy vibe and there is plenty of seating and space."
Yoda Y.,/user_details?userid=pyFqXFdPbW2xGTi8kme9Fw,"Chicago, IL",4/17/2015,1,Entered with group of girls and one fell on the staircase due to spillage that was not cleaned by staff. The host quickly remarked that she shouldn't be embarrassed or worry because no one saw rather than ensuring she was ok. Manager then gave her a napkin with ice in it too help the bruising and no one checked on her or acknowledged the incident throughout and after the meal. Enter at your own risk! Careless and inconsiderate staff.
Latoya E.,/user_details?userid=rW6DJxvIkL_FH-aXiWHDYQ,"Union Township, NJ",2/13/2017,2,"Don't believe the hype. Our table ordered the duck fried rice, chicken congee, and eggplant tofu, and no one was impressed. The desserts were poor, too. We ordered the Crying Chocolate b/c everyone raves about it, but it was so hyped up for no reason. Also had the banana pudding, which was totally forgettable, and the apple fritter that was the sorriest excuse for a dessert that I've ever seen. No filling. No sweetness. No flavor. The apples were sliced on top, like an afterthought. How is this place still in business and jam-packed? I'll never know. We will not be back."

I loved the tuna spring roll appetizers, seriously order these they are little bites of heaven. I also enjoyed the pork buns, general tso's dumplings and the lobster friend rice. I would have to say the lobster fried rice was a little bit underwhelming. While it had chunks of lobster it tasted a bit plain and under seasoned. The service and decor was awesome. The small plates and the chocolate lava dessert were definitely the stand out."
Catherine S.,/user_details?userid=CTVxC215KRMY-oKgDmxZcw,"Studio City, CA",4/3/2017,2,"This place was OK. My fiance and I dined here in January while vacationing. The server and atmosphere was outstanding. However, I cannot write this review without mentioning the fact that we both got food poisoning the very next morning after dining here. Our last day in NYC was completely ruined and we spent all day in bed taking turns in the bathroom throwing up. Its unfortunate, but it happens. My fiance is also in the business so we understand that such things can happen, but it did truly ruin our last day. Because of this I cannot vouch for the food, and will probably be terrified to come back here again. Drinks, decor, servers, and atmosphere was outstanding."

The waiter informed us they all came with different number of pieces but said he would make sure the kitchen would offer 5 pieces so everyone could taste one of everything. The food was amazing and the staff was so friendly. The decor was amazing in itself. Cant wait to go back.
Smitha G.,/user_details?userid=uYwP6taJhxGxPPuqDLHrvQ,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",3/29/2015,5,One of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Sexy environment and perfect for a date night or a girl's night out.  The sampling menu is the way to go if you are hungry and want to try some great dishes.
Andrew F.,/user_details?userid=hkVlTZqo4nFHn9MoH8nwPQ,"New York, NY",1/26/2015,3,Food is solid.  Service is lack-luster at best and ambiance is dated.  Nuff said.  Seacrest out!
Thuy T.,/user_details?userid=4qj9O6OHL8AAaTL3jDswhg,"Houston, TX",8/18/2017,2,"The restaurant is very nice inside with a lot of staff but the service wasn't that great.  No one came over to refill our drinks or to see if everything was good.  I had the egg rolls and the sticky crab rice.  The sticky crab rice was pretty good, the flavor was all there.  The egg roll was bitter, jack and the box egg roll taste way better.  The only dessert that was good was the flan, one of the best flan I had."
Karlee A.,/user_details?userid=Umm7WuI-9h7dgjL-ROEyOw,"New York, NY",3/26/2017,3,"I have been to Buddakan probably 20+ times. I think it's safe to say it's one of my all time favorite restaurants. However, last time I went was VERY disappointing. In the past they have made special occasions all the more special with excellent customer service, and even free champagne or appetizers, combined with amazing food and ambiance. This last time however, on the night of my engagement, we were greeted with TERRIBLE customer service, both at check in and by our waitress. The lobster fried rice was bland and mediocre. I had high hopes for Buddakan to deliver on such a special occasion, something my fiancé had informed them of. Unfortunately, they did not treat us in the same wonderful ways they have in the past. Maybe it was a fluke, but a bad night to be one!"

We started off with cocktails - get anything off the cocktail list and you will be golden! Then we ordered edamame dumplings, which hit the spot. Seriously, they melt in your mouth and you can't stop. For the main meal, I got the wild mushroom chow fun with garlic. It was the perfect balance of spicy, salty goodness. I think the main courses are something you can get anywhere, but the dumplings and cocktails are unique. Plus, you can't beat the atmosphere. With dim lighting and beautiful chandeliers in the main room are something to definitely take in and enjoy. I would recommend it for a fun night out and some tasty dishes. You can't go wrong!"

Vincent T.,/user_details?userid=G6mNnY-vJCyA3gAH5b34Ew,"Glen Head, NY",3/3/2015,4,I been to Buddakan here a couple of times now and can say that the food here is of the quality you would expect for the price you pay. I did have a couple complaints as food is sent as it is ready but we got our main dishes at least 20 minutes before the rice and veg accompaniments arrived.  It seemed strange that the main dish came out before anyone of the items we wanted as appetizers and side dishes. Service and food were great and cocktails amazing.
Tanya G.,/user_details?userid=uF6iuoGUTXRFCeaWdPjTtw,"Edgewater, NJ",12/31/2014,3,"Disappointing this time around! I came here years ago and decided to come back now with some relatives visiting from California and I must say was underwhelmed this time. For the price, I did not think the food was all that great. The waiter kept pushing us to try the tasting menu and maybe if we did we would get to try more variety. Their signature cocktail were really pretty bad, we had to send back several of them. Don't think I will be coming back here too often"

Overblown, overrated, overdone. Food was middling at best; mostly cold; tasteless with a styrofoam texture and that generic trans fat like oil slick on every plate. Trying to capture a Vegas club like feel, the place is a tourist trap with far hipper, far better and far healthier looking and tasting Asian and Asian fusion food all over NYC and its environs. Save for your kid's bar mitzvah. Pass on it for everything else."

Leo O.,/user_details?userid=JDobQXqU_EQciRJu4hpUAw,"Beverly Hills, CA",12/28/2014,5,"More authentic Chinese than fusion.

Once you've checked in for your reservation, they give you a nice bit of time to actually enjoy the bar and lounge area, which has a great vibe, good music, nice cocktails and interesting people. Then, about as long as it takes to get through a cocktail (perfect timing), you descend to the dining rooms. Yes, some here get sticker shock, but it you appreciate good service and even better food, you won't bat an eye. Can't wait to get back up to the city and give it another go."

The seating area was completely monopolized by a Sweet 16 dinner (not entirely the restaurants fault, but I had I known, we would have made reservations for a different night). The birthday girl's father made about 10 loud toasts and the party-goers were never asked to confine their festivities to their table. It was LOUD - not like out to dinner loud - like high school cafeteria loud. Something about a $20 glass of wine and screechy teenage chatter just doesn't mix for me."

The ambiance of the space was quite nice although I must say the lighting was a bit too dark for my taste. The restaurant is a play on Asian fusion, offering a handful of menu options at varied prices. The food was not so great. I ordered the Dim Sum (Edamame Dumplings) and Pork Pot Stickers. By the time the food was brought to us it was cold. On the contrary the drinks were great; I ordered a Tranquility (Absolut Citroen vodka with lemongrass-infused oolong tea). Due to the fact the restaurant is in the Chelsea Market one would think Buddakan would be a more esteemed establishment. While a very nice restaurant there are a few areas that need some polishing."

Felice S.,/user_details?userid=iiEfXgcwLZe0KMTyEpMBzA,"Brooklyn, NY",1/14/2015,4,The Atlantic City Venue is beautiful. It was crowded and I expected it to be noisy but there was a wonderful feeling of warmth in the room. The dishes were well prepared and the service was great.
Jeremy F.,/user_details?userid=5oM6YN3CQwiN8TkWiOfzzA,"Jersey City, NJ",3/21/2015,5,My wife and I went here for our anniversary. Very fancy place. The service was very friendly and knowledgeable. Lobster Fried Rice was incredible!
Stacey N.,/user_details?userid=vcf8c3_-5F60-jVVkOGXnA,"Brooklyn, NY",1/12/2015,5,The food is here is to die for!!! My waiter was a little curt to say the least but the food was just that yummy that this restaurant still earns 5 stars.
Jolie S.,/user_details?userid=F48nXlUS2RTQf8bN2Q3gCg,"Woodcliff Lake, NJ",6/3/2017,5,"Consistently delicious and always a great time! Brandon, the general manager, is awesome! He was an absolute pleasure to work with when we celebrated my friend's 40th birthday dinner there. It is people like him that make people come back."

A little on the pricy side but you get what you pay for. I feel so chic when I sit down for dinner and cocktails with the girls! WIll definitely be back!
Tammy V.,/user_details?userid=QOHnmmTZKiXFXDUY_5fYpA,"Pelham, NY",11/8/2014,4,"Went here last Friday at midnight (Halloween) to a friends birthday dinner. We got seated at a corner table, 1/2 Booth across from the SATC communal table.  Service was good, i must say our waitress was very patient with 5 indecisive chatty girls. Cocktails i had the 'Elevation' and trust I was elevated( had to do it :) ) This drink was really good it had a nice taste of ginger and spices *yum* I ordered another which I ended up sharing with everyone at the table because they wanted to know why I was so Happy, they too got it...Onto the food I had the Calamari Salad that was good, the lobster fried rice had 1 bite and bagged it. Dessert was the Screaming Chocolate,  had some type of coffee on the side it was ok. My friend had the lamb chops which she loved, someone else had lobster tail she was raving about it. To conclude our bill was $433.00 not bad for 5girls. I will be back for my now fave drink Elevation. We had a great time!"

The service was outstanding and the food was to die for. Everything we had was great. My bf and I shared a total of 4 dim sum plates and a fried rice which was plenty of food. We had the general Tsos dumplings, boneless spare rib, rock shrimp, lobster egg rolls, and crab sticky rice. In one word INCREDIBLE! We would definitely go back there as the hype surrounding this place was totally valid. The best thing we had were the dumplings. You can't go wrong with those!"
Danielle C.,/user_details?userid=jGKGbjajU26YC0GfsSWXnQ,"New York, NY",3/12/2015,4,"Amazing edamame dumplings, great atmosphere, good food and interesting cocktails."
Kurt S.,/user_details?userid=LBJTMihXIem-0rd4-neuLA,"New York, NY",1/4/2015,4,As always Buddakan delivered.  I cannot say anything was over the top awesome or horrible.  Just a great meal with excellent atmosphere - typical of this establishment...
David F.,/user_details?userid=AxzS1uO0YBCn7c9nIrqVZA,"Olney, MD",1/3/2015,3,"The food was good. Our favorite dishes were the General Tso's Dumplings and the Black Pepper Beef. We ended the night with a crying chocolate for dessert and it was delicious. The environment is trendy and fun. My only complaints are that the portions are very small for the price you are paying. You also need to make a reservation way in advance. Making a reservation a little less than a week beforehand, we were offered a 5 or 10:30 seating."

Dress up nicely to go in this area... The service is good. But I'm nt crazy about their food.. I'm a chick that loveeessss to eat and the serving is enough to reach halfway my esophagus. Me and my boyfriend hit up other restaurants to eat more food. Don't come here hungry."

We stuffed ourselves and didn't regret a bite (even though we'd already had snacks at Chelsea Market next door). The chow fun noodles and the glazed fish dish are the ones I think about most and wish I could order again.

We had 2 appetizers and then split the Miso Black Cod  and snap peas. The fish was better than the appetizers. I would give the food 3 stars and the decor/atmosphere 5 stars."
Janelle R.,/user_details?userid=t-GG0dWO1LXAFUudbL5tDw,"Staten Island, NY",12/29/2014,3,The decor and the ambience is very trendy. It's a nice place to go to on a date. The dim lighting gives the restaurant a romantic feel. The food was very good  but I wasn't crazy about the drinks. I would't go back.
Samantha B.,/user_details?userid=FGv1fGMQ0DY6fMJkwBG62A,"New York, NY",12/28/2016,5,Finally a place with portions that was classy and provides large portions! Great for group outings as long as the group has no problem with spending a little for a delightful experience. The waiter was super energetic and with a party of 9 you can imagine the kind of attention you would need!! The lamb chops are my fave! I have been to the location in Philadelphia as well. I will say I will definitely recommend Buddakan if anyone asks for a recommendation. No matter the location the service & the food was amazing!
Joselyn G.,/user_details?userid=FcZlmjtE_TqOWVTyNjWmQA,"New York, NY",12/29/2014,5,"Came here to celebrate my bday with a couple of friends and even tho we made a reservation we waited about 5 extra mins which was understandable due to the fact we had some special requests. Aside from this everything was amazing! The food was specially great, highly recommend the edamame dumplings and the calamari salad which were by far my favorite. The decor makes for a romantic evening, even the bathroom was beautiful"
Amber M.,/user_details?userid=TZtP6l8rPN6y4GlfiZAKZw,"Manhattan, NY",12/29/2014,4,Always a win. The cod though is hit or miss. Great for shares.
Suz B.,/user_details?userid=Ou0K1lOgdI4dGG4_mQe8RA,"Manhattan, NY",12/29/2014,4,"Sexy, date spot.  But too long a wait even with a res.  Might be best for large parties early in the night."
Yihao O.,/user_details?userid=xt9H5e7_Re-QPW-N_ED7kQ,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",3/4/2017,4,"This place is Asian fusion in both its setting and food styles. I'd give 5 for ambient, 3.8 for food and 4 for service. It's one of the best among the few contemporary high end Chinese we tried recently.  Although I thought their Peking duck was definitely not prepared by Chinese chef because he left us with very little crispy skin but a lot of thick meat. Likewise the fried chicken congee was interesting in concept and well executed on the congee part but the meat was too white. We both liked their foie gras dumplings but agreed we didn't taste any duck or goose liver. The pork belly bums were also popular. I loved my desert of chocolate pudding and green tea ice cream mixed with a lot crunchy stuff"
Samantha H.,/user_details?userid=e05-ueh3RykOJnPXPQjFGA,"New York, NY",3/4/2017,5,"You almost miss the bleek black door in the red brick diagonal to noticeable TAO. You enter into lounge with chic music and high ceilings then into a restaurant made up of many rooms which flow effortlessly into each other. Everything is grand scale. And the food is absolutely amazing. We order crab and lobster rolls, edamame dumplings, Cantonese wantons, filet, crispy shrimp, broken chicken, lobster fried rice, pork noodles and charred broccoli. Every single bite was delightful. The alcohol is quite weak and cocktails very fruity but still delicious. Our waiter was actually courteous and helpful - hard to come by in this city."
J L.,/user_details?userid=00aM45_c08-1-kxaoGe4GQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/5/2015,4,BOOM... AWESOME SPOT. Food is great. Had a wonderful time for a friends Birthday Party.  Everything was delicious

Emilie J.,/user_details?userid=Ix0UofK2328iGTo5cOp8vQ,"ROSEDALE, NY",3/29/2016,5,"I came here for my birthday dinner and i was definitely not disappointed! First off this place is BEAUTIFULLL, especially if you get to dine downstairs (the wait was pretty long for that luxury though). The waitress was everything i love in service, attentive and filled with suggestions. She literally picked my whole meal. I started with the general tsos dumplings which were soo good! My friend had the little pork sandwiches  (cant remember the name) and he loved them. For the entrees we split the shrimp and lobster pasta  (don't remember that name either sorry) and the monkfish. The noodles were really good and filling so we didn't need a side dish and the monkfish was AMAZINGGG. I was so happy thr waitress recommended it because that was nowhere near what i was going to order. To top it off everyone i encountered from the person checking in to the seater to the manager to the waitress ALL acknowledged my birthday I felt special.Thank you buddakan for making my birthday special!!"
Andreas R.,/user_details?userid=UIFjLoB4zcNuIfI0ihnxkg,"New York, NY",3/3/2015,4,Sexy and impressive interior.  Get transported in this Asian inspired restaurant that has many different dining areas.  Dine family style and really delve into the entire experience.  Waits are expected for up to half an hour to get your table.  Weekends expect more.  This is where they increase your bar tab as you wait...
George N.,/user_details?userid=y0P02DOVcbFzi_NHxy1qqw,"PECK SLIP, NY",7/21/2016,5,"Just flawless from beginning to end. We went to celebrate a 21st birthday. We were seated in the great room and went for the top of the line set menu. All dishes were amazing. So much food, all delivered with an incredible level of professionalism. A truly memorable and remarkable night. Love this place."
Amarar S.,/user_details?userid=aKUBeH9OUZ7bsGaJoQq66w,"San Francisco, CA",8/31/2014,5,Wow! I had mediocre expectations due to the hype. Went here with a very large party for dinner and everything was flawless. Did the tasting menu and it was absolutely delicious. Such wonderful flavors and textures and prepared perfectly. The cocktails were generous and the service never faltered. I was very happy to be wrong.
Lana K.,/user_details?userid=7ZKfLEin-cGgOA6o8l0t5A,"New Orleans, LA",12/22/2014,5,"Sexy hip restaurant in Chelsea area. Started with the boneless ribs - quickly served and melt in your mouth good.  Helpful waiter suggested 2 veggies, stir fry broccoli with ginger and steamed mixed greens - ironically felt healthy while eating these and then to the peking duck OMG - my husband chewed with his eyes closed and a smile across his face - Ethereal !!!"
Jessica M.,/user_details?userid=4NgDuzsJRIrhPYnuGhUP7g,"Hamden, CT",12/20/2014,1,"Over priced, below average food...I would not go back. The food came out warm and tasted like they pre-cooked the food and tossed in the microwave before serving"
Patrick W.,/user_details?userid=YWK9uH241COcz5cch_SVHg,"New York, NY",2/22/2015,2,Tourist central. Great concept and wonderful food. Sadly they treat you like cattle and charge you like a rock star. There is always someone that they are more interested in than you. Dress well and go somewhere else.
Tim W.,/user_details?userid=e1W3EGY6KfNB_rtTeeZiYQ,"Doylestown, PA",12/16/2014,5,"I've eaten at Buddakan in Philadelphia since it opened in the early 90s.  I've also eaten at the Atlantic City outpost several times.  I pretty much expected more of the same when I ate at the NYC location.  My feelings were initially confirmed when I entered and sat at the first bar in the immediate entryway.  That quickly changed after we were led into and seated in the dining room.  To say I was absolutely blown away by the decor and layout is a massive understatement.   It goes beyond words how beautiful this place is. Ultra-cool.  And the food is of the highest quality, better than the original in Philly.  Stephen Starr has outdone himself."
Big B.,/user_details?userid=hPogqdiJwgs51701QPhzqA,"New York, NY",8/23/2016,4,I would give 3.5 stars but round up to 4 stars. This place is very good for dating as you can not see each with such a dim light. The food is ok but it seems that the restaurant premade the food and then heat it to cater such a large volume of customers.

Sabra N.,/user_details?userid=USg3JJWpnX490nhHn-1Qhw,"New York, NY",7/13/2014,3,"Not impressed! I have been trying to go to this place for a long time. The venue is amazingly beautiful, and the staff very friendly and attentive but the food??? I wasn't impressed, the cold noodles with peanut sauce and lime ice cream and the crab sticky rice highly recommended by the waitress were good but not amazing at all. Not sure what I missed here...

Alicia G.,/user_details?userid=htdL2X2a2u19CPepWL0Djg,"Seattle, WA",5/2/2017,4,"The food was absolutely amazing.  We had a selection of the dim sum and then the beef dish and whole fish for main course. Some of the best food I've ever eaten! The restaurant décor and ambience is just gorgeous also. We had a really great night! Just on the slightly negative side our waitress whilst really lovely & friendly, could have been more attentive. And on the really negative side the bathrooms were quite disgusting. There are 2 uni-sex stalls for the whole floor upstairs and I can honestly say I've experienced better facilities at music festivals."

Amy D.,/user_details?userid=BXOKds2IM-zmCKcUxPaJAw,"Bergen County, NJ",12/4/2014,2,"I went here with my boyfriend.  I guess it's kind of romantic, since it's really dark downstairs, which helps when you don't want to see somebody's face.  Ordered edamame filled dumplings as an appetizer.  They were amazing.  Also I really enjoyed their special cocktails.  However, I was overall disappointed with my entrees, which I felt were greasy and kind of similar to typical Asian takeout restaurants, not a higher class dining establishment.  I'm not really interested in going back."

Stella F.,/user_details?userid=lx8BSbCQWVnBz0gWpEV1bg,"Providence, RI",8/5/2014,4,"I dined at Buddkan this weekend and had a great dinner and experience!  My boyfriend and I visited from out of town and loved the atmosphere, food and drink offerings. Our initial reservation was at 11pm, but we wanted to dine earlier. We showed up around 9:30, and were told that they were running on time. Because of that, we decided to wait for a table in the lounge area while we got a drink. Luckily, a table opened up with 10 mins and we sat down! The waitress was very attentive and friendly. All of the food was delicious, especially the rock shrimp and the Chinese sausage chili rice. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"
Lisa S.,/user_details?userid=aVPwBrCgsRlg-NwCBaDzeg,"Pompano Beach, FL",4/19/2015,5,"Great everything!!! Service, food ambiance.... I highly recommend this place. If you love oxtail you are going to love the dim sum. Then we move on to the filet and lamb chops.... Tender Tender Tender.... I love rice and the rice was made perfectly. The cauliflower had a nice kick.... If you are vegan this veggie is not for you, it has some ground pork in it. The flavors are so yummy you have to try for yourself. This place is great for a date, a group of friends it doesn't matter... Your hunger will thank you."

All our food was wonderful as I'm sure all the food is there (I got the beef and the sauce it came with i could have drank it was so good) but make sure you don't skip desert! The almond bread pudding was TO DIE FOR. Bananas, butterscotch sauce, whiskey ice cream my mouth is watering thinking about it."
Gregory B.,/user_details?userid=SwoSd0PPY0TclYYHzgO3hg,"Brooklyn, NY",11/22/2014,4,Had an amazing time and the food was awesome. A perfect date night. Make sure you have reservations
Lyndsey K.,/user_details?userid=tlp3eLt5xqH9I95KGJmVAA,"Cedarhurst, NY",1/28/2015,4,I have been to Buddakan three times and each time was great!  The first time was with three other people and we were able to share a few different dishes.  The other two times I went with only one other person.  The food was just as great but we were not able to try as many options.  My friend and I loved the General Tso's Dumplings so much we almost ordered another plate.  The décor is very pretty.  A great place for a date.  I liked it better than Tao because I felt that it was more gourmet.  It was a pricey meal but definitely worth it!
Susan L.,/user_details?userid=acbrcLZJ9IvdbfrxJj1_zg,"Morristown, NJ",1/27/2015,4,"Went for early Saturday evening dinner before show.  A fun, high energy place.  Good service, yummy drinks and nice menu.  Food had nice presentation served with a relaxed pace."
Bing Bing D.,/user_details?userid=Si2ZTHrkU8bosItKVfSHLA,"Melbourne, Australia",4/12/2015,1,"All too salty, from the entrees to mains they were all extremely salty, I think the chef is not really studied Asian cuisine... And thinking tasty is just adding more salt... This is a lazy way to cheat... The restaurant should get their inspiration from the real Asian food, not the American Asian food."

He was extremely well versed in the appliances we were interested in. We purchased a complete kitchen set of appliances. We were given complete attention and spent 3.5 hours making our decision. He answered all of our questions in very professional manner!. We never felt any pressure. We would, recommend this to everyone!...  Ken Burdick, Red Bank. NJ."
Saba S.,/user_details?userid=SzXrDQ5setNAhI8H_DY43w,"Manhattan, NY",7/20/2014,4,"Best experience ever. I love french food but i was at first hesitant about coming for the food cause pan french asian i always think its like tex mex version of french and asian food and didnt think it was going to be good. It actually was, I loved the bar food of the pot stickers, we headed back down to the long table in the main dining area and it was beautiful especially with the romantic opera candles. The Drinks were amazing and i HAVE TO GOO BACK. Also try to get the froie gras and the thousand year old egg"

Decor is great the the ambience is fitting. The food, however, seems to be just your average Chinese food with expensive ingredients you can not taste. There is prolly a good reason you don't put lobster in fried rice..."
Christine M.,/user_details?userid=5DkSnPuAhyaAER4uWMQMLg,"West Palm Beach, FL",3/26/2015,5,"This restaurant deserves the time out of my busy day to rate it.  By far , its one of my favorites and I tend to gravitate here for celebrations and holidays when I am in NY.  The appetizers are just as stimulating as the entrees and the deserts - well even if you normally don't partake- they are a must! I highly recommend reservations and this is a dress to impress establishment."
Mary S.,/user_details?userid=cI9vW8ymkHd6mQlknWxo7g,"Nutley, NJ",3/26/2015,5,"Fantastic ambiance and this place is appropriate for dates, a night out with the girls, or a dinner with business associates. I've been to Buddakan about 3 or 4 times, and each time ordered an array of different menu items to share with my party. Every time, the service was professional, the food and drinks were very good, and overall it is always an enjoyable dining experience."

Carolina C.,/user_details?userid=Gu-0_bGBGdQFBcSsdQxsqg,"Miami, FL",10/26/2014,5,"Went there for dinner with my husband. Loved the vibe of this restaurant! Dark, good music, awesome food!! If you're in NYC, make sure you check it out! It's in the Meatpacking district, which is an area I love as well!!"
Sean L.,/user_details?userid=s--ymjnuoMyNqlUAphSl0w,"Holmdel, NJ",12/31/2014,4,Buddakan is a great experience all around.   The food portions are very small and the prices are high but the overall ambiance of the place along with the quality of the food are both very high.  A great example of modern Asian Fusion.   It's tough to go wrong with anything on the menu... just don't expect to leave full.
Craig G.,/user_details?userid=YREitg0wuFwc2OlqHzXUHg,"Oak Brook, IL",10/23/2016,5,Extremely elegant Asian-Parisian cocktail lounge and restaurant - incredibly good diverse menu.  Top shelf drinks and dining.  Quite a scene - hipster and well heeled beautiful clientele.

Vincent E.,/user_details?userid=MTBTyqiaW6sEOrLU-dSO_w,Hong Kong,12/28/2014,4,Number one ambiance! Good food! Excellent service! Try the Raw tuna rolls. If you want to have a great time with friends this place is beautiful.

Maureen B.,/user_details?userid=nZ8wv7xFAoC3BqB8y-toOg,"Great Kills, Staten Island, NY",6/29/2014,5,Buddakan is one my favorite spots in NYC. The food is always impeccable!  The atmosphere is chic and sexy. I recommend trying one of the tasting menus as your able to experience many of the different dishes that are some of the best on the menu.  At least try the rock shrimp and the black cod - it melts in your mouth!   Def a cool experience to eat at the great table!  Also try the fate cocktail- unique and tasty!

Christopher A.,/user_details?userid=pkeGV3JnOBJUsWBNNAMr8Q,"Hoboken, NJ",3/7/2017,5,One of my favorite places to get dinner. I like the decor and the food is amazing.

Wesley S.,/user_details?userid=Vj6waVhIVS-G1LmQphQpww,"Weehawken, NJ",4/7/2014,5,"We had an awesome time at this place. First let me preface by saying we had a large party. For large parties this place is great. If you have been here before you will know there are several large tables throughout the restaurant perfect for larger parties. What you may not know is they have a sampler menu that if six or more people at the table order, you can get. There are three different menus, depending on how hungry you are, and they are surprisingly reasonably priced. It includes a variety of appetizers, multiple main courses and dessert. The food was amazing as you would expect at this establishment, and the service amazing. Our server, Erin, made the evening even more enjoyable. In addition the drinks were great. There is one called tranquility which I recommend. Thanks for reading and enjoy!"

There's nothing I'd say not to order! Favourite thing on the menu is the pork belly/pork buns. Wow! Always order 1 main less than you think you need, it's family style dining and big portions and you need  to make room for that bread pudding! YUM."

Deborah S.,/user_details?userid=6TksU1YXrNZoyFiShtdueg,"Manhattan, NY",12/24/2015,1,I couldn't have been more clear about my food allergy to the waiter.

I value my health and won't be back.
Ayesha H.,/user_details?userid=rkfsDvgun58X1u5JoMw4_Q,"Miami, FL",12/14/2016,5,The food is incredible and the drinks were delicious. I definitely visit this place whenever I'm in the city.
Nathan S.,/user_details?userid=O5RDEFBGMPyASOlblmUfPA,"Brooklyn, NY",3/2/2015,3,"Overrated. Overpriced. Nice room. Good place to impress the easily impressed. If good Chinese cuisine is what your after, skip the pretension and head to Mott St."
Atiya B.,/user_details?userid=OU7qmQZeDzxkd-HJLP69bg,"New York, NY",10/8/2014,4,"This place has a great ambiance and is cool to be at- the food is pretty good, but for the price I don't know if it's completely worth it. It's definitely somewhere I'd recommend you going at least once-- it's a very ""NYC Experience"" type of place."
Tim K.,/user_details?userid=UcPcktJafke7TtkhHrJcIg,"Brooklyn, NY",12/11/2014,2,"Was severely disappointed by the service and all of teh plates were over-priced. That being said the food was pretty good and the architecture of the place is fascinating. This place would be 3 or 4 stars in most any city, but in NYC it is definitely not worth revisiting."
Andie T.,/user_details?userid=UuAYkxFLcZz8s9I-88qEbg,"Manhattan, NY",4/27/2015,4,I surprised my sister for dinner here for her bachelorette party. Every single thing we ate was delicious ESPECIALLY the sesame shrimp toast and edamame dumplings. You have to have it or you'll be sad you missed out.
Zoh Z.,/user_details?userid=0BnUSTiBr6EhVFSsf66-Jw,"Salt Lake City, UT",6/10/2016,5,Love this place! What a great experience... The interior is so nice and exotic and the food is AMAZING! It's on the expensive side but is totally worth it
Christina P.,/user_details?userid=5Nv7jbjNYjKqBakuO-IUcQ,"Brooklyn, NY",8/1/2016,3,It's okay the decor is breath taking the service is cray the food was so so wouldn't go back not worth the price of what your getting. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything spectacular
Kat J.,/user_details?userid=_Z-x_Pjmr1MDWzJaJWAEPQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2/21/2017,4,"The food here never disappoints, and the setting is lovely.

J C.,/user_details?userid=YWoRZY5TOLS7U4Tu8LqyMw,"Cold Spring Harbor, NY",2/21/2015,4,"So good and not nearly the scene it used to be. Awesome décor, a fun place but loud.

Militza P.,/user_details?userid=EsLuByPHn4A_Lw3HrqNZNg,"Bay Area, CA",4/27/2014,4,"Fun place to go with friends for a lively atmosphere and delicious drinks. However, in my opinion, either a hit or miss with the food, so be careful with what you order!"

Lauren B.,/user_details?userid=lVwrMXIzOfLNFM5YfsJxAg,"Andover, MA",9/26/2014,4,"I was there for a bachelorette last weekend, and there were about 10 of us in the party. Our waiter was fantastic- he paid us a lot of attention and even gave us all own our bills (we didn't have to ask). On top of the great service, the food was amazing! The only two complaints I had were that the food took forever to come out (I know there were 10 of us, but the food comes out as it's ready and my noodles took over an hour) and it's a bit pricey. Other than that I highly recommend this place!"
Laurel J.,/user_details?userid=XN3mhilZHPJBr_b0wtJMBg,"Brooklyn, NY",8/19/2013,4,"Love buddakan been coming here for years the drinks are great and the bread pudding is to die for, and you can't go wrong with the lobster egg rolls or the blackened cod this place is 2 things delicious and beautiful. The service is excellent the wait stagf is polite and attentive, even the dudes walking around in suits and ear pieces are friendly and complimentary. Only qualm is the cocktails leave alot to be desired. If your looking for a great drink I suggest you head to a bar after your meal."
Donny T.,/user_details?userid=f1aSfWRHIYhZXUAyjrb-pQ,"Brooklyn, NY",11/30/2014,4,I took my girlfriend here for her birthday on a Saturday night. The wait time was minimal with reservations.

The elevation and the tranquility drinks. They were both outstanding and extremely refreshing. The place was packed and loud. The bartender was very nice. We will have to try out the food next time we are in town.

Sam P.,/user_details?userid=V4H81_bLC_Dw_LgGDEY8Hg,"Guttenberg, NJ",4/8/2016,2,"The first time I came here was great.  One of the best decorated restaurants in New York combined with excellent service.  The next time I went I didn't walk out with the same enthusiasm.  First off, we were told we couldn't get our table until all 3 of us had arrived (2 of us were there).  This is typical of most NY restaurants, so nothing against Buddakan there.  We found an open table near the bar area and sat down to order some appetizers as we waited for our third member.  A couple next to us was vegetarian and had their orders messed up 3 times (3!).  The service they received was nothing short of amateur.  They were told their food was free of meat the second time and had to wait a good 10 minutes for the waitress to come back so they could ask why something looked off in their dish.  By the time their dish was messed up 3 times, a manager came and apologized but the damage was already done.  As an onlooker and a vegetarian, we did not feel like staying anymore."

Sammy S.,/user_details?userid=gvtlJ2uJsloyfPuWnj41rw,"Chicago, IL",1/19/2015,4,"There is no comparison, Buddakan in my opinion a nice place to have a delicious dinner . You can get a good food, great ambiance, expect the very best in service, cleanliness and courtesy at good prices."
Maresa W.,/user_details?userid=LHfWzW9TDGN5KE43A91Ouw,"Tysons, VA",9/2/2017,5,"Delish!  Our server was excellent in offering suggestions for our first visit.  We enjoyed the oxtail dumplings which was not something we were leaning towards. Definitely recommend getting these!  For entrees we had the charred steak and the shrimp - my husband and I shared and agree they were equally amazing!  The steak was so tender it could have been cut with a fork, the shrimp were large and perfectly prepared.  We also shared the wok charred broccoli and lobster fried rice.  Our least favorite thing was the rice and we wish we had ordered more broccoli!  We are not big drinkers, so we tried the nonalcoholic drink - I can't remember the name, but it had cranberry and pomegranate juices - so refreshing and light!  At the end of our meal our server surprised us with dessert for our anniversary.  It was a coconut mouse with a passion fruit center.  A wonderful ending to a perfect meal.  Service was top notch from the beginning to end.  I read a review prior to going and the person said if they had walked out of the restaurant and died, they would have died happy....  I second that!"
Jenny B.,/user_details?userid=tl7h8QNcRSH6fJ3DLoC0MA,"San Jose, CA",10/20/2013,2,"Edamame dumplings were nothing special, actually nothing was special. General tso soup dumplings were vastly inferior to the ones at Prosperity Dumpling in Chinatown."

After seeing the layout at the bottom of the stairs I wish I would've requested to sit in that area. Very cool and trendy. The four of us each ordered something different and shared. The steak and shrimp were outstanding. We did the same for dessert and were equally impressed. Wish I could remember more but will definitely go back."

You will really feel grown and sexy eating here. The staff was very very helpful, and I appreciated that as I was having a very bad night, but they helped  to make everything better. The food was good and the drinks were amazing! A bit pricey, but well worth it for the atmosphere, location, and service you receive. This is a great place for large crowds or a super sexy date nite. Everyone should experience Buddakan at least once."

Even though the service could be a little better because It took a while for the waiter to come, everything else was nothing less of phenomenal.  The ambience of the restaurant is not like many places in NYC. . The drinks were very strong yet made so well that you couldn't taste the alcohol( We hot the Royal and it creeped up on us).Then the 3 of us split coconut vegetable rice, Mongolian Lamb Chops and the Chili Chicken. Although the portions were very small,the food tasted so fresh, healthy and flavorful. It was definitely the best Asian food I've ever had!"

We decided to give Buddakan a taste. I was totally disappointed. I think the Yelp reviews had me so convinced that my experience would be ""over the top"" but it was a complete let down. The food was okay. The service was fine. The ambience sucked! Everyone says that the ambiance is incredible. Our table was in a really dark area of the restaurant near the bathrooms. Not impressed. For starters I got the pork belly hosin glazed. It was meh....For main entree i ordered the whole peking duck. It was okay. My wife ordered the steamed sole which was fine, but just not awesome like I expected. Hey you live and learn. I doubt I'll go back to Buddakan. Too many great restaurants in NYC. Hope this helps."
Rich S.,/user_details?userid=sYP-SyLJ-VCnJa-No2zR3Q,"Washington, DC",9/29/2006,3,Asian-fusion places usually give you very small portions but not Buddahan.  That is about the only good thing I have to say.  All portions were served luke warm except for one scalding hot dish and the food was average. Sure the space is great and Sara Jessica Parker was there but the crowd is a bit trashy.  Go to Tao instead.
Saachi S.,/user_details?userid=RL4pP2ulsGH5hYLCYfrBDA,"Manhattan, NY",6/19/2016,4,"4.5 stars--yet another NYC favorite that consistently delivers after several visits. The trendy, upbeat ambiance is certainly what steals the show but the food and cocktails are absolutely delicious and worth returning for as well. Would recommend planning far in advance--weekend reservations book up quickly. Looking forward to our next visit!"
Christopher H.,/user_details?userid=kIYy00ymm-Ta7sZAN8eFZQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/10/2017,5,Worth every penny!  The atmosphere is amazing and the food is Superb!  Excellent location and right in the middle of Meat Packing and the heart of New York City night life.

Johann B.,/user_details?userid=HHVQfk9j_-gMk2KWj0W6xQ,"Piscataway Township, NJ",2/27/2015,4,Pricey but good food. If you are looking for a real NY Sex in the City vibe this is the place.
Heidi B.,/user_details?userid=Ha_vTu7LVo1aPV_lNsMyqw,"Cherry Hill, NJ",3/14/2007,5,"Went here for my birthday dinner:) I have been to the one in Philadelphia two years ago so was anxious to finally try this out. The food here is delicious. You must get the crispy calamari salad and I actually gave in and tried the Peking Duck! Atmosphere is amazing, service one of the best I have had(They sat all of us right away without reservations) and  the food was a perfect ten. I would  recommend coming here during the week instead of the weekend where it can get a bit cheesy!"
Amy D.,/user_details?userid=MXCCnETsseLeWKKO8vWFLQ,"Pleasantville, NJ",4/23/2014,3,Wasn't thoroughly impressed. Atmosphere was really good along with mixed drinks. Maybe it's because I'm Asian but I've definitely had better fusion food.
Sophia P.,/user_details?userid=XU1AuMJlE9ALytZ3Y7F8gQ,"Mineola, NY",4/22/2014,2,"I had really high hopes for this place. The decor is gorgeous. The drinks are expensive, but delicious. I really didn't like the food. Everything we ordered just tasted very simple and reminded me of overpriced Chinese food. Really not impressive. The dessert was delicious, but I don't think I'll be returning here just for the drinks and dessert."

Staff is super attentive and professional. The bar tenders are always on point with their drinks! Would come here for any occasion! One of my favorite restaurants in the city!!"

There are cool cocktails on the menu and I must admit our meal was FABULOUS....but the scene leaves a lot to be desired. It's definitely not what Spice Market used to be....people were pretty cheesy. If you can get past the crowd and just enjoy the food, it's worth a visit."

Brent G.,/user_details?userid=o32KL_a5EDjYYgu71SnBYg,"Manhattan, NY",12/28/2014,2,"Full of avid Sex And the City fans and tourists who go there to be seen, for the check in, and the instagram selfie picture. The food is by no means horrible and I'm always open to Asian fusions so if you're complaining about how buddakan pales in comparison to some hole in the wall Chinatown spot you were clearly barking up the wrong tree to begin with. Not a place I would go back to myself but I wouldn't kick and scream if a friend really wanted to go back. The likelihood if that is pretty low though"

Swanky crowd, and great food, even by this picky vegetarian's standards. For the fellow veg-heads out there, try the edamame dumplings and scallion pancakes to start. the coconut curry rice entre was delish, and ya can't go wrong with the tofu vegetables and green beans (but both of those were fairly standard fare.. nothing exciting). most importantly, the waiter knew the difference between vegan and lacto-vegan and vegetarian... how cool is that. brownie points for definitional awareness."

Naz K.,/user_details?userid=C6Xvm6AYE68v92_JDtE4fg,"Annandale, VA",2/22/2014,4,One of our favorites in the city. Love the edamame dumplings and rock shrimp! Great ambience and perfect for a date night or girls night out. The service is also great.
Chad R.,/user_details?userid=eKpClGcH2afw2tvzZVOzBA,"San Diego, CA",5/27/2014,4,The ambiance is amazing...can't think of too many other spaces in NYC...so big!  The service is attentive.  We got there on the early side for dinner...and had lots of check-ins early on.  As business picked up a little less so.  Most of the food was pretty spectacular...a few missed.  The menu has lots of asian fusion variety and the prices are pretty reasonable considering the amount of overhead to run a place that size in NYC.

Houda S.,/user_details?userid=WeZ8O9JE_yFTw8oBXF8wLA,"Manhattan, NY",5/22/2014,2,I came here for my graduation dinner with family. I'm not complaining Abt the service in general (which was not so amazing). I am mainly concerned Abt smth more important: their tuna tartare was so bad. Tasted like blood and nothing like a tuna tartare. We were just at STK the night before and we had a great tuna tartare. After having this tuna tartare here at buddakan (not sure if it's really tuna) I felt nauseous right away. My sister felt the same too. I'm really concerned Abt this as it's a health issue more than it is smth that didn't come out tasty. Also the rock shrimp was not good. It was mainly a fries shell with nth inside (couldn't taste shrimp inside). Really disappointed that I made this choice for my grad dinner (although I have been here many times before and used to think it's fine). Now I know this place is getting so bad.. Unfortunately !!

Paula C.,/user_details?userid=s-CoxtZAP3Z1stGnTmnV-g,"Manhattan, NY",2/13/2014,4,"Went to Buddakan for my husband's and my birthday. We started with drinks at the ultra trendy lounge. Delish cocktails. The decor definitely make you feel sophisticated and like you are in one of MyC's hot spots. The different dinning rooms are beautiful. For food we started with the edamame dumplings. OMG Must haves, you would have nver had anything like it b4. We also shared the scallops. I had the Cod and my husband ordered the Short Ribs. Both were excellent. Very happy with my choices. Half way through the dishes though, we felt the dishes were overpowering. However side dishes of fresh cucumber and some other asian vegetable balanced the flavors well. The Lobster Rice was not worth it. Veery dry. I will probably try the sticky rice next time."
Kelly P.,/user_details?userid=RBohB-mYkrB4721lKi8j3Q,"Manhattan, NY",12/8/2014,4,"I ALWAYS visit this place when I come to NYC.  The drinks are unique and their edamame dumplings are to die for!  I know it sounds weird but trust me you have to order them, they melt in your mouth.  The short ribs are also fabulous as well as the sea bass roll.  Highly recommend this place for a fun date night or group dinner!"

Marie R.,/user_details?userid=npsERTMbyKLotgpbf2Z6WQ,"Chesapeake, VA",11/30/2013,4,Great food.  Price should be less.  Tuna tartare was interesting...too eggy though IMO.  Cod entree was delicious...nice and buttery.  Wok noodles were so so.  Cocktails were TOO SMALL! For that price I expected a bigger glass.  Overall great service and atmosphere.  Will definitely come again to try other menu items.

Told to wait at the bar and they'll find us, had a couple drinks and off we were. Walked down through the main dining hall and into the low-lit back room. The people seated next to us were closer than we'd like but they were caught up in their own lil world (read: kissy kissy, smoochy smoochy). Our food was amazing and beautifully presented. The wine and dessert were orgasmic. Our fave Top Chef contestant Dale was off that day (boo!) but we had a great time. One of the best dining experiences ever!"

Bartender was awesome, let us sample the Valentine's Day cocktails and the bill was only $30 (thanks dude!!!) and we had tons to drink.

Well priced compared to other restaurants in the city. Went with a girlfriend, we shared the chili shrimp as a starter, lobster fried rice, prawn noodles, lemon chicken (AMAZING), and the green been dish. Still thinking about the food, NOT joking."
Cam H.,/user_details?userid=wZq3ZdNOJH4LI4nPx-bckA,"Chapel Hill, NC",3/3/2014,4,"The ambiance here is great - the main dining room is stunning, the bar area is huge and comfortable, tons of seating and room to spread out and relax. The bartender knows what he's doing. Dining service wasn't superb and neither was the food, but I would give them both 3/5 stars. The menu is short and VERY fish heavy. Appetizers reign supreme, the entrees fall short - if I were to return, I'd probably just order dim sum in mass quantities. In the end, I much prefer Tao or Hakkasan, both of which offer a nearly identical experience and tout a more varied, mature menu. That being said, I doubt you'll hate Buddakan, and it's not a bad choice."

Everything was exceptional from the app to the dessert. I wouldn't normally order a coffee from an Asian restaurant but they even nailed that. The attention to detail in the decor is unreal as was the service.

Andre L.,/user_details?userid=23RRdZofs1E3jUBWTYdGHQ,"New York, NY",9/28/2008,5,"Buddakan is phenomenal!   Great restaurant, I've been here so many times and I still love it.  You have to try the pork belly steamed buns, the crab fried rice, and the sizzling short rib.  Great ambiance, great scene (be prepared for major b&t representation on the weekends), and great drinks.  Perfect place if you want to have dinner and stick around for drinks after wards.  The Meatpacking District is getting old but this place should be kept on the radar for any kind of dinner whether its a date, group, bday, or you want to impress someone from out of town."
Emily J.,/user_details?userid=RORrWniaUl8nseq47oLOyg,"Chicago, IL",9/2/2012,5,"An easy 5 star experience. Buddakan features contemporary Asian fusion cuisine is served in an eclectic setting. Visitors are deceived by the small, almost unmarked façade of this restaurant which opens up to an enormous Baroque style dining room. Be sure to sip on the ""Tranquility"" drink while you enjoy chili rock shrimp, soft crab fried rice, and a mean almond toffee bread pudding. Keep an eye out for the decor details, they are as unique as the food served here. I will definitely be back to try more menu items and more cocktails!"
Jammie W.,/user_details?userid=oy2ZQoMectE1BRdop7qNbg,"Manhattan, NY",1/1/2015,4,Love this place.... Its a lil on the expensive side but if your going here it shouldnt be a problem or your clearly in the wrong place. Only bad thing is the lighting and it may just be personal but its really dark. other than that its amazing! the foods always cooked perfectly.
Edward I.,/user_details?userid=Gw4UiyZjER7GuyGbwSRIQw,"Jersey City, NJ",6/7/2006,4,"It's about 3 blocks from the 2/3 train, not a bad location. The prices are above average, but worth it if you're having a special event. Go for the Mongolian ribs. I'm bringing my sister here when she comes from California to prove that there's actually room in NYC."
Sascha M.,/user_details?userid=h_yDKWk3mMu4YtWxiLjGTQ,"New York, NY",10/20/2010,3,Another one of the typical trendy Asian fusion spots.  Out of towners love coming here.  I love the tuna tartare  and  edamame dumplings here and the lychee martini.  I've also been here for late night drinkies and partying and had  solid time.
Annette M.,/user_details?userid=OdBMI9tsNvObvd2ad7CdNA,"Pittsburgh, PA",11/1/2011,5,"What can I say? Buddakan is amazing.  I love the swanky, indulgent atmosphere, which comes refreshingly sans any degree of annoying pretentiousness.  I have been here twice now and I have adored everything I have ever tried.  My personal favorites are the tuna tartare spring rolls, the chili rock shrimp, and the lobster fried rice.  Bonus points for consistently fantastic service."
Jessica N.,/user_details?userid=d7p2LJ9GeSE2QKJSm2JvcQ,"Bothell, WA",6/16/2016,5,"This is my second time dining here (first time in Atlantic City,) and both meals have been worthy of 5 stars. All plates came out at the perfect temperature to enjoy all of the flavors. The food is very good, none of it feels greasy or fatty even when things are fried, and service is amazing. I highly recommend the tuna tartare rolls and the oxtail dumplings. Will definitely be coming back again."
Michael L.,/user_details?userid=Ly3gDLoBaxNFwYPWJeQPtQ,"New York, NY",5/7/2007,5,"Went here with my parents on a Sunday night after fretting a bit that the place might be too ""hip,"" but the experience was excellent all around. Extremely friendly/helpful waitstaff, surprisingly good wine, trendy but not over-the-top decor and food that's downright transplendent; the lamb was perfectly cooked, the edamame dumplings were way beyond what I'd expected, and the (new-to-the-menu) chocolate pudding was so good I wanted to rent it a hotel room."

Anne F.,/user_details?userid=sG1kiBTVFd4Qdif7YrNdkQ,"New York, NY",4/13/2016,4,"Beautiful restaurant, good food and drinks.  The only issue was that the waiter suggested too much food. We ordered 1 appetizer, 1 entree, 1 side of vegetables and 1 curry rice.  Plenty for two people.  We really liked everything except for the lobster egg rolls.  The egg rolls did not have much flavor.   The pepper beef was one of the best meals of my life.  We'll be back!"
Leslie A.,/user_details?userid=JfBws8Ai0Wu-Fy0GhyE4Eg,"Jersey City, NJ",5/31/2008,5,"This has quickly become one of my very favorite places in NY!  Everything about it was great from the service, the decor, the music and especially the food.  You have to try the rock shrimp and mushroom chow fun, they are absolutely fabulous!"

Everything from the different dumplings, short ribs, spring rolls and desserts were delicious and familiar enough to be tried and enjoyed by all but different enough to not be tiresome. The only knock is the acoustics/sound makes it such that it was hard to hear exactly what it was that you were getting."
Iron M.,/user_details?userid=Z0xCTqsbY1xqobypRrKWJg,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",4/6/2014,4,"Swan, funky and cool. Nothing that hasnt been said before. Average service and extended wait time (30 mins) inspite of having a reservation and will a gazillion people on a Wednesday, i am not surprised. my favorite part however was the delicious vegetable fried rice and great carrot dumplings! will definitely visit!"
Vanessa G.,/user_details?userid=eR9u-Sq8n2dKNS9Bs1Kpqg,"Manhattan, NY",1/1/2015,4,Very busy and crowded in the evenings. It's a mixed crowd and the wait for the tables is too long even with an appointment. But the food was great. Small portions. I strongly recommend the proseco drink outstanding!!!

The restaurant is so massive and beautiful that the walk to your table is an experience in and of itself. The food was delicious and our server went the extra mile to walk us through the menu and outline dishes best suited for a gluten-free diet.

I'm giving 4 stars because on my last visit, the lamb chops were not tender. They were tough and fatty. However, that's one meal out of many over 4 visits to this establishment. The place is beautiful and is quite an immersive experience in addition to a culinary delight. I recommend it!"
Karla A.,/user_details?userid=gb4dG9nBL3WRqqp3HEb7sw,"Middle Village, NY",7/31/2014,5,"Excellent place, they are always really busy no matter what day of the week. I have been to buddakan on several occasions and it's still my favorite restaurant for several reasons. The food is tasty, and I always look forward to their almond bread pudding, it tastes like heaven! I cannot wait to go back."
Shevonne D.,/user_details?userid=VuR0OqZE5RjXBKOhS_yWXg,"Brooklyn, NY",11/14/2013,3,"This was my first time here and I'll admit I enjoyed the ambiance/decor more than the food. I ordered the General Tso dumplings (delicious) with the Chinese Sausage Fried Rice w egg (the rice was a bit too course for my liking) Overall, the service was great, but the food could have been a little better. I give it a 6 out of 10."
Andrea S.,/user_details?userid=1nyFQNLoOmxYQY29mu1RtA,"Ashburn, VA",3/19/2016,5,Beautiful sexy decor matched with simply amazing food! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The service here is top notch as well. We were celebrating a special event and they took very good care of us.

Anderson L.,/user_details?userid=zEZnKvSQJ_79eOEYAkO_GQ,"Orange, CA",10/30/2010,5,"Wow, for starters, i typically do not like fusion food, especially when served tapas style. just never been a fan of this type of food. buddakan is a rare exception i must say. to start, the ambiance gets a soaring 5 star rating. easily the most grand entrance/dining setup i've seen in a long while. the place is HUGE, and very well decorated with nice loungy background music. service staff was excellent and very attentive. and most importantly, the food was simply delicious. everything we ordered was good - vege stir fry, string beans, cod, branzino, short ribs, beef loin, apptizer platter, the list goes on (we ordered quite a bit of food). In general, the food here was just awesome and very well presented. i'd come back in a flash, and once again, from a tapas, asian fusion food hater, i'm giving this place a rarely issued 5 star!"
Cessie C.,/user_details?userid=EuhLCKMk7CMrS5MpOsofWw,"Manhattan, NY",11/29/2012,4,"Of course this place is famous for hosting Carrie & Big's famous rehearsal dinner before the wedding on Sex & the City.  I had a delicious meal there and it was everything I expected, pricey, delicious, trendy with a great atmosphere. But doesn't leave you sooooo disgustingly full that you can't go out for a night of dancing afterwards. My fav was the lobster fried rice, the Chile rock shrimp. Drinks are pricey- and that's where they get you. But it's def a MUST in meatpacking!"
Marissa T.,/user_details?userid=OsMMqrAPsSlLxC9UltV1Nw,"San Diego, CA",12/13/2013,4,"It was cold outside, and Buddhakan was warm and inviting. I had dinner there yesterday and my friend and I agreed that the ""Shrimp Toast"" is a must try here. It was incredibly crispy and hot. They cook their food from the sea with so much freshness and yum!! For example, I had the black cod, and it was incredible, not dry at all, and paired with some sort of mushroom tower. I thought the table for 2 was a bit small for a place that serves dim sum and many choices of appetizers. We wanted to try them all!!  The mixed drinks were just ok, I tried their oolong tea vodka and my friend had the mixed prosecco.  The ambiance was breathtaking with chandeliers and modern zen, and the waiter was super."
G C.,/user_details?userid=Ahhy874Lj2pKPOO8ZI5JlQ,"Atlanta, GA",7/22/2016,5,This place is always a surprise. I came here several times and I am amazed at the size of the restaurant and quality control in the kitchen. Every dish here has been very good. I would highly recommend this restaurant.

We came here with a group of 8, and everyone had a blast. They have a huge staircase that takes you downstairs where they have additional seating. But the huge staircase means that the ceilings are really high, at least in part of the space, which I love. We all ordered cocktails (tasty!) and lots of dishes to share. The Dim Sum is great! We had the edamame dumplings, jade shrimp dumplings, boneless spare ribs and steamed bass roll. We also shared the tea smoked pepper beef, lobster fried rice, glazed alaskan black cod and sweet and crispy jumbo shrimp. All excellent! A pricey evening, so make it count for special occasions!"
Evelyn D.,/user_details?userid=Sh7aWdeUemj65Y0Sfvf77Q,"Hialeah, FL",10/31/2010,4,"You might remember this place from the first Sex & The City Movie where Carrie and Mr. Big host their rehearsal dinner or where Carrie asks Mr. Big for her ""last single girl's kiss"". This was one of the stops on the Sex & The City tour, mesmerized by the decor we decided to make reservations for later that evening. Because we were on the tour we received a coupon for a Cosmo with a purchase of an appetizer. Dressed in labels and fun we arrived to the restaurant, our table was not ready yet we were directed to wait in the lounge area where we had some drinks. The lighting was very very dim (it was kind of annoying, reason for not earning the 5th star), the waitress found us among the sea of single women and walked us to our table, conveniently situated next the long table that appeared in the movie. We ordered 3 appetizers (lobster eggs rolls, edamame dumplings, vegetable dumplings) we also ordered vegetable fried rice with a coconut curry sauce. The food was irresistibly amazing! Dessert we shared the chocolate peanut butter bombe, to die for! The place is great, the epitome of New York chic. We overheard someone talking about Miami being the next home for Buddakan, I am crossing my fingers, legs, and toes that there is truth to that!"

eLLe D.,/user_details?userid=9magxXfMem2swrsTQgjG2w,"New York, NY",8/22/2012,3,"Came here for a friends birthday dinner earlier in the year. We met in the upstairs area, which was very dark and packed. I think theres was little ambiance music playing. We were placed at one end of the long table downstairs. A party of about 12 people. There was another group dining on the other end. My friend chose this place because they had options for his vegan diet. I dont remember most of what we had, I tasted everyones plates and just knocked back glasses of prosecco. The food was all just ok, nothing irreplaceable or memorable. I do remember though the waiter was impatient and had plenty of attitude for us. Nothing really urging me to return, again it is out of my way in the meatpacking, but if I were to return, I would probably just kick it in the small lounge area upstairs."
Tanmoy M.,/user_details?userid=G6gIFA3FtSEojRo7_QiAtg,"Hoboken, NJ",10/3/2016,5,"rock shrimp, edamame dumplings, miso cod. wonderful food with a lively atmosphere.  great bar as well."
Daniela V.,/user_details?userid=tS6EM-WDPijzf8rdANWJgw,"Manhattan, NY",7/17/2014,5,"Definitely worth going, although expensive the experience and the food were great. The service was good.

John H.,/user_details?userid=cYEUUcA_PoQfwUQChZGqLQ,"New York, NY",12/3/2014,3,"This restaurant has ok food. I wouldn't say it's the greatest in the world, and would recommend other japanese restaurants. Favorite so far in New York is Yasuda Sushi."
Crissy H.,/user_details?userid=-hxUwfo3cMnLTv-CAaP69A,"Warwick, NY",12/12/2009,3,"Okay let me start off by staying that this place is to die for when it comes to decor. It is top notch! Out of this world. When it comes to food it is Ok. Not the best I have ever had (which is disappointing since it is a bit pricy) but still pretty good. Of course at a place like this you have to get a bunch of different things to share. I won't going into everything since the majority of the things I had are already talked about on other reviews. The only thing I want to point out is the lobster and scallop fried rice. It was amazing. Defiantly something I would want to get again! Overall I am glad that I tried this place, but I would not be itching to come back again. There are way to many other places I need to try in NYC first :-)"
Linda D.,/user_details?userid=j5TfR0iToBzOTRsstWavuA,"Forest Hills, NY",1/7/2013,5,"This place still gets me excited. I have been coming here for years and this place still ranks my fave which is ironic since chinese cuisine is my least favorite type of food but that's how good this place is! The resturant is huge yet comfortable, very trendy, just a great space. The edamame dumplings, scallion pancakes, spring rolls, deviled tuna tartare are all great starters. I absolutey love the short rib entree and the black cod dish is to die for. We always get an order of the lobster fried rice and it never disappoints! And no matter how full we are we always get dessert the peanut buter chocolate...heavenly. Love love love this place."
Brianna S.,/user_details?userid=_srNWePXyYlGt4-IcT_wwg,"Brooklyn, NY",12/2/2014,4,"If you are a fan of asian dining combined with some club music , buddakan is the place to go.

Every meal was delish. For dessert I ordered the decadent crying chocolate which was decorated with a birthday candle which was a very nice touch!!...I gotta come back for cocktails!!...Definitely come to Buddakan for appetizers, cocktails and dinner because you'll enjoy it!!....:)"

Their renowned ""must try"" edamame dumplings were mediocre and for the amount they're charging you for each dish, one would expect a lot more in the presentation. The beef lettuce cups were literally one itsy bitsy beef medallion on a bed of one itsy bitsy lettuce. Who are we feeding here, munchkins? Almond bread pudding is the only worthwhile item on the menu. If I were you, I would be out of there in a NY minute."

The bartender was Fantastic & so professional.  Loved it from the moment i set my foot till the end.. I can't wait to go back again & again."

The cocktails were great, and every dish I tried was better than the last. The edamame dumplings which sounded pretty dull, were probably the best thing I ate all night. Could have eaten three servings of them as my meal."

Stephanie H.,/user_details?userid=URLdYiYKC9HC5cde1BGpmw,"San Francisco, CA",1/27/2008,4,"I went here for my first time, on Wednesday night, while I was in NY for work. This place is Huge! The food was very good....we ordered 4 appetizers, 4 entrees to share (for 4 of us - it was plenty / too much food) I loved the Filet of Beef, the Steamed Sea Bass Rolls, the Edamame Dumplings (you have to try them, I've never had anything like it), the Crying Chocolate for dessert = heaven. I would definitely venture back here. So good!"

They said 25 minutes till we could get a table, so we went to the bar, ordered drinks, took a few sips, when they came to seat us after 5 minutes. But best of all, two separate staff complimented my gorgeous date.. which had me doing a little touchdown dance in my head."

I came here after the SATC movie came out and I wanted to be at the same place where Carrie & Big had their engagement. Impressive! I'd come back."
Jessica D.,/user_details?userid=Hs6QEEoPnrf-QksDiioDtg,"New York, NY",6/25/2018,3,"First time coming here because I had it on my to go list & one of my friends recommended I go here, when I arrived I told my boo this looks really boogie because we saw a whole bunch of people outside really dressed up like if they was going to an event. We had reservations for 10:30 we made it on time they tell us to wait by the bar while they get the table ready . As soon as we got a drink at the bar the lady comes & tell us that our table is ready literally mins after arriving at the bar. So inconvenient! We get sat at a table which I loved I didn't feel like I was out in the open , we was looking at the menu & the first page is basically appetizer & next page are the plates. When I saw what I like I asked the server how does it come he gave me an explanations the plate , told him I'll have that then tells me it's an appetizer then I'm like Uhm ok had to look again threw my menu but nothing catched my eyes , the second time he came by he literally explained the menu by telling us that nothing comes with a side , would have been helpful if he had asked us if this is our first time here & explained the menu from the get instead it took him 2 times to come to us & explain it . I got ribs which was okay they where spicy & I also got the lobster dumplings which I didn't really like . My boo order the whole sea bass & he said it was to sweet but I loved it . With a side of greens which was also good but had to much oil . Overall  okay restaurant"
Ashley M.,/user_details?userid=96QNekRAo6wrBEJgDt5xSg,"Brooklyn, NY",9/10/2014,5,"AMAZING! The venue is SO beautiful. The best way to describe the food is ""FLAVORFUL"". The cocktails....even better. The only down side is that I was not too impressed with the lobster fried rice, but I see no reason to take away a star for that. You can't go wrong choosing Buddakan. :)"

Karyn S.,/user_details?userid=jxlnNkJNZASQR-uIPL4gpg,"Brooklyn, NY",10/22/2012,4,"I have been to Buddakan probably 15 times now and it has been 100% consistent every time. This is not where you come with your cool friends, they'll think you're nuts to suggest it. But don't be a snob. Bring your own of town guests here. It's perfect for that. It's spacious, pretty, the food is really good, and the service is always amazing. It feels like an event, especially for people from out of town. I took my parents here this weekend and it was just so NICE to take my little old small town folks somewhere that felt hip to them so they felt ""New York"" and no one there talked down to them or looked down at them or made us feel stupid. And for those who say it's expensive, I really don't know what they're talking about. 3 of us each had a cocktail, we shared 5 plates I think, we had 2 desserts, and it was $150. You don't get better than this for $50 a head."
Matthew M.,/user_details?userid=hPHKXMOogZF6Bnh8tb1L8g,"Burbank, Los Angeles, CA",2/13/2014,5,"I've been here twice and its one of my favorite restaurants in New York City.  Everything on the menu seems to be executed perfectly.  The service is also attentive and friendly without being bothersome.

Eddie G.,/user_details?userid=tJcyPulE5wtsd4mhhejWmw,"New York, NY",2/11/2014,3,"I was invited here in February of 2014 for a $55 brunch with 6 friends. After going to the restroom, I noticed that parties of 2 were receiving the same amount of food that our party of 6 was receiving. For example, the 6 of us got 6 dumplings and the party of 2 also got 6 dumplings. The party of 2 got 4 spare ribs, our party of 6 got 4 spare ribs. We had to ask for more because there simply wasn't enough for everyone. Why would 6 people pay $55/each to get the same amount of food as 2 people? Very confusing and bizarre. Also, the prix-fixe menu didn't include any alcohol. Yikes. I won't be back for prix-fixe but I'll be back for a regular dinner."
Alex H.,/user_details?userid=f1T4jQvYW-0WL8W8mLTfVA,"Encinitas, CA",8/30/2007,4,"This past weekend I went with my GF to Buddakan. The place is a great spot to start your night in the Chelsea area. From the outside the place looks quite simple, but once inside I realized the scope of the place. We waited in a bar area for 5 mins until our table was ready. The strength of this place is the cool factor and thankfully the food. Tuna spring rolls, and dumplings in a sweet corn sauce were awesome. I recommend sharing the dishes, as the portions are moderate to small in size. For more old world Chinese/Asian try Wo Hop in Chinatown."

The fabulous staircase that leads you into the sunken dining room is beyond impressive. I didn't think the food would top the great decor and service but it did. The menu is designed for sharing which works out wonderful so you can try more of what Buddakan has to offer. Very unique drink menu. Highly recommended - first class restaurant in first class location. I'll be back!"

They were very friendly and accommodating and we had no problem getting a table at 9:30. Our host was not only VERY attractive, but he was very friendly as well. Our waitor was extremely pleasant and knowledgable of the menu. We didn't have to wait long at all for our food and everything was delicious and pretty reasonably priced for food and a restaurant of that caliber. The space is absolutely breathtaking, especially the huge chandeliers above the communal table downstairs. The music and the crowd only add to the beautiful and lively ambiance. I can't wait to go back, even if only for cocktails downstairs."
Teresa E.,/user_details?userid=CEyAXlCn5uUmb8tscMEAKw,"New York, NY",5/5/2008,4,"The main dining room looks like it came straight from the chateau of Louis XIV (think Versailles), AFTER he returned from antiquing in the orient. A long communal table cuts down the middle and there are banquettes along the sides--which are nice. The people seated facing ""out"" from said banquettes are treated to a spectacular view of the surroundings. Food and service are both excellent, although I still prefer the Philly location where I received my Buddakan baptism--as it were."

George C.,/user_details?userid=8RcEwGrFIgkt9WQ35E6SnQ,"New York, NY",3/25/2010,5,"Simultaneously old-fashioned & hip, Buddakan blends medieval decor with tropical fauna in a vast space that's very easy to walk right past. Came at 5:30 when they opened up for dinner and were sat downstairs, not in the lounge (which filled up quite quickly before we departed). The Calamari Salad appetizer was surprisingly flavorful, the chilled udon noodles the best I've had, and the Kung Pao monkfish was spectacularly spicy yet not overpowering. Service was solid, portions tremendous (especially for the value--though drinks were a bit steep), and the ambiance was certainly nicer once more folks arrived to drown out the tunes. Happy we hit it up before the Chef departed for Asia."

I thought the food was very good overall but nothing really made it stand out as special from other pan asian restaurants I have been too in this category. Would I return? Possibly if friends insisted on eating here, for now I will continue to explore until I find a somewhere with something much more unique that makes it self stand apart from the Buddakan / Hakkasan's of the world."

I mean i'm used to the chinatown chinese restaurants, or flushing... this one is different, it's like chinese restaurant run by europeans. Atmosphere was great, we didn't the get the private tables, 4 of us ended up on the big communal table but it was all good, enough room. Food was good. Had the deviled tuna tartare, foie gras eggroll, peking duck salad, ribeye, cod, lamb, lobster fried rice and mushroom noodle... pricey, expected that but great for the occasion. Mushroom chowfun...not that good but everything else were. Would i return? yes, for the atmosphere"

First walking into this place I was amazed by the great decor. It was what I pictured a hip NYC restaurant to look like. We were there for dinner and had the tuna tartare spring rolls, the black pepper beef, lobster fried rice and asian green stir fry. All the food was yummy and I especially enjoyed the black pepper beef and lobster fried rice. For dessert we had the crying chocolate. It was like a hot chocolate souffle cake with melted chocolate in the middle and jasmine tea ice cream. It was so good I want some just thinking about it. I guess the area that Buddakan is located is the trendy nightlife area. After dinner we stepped outside and had a vast selection of different lounges and night clubs in the area. A perfect ending to a perfect night."

Andrew Y.,/user_details?userid=p6nBKyT9Y_pFJ1WxVEowwA,"San Francisco, CA",3/8/2008,3,Buddakan was chosen as the location for a fancy dinner with my cousins. It looked pretty nice with its Asian decor. The food is all in a single serving size. They suggest getting one appetizer and entre per person. For 6 people our bill came to $500 (with alcohol). We had the house cocktail. it was tasty. Could have used some more alcohol. This place is good for groups and has coat check. I know this is a subpar review but there was not much else memorable about it.

The House Dj on Friday nights provides the perfect mood and tone for the energy of a Friday night in the Meat Packing District. If dining here with a party of 6 people, consider the Pre-Fix tasting Menu at around $65/person. Its a great deal and will be more food than you can imagine but a great way to see what the Chef can really do."

After being seated, the ambiance subsided a touch as many of the tables are acceptable/mediocre while others maintain the ambiance of the entry. The service was also somewhere between acceptable and positive. The food, served in a family-style theme, was absolutely tremendous. Delicious. I can't rave about the food and the specialty drinks enough. Overall, the experience was very, very good."
Tiffany T.,/user_details?userid=GWQbp-VEg7vLv2Sl5h4LJw,"San Jose, CA",5/28/2011,3,"Buddakan is beautiful, the entrance reminds me of checking into a hotel! I remember seeing it in Sex and the City  and always wondered where they were. It was honestly just as beautiful as the movie portrayed. We ordered drinks that were delicious and their egg rolls to munch on. I'm deducting stars from their review because the service is inefficient and honestly horrible. I saw a hostess looking around for her guests for a good 15 minutes because she was too scared to ask the wrong people...she literally circled and passed the correct couple  about 20 times. It took us an hour to get seated and we had a reservation. When we finally got seated and ordered, our waiter came back once to check on us and then disappeared. I had to call for someone else to get our check...the waiter was still no where to be seen. All in all, great food, great decor, horrible idiotic service."

The place was a bit dark and a bit noisy, but that's my only complaint.  Food was great, service was good and I recommend this if you are in th e meat-packing district.  OHH, I'm not from NYC, but would say this is a tad touristy because it's so popular.  So, if you aren't from NYC and visiting, this is a must.  :-)"

I don't remember the last time I was in such a beautifully-decorated restaurant. I thought the service was good, as our waitress was very friendly and helpful. She gave us a lot of tips, suggestions, and descriptions. However, the prices are a bit high-especially considering that the portions are only decent (not too small but certainly not large)."
Ramya B.,/user_details?userid=eDs8UE0GfTlc8bhEkZz6IQ,"Austin, TX",12/30/2015,4,"The boyfriend and I tried Buddakan for date night - we went there without a reservation and were told the lounge was first-come-first-served seating. For a crowded restaurant, we were able to find seating pretty quickly though it would have been awesome to get seated in the spacious Hogwarts-style tables in the restaurant. Our waitress was extremely helpful and had quite the cheery disposition. We decided to go vegetarian that night and there weren't too many dumpling options for us. So we ended up ordering the carrot dumplings, the grilled cauliflower and vegetable fried rice with coconut curry - the dumplings were kinda meh for my taste, the cauliflower was pretty decent, but what blew our minds was the coconut curry, so creamy and delicious and just the right portion! $14 wine glasses definitely tasted good and we ended the night with the 'Crying Chocolate' dessert that was on point. Definitely worth walking in rainy New York to get here."

Roman A.,/user_details?userid=J-A12tb13Wsrka1IoQzjlw,"Brooklyn, NY",11/6/2015,3,"I am giving Buddakan 3 stars because I had extremely high expectations going in. First let me start by saying the atmosphere and ambience in this place is worth the trip. I have been to many restaurants all over NYC and Buddakan really is special in terms of its setup and inside décor. Service was good...However the kitchen fell apart the night I went. I was in a party of 5 and one small appetizer came out every 15 minutes... we ordered 2 servings of pork buns and both came out over a 25 minute time span... It made us all very restless and hindered the 5 star experience. The second star reduction comes from the portion size and pricing of food. Is it work 60+ dollars for a duck??? I am not so sure... especially if it isn't out of this world (given I am a duck connoisseur). But overall the food was good... Nothing spectacular for the prices they are listed at (thus the reduction of the second star). Would I recommend this place??? Yes definitely, it should be on everyone's list, especially if you are looking for a upscale Asian cuisine restaurant and want to be a part of the chic money oriented crowd that usually attends.

Pree R.,/user_details?userid=5vt6mU3TvNfyTPVrhQ3frA,"New York, NY",10/25/2009,4,"In short, Buddakan can be summed up in 2 words: edamame dumplings.  I don't even LIKE edamame, but when it's dumplingized and creamy, apparently I love it.  And any trip to Buddakan without them would be akin to visiting Paris without catching a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower.  Actually, most of the appetizers and desserts are great, but the mains are a notch or two below.  Since everything is served family style, I'd recommend a tapas type approach with lots of appetizers instead of a multi-course meal.  And as far as the space, worth a visit in and of itself -- dual height ceilings, dim lighting, terrific vibe for a nice meal with friends, when the parents are in town, or on a date.  A great transplant from Philly -- now if only Tequila's would follow suit..."
Clyde J.,/user_details?userid=WGUZx_9C1TGyeQTIHMrQ4g,"Brooklyn, NY",12/10/2010,5,"WoW!  Love it! Great Place, Where should I start, hmm.. oh yess.

Sushma A.,/user_details?userid=66n2moiX-C3aZGiERmsOZA,"Brooklyn, NY",2/24/2012,5,Looove this place!!!.. It's really uniquely decorated and really decadent. Each room is different. I love the luxurious oriental  feel of Buddhakan. The food is not expensive and phenomenal!.. Really enjoyed the dishes which are a nice change from Thai options for Asian. Had a great time at this restaurant.

Glen H.,/user_details?userid=U6N17MEoMT50-Opry5fotQ,"Sydney, Australia",4/28/2016,5,Quality food and service- excellent experience. Lamb chops with ginger crust were very tasty. Nice ambience and great service. Not cheap- but worth it.

The atmosphere is beautiful beautiful."
Annie J.,/user_details?userid=_ZygzU9Rnu8DRkeUaBndow,"Columbus, OH",7/15/2014,5,We made a reservation after we came through the space on a Sex and the City Tour. It was for a Saturday night a few weeks ago so I never dreamed we'd be able to squeeze in with such short notice but the woman at the front desk was very helpful and fit us in. We were hoping to sit in the large area but were ushered into a red room in the back. It felt a little chaotic and the music was pretty loud but the server helped us settle in and made some excellent recommendations. I think I was most impressed with how nice everyone was from the front all the way to the end. If you are able to score a reservation asked to be seated with Leslie. We had the perfect meal and she even helped us sort out our plans for after dinner dancing.

Their edamame dumplings were good, the soup dumplings were disappointing and nothing else was memorable. I'm not really a fan of the decor either. I'd rather go to Chinatown and save my money."
Hani J.,/user_details?userid=eJljZIVBeRQFeilTKEMfhQ,"New York, NY",10/11/2010,3,"While I love their chocolate lava cake, today's dinner sucked (dishes came late and cold). Nonetheless, I will go back for that cake."
Maly A.,/user_details?userid=3Xxt0y4dOg-ewnudA8eWsw,"New York, NY",6/13/2011,5,"I love this place. Out of the upscale/trendy restaurants, this is probably one of my favorites spots. I've been to other places and spent the same $ but have not been as satisfied, either due food being nothing special or service not being super great. Here at Buddakan you get your money's worth every time. The ambiance is great, very trendy/posh, great decor, grand almost as you enter the main dining area. The service has always been excellent....and the food....phenomenal! Every bite ....deeeeelicious! We've had a New Year dinner here once a few years ago with a large group, brought several out of town friends here, and come for drinks with smaller groups of friends & birthday dinners etc. The experience has been great every time. Spot on! Cocktails are great, and even if you have reservations, chances are you will need to wait for a bit before getting your table, so definitely enjoy a drink by the bar & people watch. Great crowd, although due to its ever increasing popularity I do feel it has become a bit more touristy over the last couple of years. But hey, as long as those out-of-towners are spending money & supporting the NYC economy, why complain right? I love their spicy rock shrimp. Have had a variety of their streaks over my several trips & every time it has been cooked to perfection. Your bill can typically run anywhere between $60-$120 per person, depending on how many courses & drinks you order. Good date spot too as despite being a very large space, it has a very intimate feel to it. Ok.....so now I am really craving the food.....I think it's time for a trip back soon!"

Yoly O.,/user_details?userid=51sCtMXRTetmn4cYwlqp7Q,"Princeton, NJ",10/17/2011,4,"This restaurant is impressive and the big draw for tourists seems to be that a portion of the ""Sex In The City"" movie was filmed here.  With that said, it was annoying to be seated in a pretty dark atmosphere and have tourists constantly taking pictures and the flash blinding you.  We managed to enjoy our food, since it was well prepared and delicious.  The drinks were great.  A nice place if you don't mind the tourists and their inability to be considerate to other diners.  I would definitely say that Buddakan in Philadelphia is better than the one in New York, but our meal was good and it's a good place for Asian cuisine."
S M.,/user_details?userid=E_6rvv6YgMQr5xKDpDgn4A,"New York, NY",1/2/2012,1,"Went for dinner 1/1/12 HORRIBLE experience.  Upon entering took forever for hostess to even acknowledge you, even with there being 3 of them up there.  The restaurant was booked so had to sit in lounge where they offer full menu.  Service was HORRIBLE I have never had service like this before in NYC.  The waitress never even came to give us a menu took one off adjoining table.  Then she never even came to take order. I believe I gave my order to the manager who was walking around when I asked for a waitress to take my order.  When we finally got food it was mediocre best part of dinner was dessert the crying chocolate.  Don't believe the hype with this place. The ambiance is beautiful but for the price great service and food should come along with it.  If you go it's just to say you went."

I'm not so into the edamame dumplings, but was glad I tried them. The duck rolls are worth a trip in themselves. They serve family style, so it's nice and fun to be able to try more things. It does get loud and crowded the later you are there. The desserts are absolutely fantastic. I like to order a ton of dim sum and appetizers as they're the best. The vegetables are good sides. Prices are pretty reasonable too."

Brett M.,/user_details?userid=_oMQNIb3tPuWfTosEzUxGw,"Denver, CO",7/27/2013,5,Ambiance is impressive and alluring.  Everything we had was good and we were thankful that our waiter was very Gluten Free knowledgable.  I recommend sitting downstairs if you have a large party.  We had at least 25 people at our table and the service was still quick enough to get us through in time to have after dinner drinks before going onto our next event that evening.
Jae P.,/user_details?userid=S-dL1vulyN_9aWg6oD_9nQ,"Pasadena, Los Angeles, CA",12/2/2013,5,"Delicious. Everything we ordered was incredible. Scallion pancakes, Chili rock shrimp, lamb chop and black cod. The ""lounge"" is 1st come 1st serve and in my opinion is sexier atmosphere than the lower level or the main restaurant. It's darker and swankier with a bit more room. Stumbled on this spot while on a date night with the Hubbs and we'll definitely be back!"
Laureen R.,/user_details?userid=MoaF0t7bj9kWeoEdE9CASw,"Yonkers, NY",10/10/2013,4,The atmosphere is incredible and I love the communal table downstairs.  I've hosted parties using that space and it was always a big hit.  The best pork buns and soup dumplings and they do an amazing cucumber cocktail that I always crave.  I think the service is wonderful too.

The only thing I didn't like was that the host didn't walk me all the way to the table and my friends had to wave me down.. Other than that the food was delicious.. Will definitely be coming back but only for appetizers drinks,desserts and Kevin lol , main courses weren't all that."

Daniel G.,/user_details?userid=nZXVR2QCRZ0D8-kxlqU-DA,"Williamsburg, NY",3/31/2013,5,"I've been here so many times I have lost count. Expensive but the food is worth every penny. The appetizer alone can be enough to fill you up. My favorite dish that I always order: deviled tuna tartare (yummy); boneless spare ribs (to die for); sweet & crispy jumbo shrimp (unbelievable delicious-insane!); charred asparagus (crunchy perfection); lobster fried rice or crab sticky rice (wow, I just can't take it!) For dessert i love the bread pudding...And there upu have it"

There are so many enticing menu items and I am sure that they are all amazing. But make sure you try those edamame dumplings - they are heavenly. You can really mix it up here and try a lot so make sure you go with people who like a diverse range of food so you can take advantage of the selection. Save room for dessert - there are many! I was impressed by the carrot cake - not my usual dessert choice but so glad I tried it."

Marie E.,/user_details?userid=OHQ7pUYZskL2naePg7H_Zg,"Secaucus, NJ",7/11/2013,4,"Great trendy restaurant, fun vibe, good crowded bar.  Been here a few times and the ambiance is the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Buddakan.  The front bar gets really packed. You'll probably have to wait there, even if you have reservations, so it's not too bad. We've usually been able to find a table, making the wait a lot more enjoyable. The restaurant is massive with extremely high ceilings and Asian-esque decor, dimly lit and overall a really cool place.  Food wasn't as memorable - not bad, just nothing to rave about.  The scallion pancakes were our favorite part of dinner, so definitely have those as an appetizer. All dishes are teeny weeny so you'll have to order a bunch of stuff to get pretty full. Great place for a date night or just a night out on the town."
Scott H.,/user_details?userid=B7wbZOogh9FbxLv-hK2I4A,"San Francisco, CA",6/2/2013,4,"Pricy and Sceney.  But oh so fun!  I hadn't been here in years and wondered if it had lost its luster.  It hadn't!  It was such a blast.  We didn't have a reso, so we sat at the bar and had such fun people watching.  We figured out the story of the couple across from us.  Poor things, I think they were about to get a divorce.  But everyone else was awesome and festive.   Excellent food and cocktails.  Love the substance and style, which doesn't happen all the time.  I'll be back, maybe for my birthday if I'm lucky."
Boris O.,/user_details?userid=0RQXewqLGsA6rxUOaB5Pjw,"Brooklyn, NY",1/16/2016,3,"I have been to Buddakan on three separate occasions and haven been to the AC location as well.  The food is very tasty and atmosphere is great.  However on my last visit with my family we opted for the tasting Manu and the portions were very small.  We have eaten the tasting Manu at the AC location and it has nearly double the food.  It's not the verity of dishes but the small plates and the quantity of plates. We had 11 people and received 2 small plates of each dish. For dessert we received one plate of each dish. We enjoyed ourselves, but left hungry."
Marie A.,/user_details?userid=z_EMxjVJf3ZKw_NIqFR0-A,"New York, NY",12/18/2011,3,This was the first restaurant I dined at upon my arrival in NYC! It's where Carrie Bradshaw had her engagement party so it was more of a novelty than anything ... The decor is amazing! The bar at the front is dark and would b a great place to go on a date (maybe next time ;)) to start the night was a delicious cocktail we then ordered a degustation meal in hindsight it was to greedy as we could hardly move after it was finished. The desserts and cocktails was the highlight! Fried rice was a sell.
Mie K.,/user_details?userid=T-wGap--9Pj_wEBbiNt-Pw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/19/2016,2,Nothing special. Food was over priced for the quality. Go to Chinatown for better cheaper food. If you want the experience... I guess it's ok...

I don't usually eat Chinese/Asian fusion/ (whatever you call it) because I like home cooked style village traditional Chinese food. But my friend wanted to go so we went, I ordered the crab with rice, which was surprisingly very good. It was a pretty good portion. I couldn't finish it, so I took it home and my son had the left over and loved it. I would recommend it and will also be returning."

Collin C.,/user_details?userid=LkWZV5Tg08oQLXTNuTc1pw,"Upper Marlboro, MD",5/26/2016,5,"By far one of my best dinning I've ever had. Only lapse side would be the noise level on the upper deck, would drive you insane. My suggestion is to make reservation up front and request being seated downstairs."
Wilson C.,/user_details?userid=iZRK9SJwoGx1DrZEFP0EHg,"Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",10/30/2013,3,"Although Asian fusion is not on the top of my favorite cuisines, I wanted to check out Buddakan.  Impressed by the decor and what was done with the place itself however not my favorite type of dinning atmosphere.  The seats on our table were very comfortable, so much that it s the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of last night's experience.  The food and service were very good. Had several appetizers to share, all matched up my expectations.  The Cod and the lemon chicken for entrees is what I would recommend."

The hostesses are slightly on the snobby side, but hey, I probably would be too if I was cool enough to work there. I found it amusing though when I asked if our table was ready for our 10:15 reservation, and the hostess, highly annoyed, replied, ""It's 10:11. Your reservation is at 10:15"". My only advice is don't ask and wait patiently in the bar!"

I went here over the weekend, with a friend and everything was top notch.  I had to wait a little bit, for my reservation, but considering how busy they were I was happy to get seated when I did."
Megan A.,/user_details?userid=IWcT85rkpXpg4JkVk8E0yQ,"Hermosa Beach, CA",2/13/2011,1,"This review is from my experience in Feb 2010.  Our waiter Pat was AWFUL.  We arrived on time for our 7pm reservation for a very special occasion.  Pat was very pushy and rude and commanded that we order our appetizers and entrees at the same time so he could turn our table for the next reservation...at this time there were only a few other tables seated in the whole house. We called the manager over and he was not receptive or apologetic. My friend's mom has never not tipped a server, but there was no way she was tipping this fat guy Pat on her BlackCard. The decor is awesome, the food was alright, but the staff at this place is so stuck-up and rude."

Dee M.,/user_details?userid=r8lz_trKO4qfwAjsjRf3Xg,"New York, NY",1/9/2012,4,"Buddakan is HUGE, dark (not in a weird way) and sexy! This is a great spot for a date or a night out with the girls. Reservations are a must any day of the week. The food is great and flavorful! I went out on a limb and even tried the Frog legs most recently! Please live a little and give it a try. I don't think you can go wrong with any dish here, thumbs up for Buddakan!"
Emily B.,/user_details?userid=oHSk4iIHHrEdOXm4KyfrQw,"Los Angeles, CA",1/23/2012,4,I had my CNY dinner with my friends here. We like the food.  The service was good. The only thing that I am not a big fan is the lighting. It is a bit dark for a Chinese Asian Fusion restaurant.
Richard M.,/user_details?userid=731WxTgmE6GZEKufVbexYA,"Manhattan, NY",10/21/2013,2,"The restaurant is very large and impressive. The food was not very impressive. It was over run with tourists, the music was very odd - one track was a lady screaming, the food was just ok."
Mary R.,/user_details?userid=391zq33UrGRN1AlXwd4iig,"Brooklyn, NY",7/3/2016,2,"This place lacks real ambience too cavernous and the food leaves a lot to be desired.The oxtail dumplings were served lukewarm, very gamey totally not edible, in fact all the food was served lukevwarm bordering on cold which totally contradicts their policy that the food iwhen served is brought to the table as soon as it is ready.This concept creates a scenario whereby you are sitting with one entree while your partner's entree and the side dish is served 10 minutes later making for a confusing and disjointed dinner experience. I do not recommend dinner here because of the lack luster presentations and the food which lack flavor.The deserts, Hong Kong doughnuts were tasteless and tasted like fried dough dipped in lots of sugar the Almondine Bread Pudding was a sloppy mush with no flavor."
Amanda T.,/user_details?userid=SckKccgLWQmku8Xp5iaA-w,"San Francisco, CA",1/29/2008,4,"Very beautiful inside!  My favorites were the edamame dumplings and the tea-smoked chicken!!  Yummmmmm!  I loved the Charm prosecco cocktail as well.  Portions are somewhat smaller than I was expecting for family style, but we all were full after our meal!  Definitely check it out!"

The restaurant was beautiful, the food was good, however the waiter CoreyT left us with a bad taste in our mouth.

Debrin S.,/user_details?userid=XbX53DUWFAzzc0BqS9BdyQ,"Southport, CT",10/1/2010,4,"If u didn't like it - then maybe u don't get it- I luv it! Sure- it was Fashion Week & the lounge was packed (on a Tuesday nite) and it was wall to wall beautiful people speaking a plethora of international languages but it was still fabulous- people watching was at it's optimum (OH the shoes!)! Its gorgeous inside- dark Asian/old world Oriental w strong Colonial Western architectural flavor. The view above the communal long dining table beneath the ornate chandelier/candelabra is stunning. The service (despite the crowds) was excellent. We had a variety of cocktails/small plates which were excellent in presentation, flavor & quality: Tuna Tartare Spring Rolls, Boneless Spare Ribs, Lobster Egg Rolls, & Hoisin Glazed Pork Belly (friends said was ""ridiculous""). Cocktails: Fever (spicy - my fave), Charm (sweeter than anticipated) & Lush. A great place to bring out of town friends for a WOW factor."
David C.,/user_details?userid=OgMgne9LJznZeeUAxucqUw,"Temple City, CA",3/29/2012,5,"My wife was not as impressed as I was, but I thought the food was amazing.  That being said, holy hit was it pricey.  A pal told me it was pricey before I got there, but spending this much money... it was more than Morimoto (and he's an Iron Chef).  Then again, I did like the food here even more.  Friendly polite staff.  Nothing snobby.  Beautiful decor.  Good saketinis (my Asian food drink of choice).  Had a bunch of food.  First the lobster egg rolls (very good) and the General tso's dumplings.  These were good but probably not worth the price as they were good soup dumplings you could get anywhere in Chinatown.  The scallion pancakes with short rib were good, but also would probably not order again, only because short rib always overpowers everything else - it tastes like a Jewish brisket and I can make it just as good at home.  The chilli rock shrimp on the other hand were fantastic.   Nice bit of spice to an otherwise common appetizer, so it set it apart.  Finished with the broken chili chicken which was delicious.  Make sure to really rub it in the sauce.  And also the lobster fried rice which is stupendous.  All in all a fantastic meal, but once again, unless you're really rich, you're gonna need to save your pennies.  This is the kind of place that the main character and his buddies in ""American Psycho"" would be dying to go to."
Esther T.,/user_details?userid=9TLh-OPbwNQnYIeXPWtvDw,"New York, NY",6/6/2012,4,"Came here for my birthday last month. I've only been to Buddakan in AC, so didn't really know what to expect since the menu is different. I was fiending for the edamame dumplings (though it is edamame ravioli in AC) and the crispy calamari salad. We ordered those two items for appetizers, Alaskan cod and rock shrimp for entrees. Needless to say the portions were tiny. Portions in AC are huge btw. We were very happy with the appetizers. They were close to AC, but AC does it better. In AC not only is the portion bigger, there's crispy calamari in almost every bite of salad. Here the calamari was only half crispy and scarce. I prefer the edamame ravioli over the dumplings. Nonetheless still good to feed the craving till I get back to AC. The entrees were good. My cod wasn't really special. Like the sea bass in AC way better. Dessert I got the crying chocolate, and fiancee got something with panna cotta. Both were great. Loved the jasmine ice cream. If you've never been to AC, this would be better. But AC really is better than here. Not to mention they do have lychee martini which is the best drink ever!"
Danan R.,/user_details?userid=ouODopBKF3AqfCkuQEnrDg,"New York, NY",3/29/2013,5,"I love this Stephen Starr restaurant, and it is even better than the Philly version.  The steamed sea bass roll is a fantastic app with fragrant scallion oil, and the deviled tuna tartare is the perfect combination of spicy and creamy flavors.  The dungeness crab sticky rice is very solid, although it's not quite as great as Joe's.  The mongolian lamb chops, however, are fantastic, as is the glazed Alaskan cod; the cod flesh is incredibly silky and tender and lamb is tender and flavorful.  Be sure to get the Chinese sausage fried rice with the sunny side-up egg!  There are plenty of options for vegetarians, too, although I personally love the hoisin-glazed pork belly.  It's hard to go wrong with any dish here.  For dessert, I always head straight for the Almond bread oudding with whiskey ice cream and bananas.  It's creamy and has just the perfect hint of alcohol.  Service is always super and you can't beat the hip, upbeat, trendy atmosphere.  Prices are also very reasonable for the ambiance and quality!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!"
Anand M.,/user_details?userid=xdBNNHeazNddcub5N673dg,"Manhattan, NY",3/19/2015,5,"I have been going here since it opened a decade ago.  Amazing food, service and decor. The filet of beef with mustard sauce is one of the best dishes I have ever had. Appetizers are awesome as well."

Every single thing we ordered was amazing. People say this is an expensive spot. But idk, either I am richer than most or they are cheap. This place is NOT expensive and I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu. When my dessert came it had a candle and said ""happy anniversary"" on it. :) that added a nice touch.

For main entree I had the charred filet which was the best beef I've ever had not prepared by a french chef. Buttery and melted in my mouth. The kung pao monkfish was excellent as well.

Pomme L.,/user_details?userid=T--kmK-eyPf_vLGZQ-0aJQ,"Garden Grove, CA",6/17/2013,2,"This place is definitely over rated, probably because it was on some television show in the past.  Anyway to be fair I think that it is some kind of fusion place, because all the Eastern dishes it have must have been toned down for the delicate Anglo taste bud.  It had none of the explosion of flavors as you would get from tasting an Asian cuisine.  Also the size of the dish is very small as expected in any high end place.  My whole Peking duck look like a quail, and it didn't taste anything like you would hope a Peking Duck would.  If you eat with eyes then this place is not bad, if you eat with you taste buds I suggest you head down to Chinatown."

I love how there was a bar in the entrance, then you had to walk downstairs for the main dining room. I think it would be perfect for a wedding rehearsal dinner! Nothing says, ""I HAVE ARRIVED"", like walking slowly down the stairs where everyone can see you! The food served during the party was delicious. Some of the stations there were from the chefs who work at Buddakan and all I remember was everything being delicious! I will definitely be back for dinner."

Not a bad location but not necessarily near everything else in Manhattan which actually makes for a slightly less crowded atmosphere which is good. A bit pricey but the food is rather good. Quite a bit like Tao without all the over-the-top taste and ambiance. Almost like Tao-light, including the service. The bar can be a bit cramped but if you're lucky you'll be able to get a small table nearby. Nothing to really complain about but by going to Tao more times like we do you'll find this place is a little lacking in the wow-factor. All-in-all it stands good on its own and is a good alternative when you want a less flashy and more relaxed but still top-rate dining experience."

It's expensive, and really not that tasty. I've had much better 15 dollar Asian meals from takeout. I think you are paying for the atmosphere here, which is lovely...but I prefer my food to be amazing. I had the black pepper ribeye, which was average. I also had the lobster fried rice, which was on the bland side, and the shrimp dumplings were unmemorable, as well. I doubt I'll go back."

The crying chocolate dessert was especially enjoyable. However, it is in the meatpacking district and was featured in the Sex and the City movie (please don't ask me how I know that. ok, so I watched it on demand, i'm reluctant to admit...)--SO, expect a fairly large percentage of the crowd to be Bridge & Tunnel. If you bring your own company and stick with them, it can be a good time. Great service, for sure. Had a friend's birthday party here and they were very accommodating!"

It's expensive but you have GOT TO try it. Even though we had 10pm reservations which were made a month! in advance, we had to wait 45 minutes to get the main dining room, which is trust me, where you want to have this fantastic dining experience, so it is a very POPULAR place and for the right reasons."
Bridget K.,/user_details?userid=4U8PeqcDO3G50BJ9QKMLUw,"Evansville, IN",5/11/2010,4,"My friend and I went here for drinks and appetizers a while back.  We just stumbled upon it as we were walking down 9th ave.  The decor is beautiful.  Love the inside of the restaurant.  The cocktails are delicious.  The appetizer I had was quite tasty, some sort of brisket thing.  Great place."
Michelle E.,/user_details?userid=v_gdWkUoAOvgB29WYbaC2w,"Westchester County, NY",4/25/2011,5,I had been so excited to try this place for my birthday celebration. We were all first timers and really impressed with the quality and presentation of the food for such a large restaurant. Everyone from the check-in desk to our server was warm and cordial. The appetizers were so delicious and so were the entrees. We left there very satisfied and paid a lot less than expected considering its location. Drinks were also well-made and enough for the money. On our way home we were already planning our next night there!
Ruth K.,/user_details?userid=BquCQH35BwhmKoegkEzC1Q,"Los Angeles, CA",7/24/2011,4,"Their drinks are exorbitantly overpriced, but their service and decor really make up for it. The crowd is pretty mixed. I cant complain, I met some pretty chill people here."
Jimena V.,/user_details?userid=8UtrweZyBofhhTkJkgFqrQ,"Astoria, NY",8/31/2011,5,"LOVE this place! decor is amazing, staff is great and attentive and the food is amazing! omg you have to try the edamame dumplings! all the food was amazing! it gets a little loud but it doesn't matter- the food makes up for it! great place for dinner if you're going to party that night!"
Daisy K.,/user_details?userid=BgQsnXFOUJol3G35bf9oGA,"New York, NY",2/14/2012,5,I really love this place. Been here four times and never have been disappointed. I love the tuna tartare spring rolls. The black cod was amazing. We also ordered the dungeness crab with sticky rice which was a bit on the salty side. I got the  Crying Chocolate for dessert and the jasmine ice cream was so delicious. The service was top notch. One of my fav restaurants.
Julio M.,/user_details?userid=aJeOUOgap0p0v36Q3vFB5w,"Miami Lakes, FL",2/2/2013,4,"Reservations are a Must as they are always crowded.  The dark lighting makes for a very relaxing setting, though. Decor is beautiful. Prices are not cheap but are reasonable for NYC. Only thing I did not like was the edamame dumplings. I love edamame but these dumplings had a very odd and unsavory taste. The Chinese sausage fried rice with sunny side up egg and lobster fried rice were both great as was chili rock shrimp appetizer.  Wait staff was professional, knowledgable and efficient. Put it on ur list when in NYC."
Tina K.,/user_details?userid=2OLYtOMhPyGvieyluzgtQA,"Charlotte, NC",2/7/2013,5,"Love me some Buddakan!  Decor is gorgeous and the food, staff, and drinks are perfect.  Been here several times and am never dissapointed."
Alex H.,/user_details?userid=U1BSlJfJaXS20N9JqkEcDg,"Los Angeles, CA",8/31/2013,5,"This place is in my top 5 restaurants of all time. Flavors are balanced and complex.

Alicia M.,/user_details?userid=jFwqPERMN_7FbboEd3TSZQ,"Seaford, NY",5/27/2013,5,Went here for dinner on a thurs night and enjoyed the atmosphere . When you walk in you don't realize just how big the place is till your seated downstairs where there's a beautiful dinning area with very high ceilings. The staff was perfect and attentive and the food was amazing.

Cate O.,/user_details?userid=HN4Dz2L8bePaf8cdEm9uxg,"Denver, CO",10/16/2013,5,"Pricey place to go, but worth every penny! Food was melt in your mouth good, cocktails amazing, and how do you not feel like you are sitting in an episode of Sex in the City? The decor was absolutely breath taking with a grand staircase that takes you to your table. We sat in the library which was a little tucked away from the rest of the restaurant, but I loved that because the music was a little loud in the bar. But, that might just be because I'm in my mid-30s. If you hit Manhattan, hit this place. But, you'll have to get a rez!"
Michael D.,/user_details?userid=lwnVCL1UTqqxc6TC8n2Jtg,"Dallas, TX",7/21/2007,5,"Incredible design, space, and arrangement. I came here for a work related event and sampled a large selection of their food and drinks - it's all top notch. Great achievement."
Jeanne E.,/user_details?userid=FBQ8aB_55GqvtaROAzU4Ww,"Brooklyn, NY",6/18/2008,4,"Buddakan is enormous and the chandelier-adorned space is strikingly gorgeous.  Our server was attentive without being overbearing and gave thoughtful answers to our questions about the menu.  The tuna tartare spring roll and edamame dumplings were amazing and coconut foam transformed the vegetable fried rice from what would otherwise be an unremarkable dish into a culinary standout.  I'm undecided as to whether Buddakan trumps Tao, my longstanding Pan-Asian favorite, but it is certainly in the running."
Lindsey S.,/user_details?userid=Ee1X166FarLrxH_u8pLcJA,"Brooklyn, NY",1/31/2009,5,Go with a group and be prepared to spend at least 100-150 a head. Be sure to order the edamame dumplings and the lamb. So delicious.

The host/hostess didn't seem like they had a clue of what was going on. First they said it was going to be 45 mins so we sat at a table over at the bar. 10 minutes later, after we just got our drinks, the host came over and said they had a table ready for us. I remember ordering the tuna spring roll and that was like a firecracker exposion in my mouth. The flavors were so delicious and I love the texture of the soft tuna and the crispy roll. We ordered seconds! All the other dishes were about average. I want to go back just for the tuna spring rolls."
Shweta V.,/user_details?userid=2nn7CyYHUPbK-Op8bO3iDA,"San Francisco, CA",9/21/2009,4,"Good food - I went with a large group and as a result, was able to try several items on the menu. Noteworthy items were edamame dumplings, kung pao monkfish, and Charm cocktail. Great ambience -what else can you expect from a restaurant featured in a SATC rehearsal dinner?"
Sara Z.,/user_details?userid=p6VebTE1GMQxFs9NAjqahg,"Bethesda, MD",6/11/2010,5,"I have been here about 5 times, and never been disappointed. The edamame dumplings are amazing.   Everything I have ordered here is great.  They have a drink called 'fever' - it has jalapeno in it...how much better than that can you get?

Carolina G.,/user_details?userid=hQFV5J7Wc3OQgj0atm2LiQ,"Elmwood Park, NJ",6/24/2010,5,"Beautifulllllllllll restaurant, one of the few that have taken my breath away with the decor. Service very fast and attentive. Do not recall the specific plates we had it was a party of 10 and they ordered many plates for us, but I must say every dish I tried was amazing! I definitely recommend it whether it's for a birthday, date, etc."
Cristina B.,/user_details?userid=kS9RPgaapi27mDXec_BbOg,"New York, NY",6/30/2010,5,I went over a year ago and still remember the food. Everything was absolutely delicious. The restaurant is BIG and is decorated beautifully.
Diana T.,/user_details?userid=TWAAUIoh0pFXzsLR3vk-cg,"Boston, MA",7/11/2010,5,"Certain foods are nonetheless orgasmic in life. Buddakan has to be doing that to men and women every single night! Their asian fusion fare tasted authentically refreshing. I had the edamame dumplings, chili lump crab meat over longevity noodles, hong kong style ribeye steak with turnip fries, and lobster fried rice. Yep! I reached that big O. Not only was the food awesome, the service was great too. Plus, you get to sit in a restaurant with great ambience and gorgeous decor. I would LOVE to come back and try more deliciousness. Who cares how much it costs right???"

Erin K.,/user_details?userid=zttQ6NHvirrsLeXl8n6dwg,"Dublin, OH",5/2/2011,4,"Really great atosphere although super crowded.  Our waitress was very friendly and made excellent recommendations. We had the edamame dumpling, veggie dumpling, general tso dumpling and calamari salad for appitzers; all were outstanding but the edamame stood out above the rest. We also had the filet, monkfish, scallaps and a tofu dish for dinner. Again everything was fantastic. For dessert the chocolate peanut butter bomb was delicious.  We didn't think the noise level was bad but I did ask for a more inimate table. Overall I would highly recommend and would definitely come back."

Tom H.,/user_details?userid=uLn1kpcjPCATkZQoisDInQ,"Boerum Hill, NY",10/21/2011,5,"Ok, my prior review was bare bones.  I've been back a number of times and went again last night and needed to pipe in again.  Edamame dumplings.  Edamame dumpings.  Edamame dumplings.  Are unbelievable.  5 to an order, whipped edamame and some truffle oil in a light dumpling.  Absolutely delicious.  One of my favorite things to eat, right up there with the slab bacon at Luger's.  And the wait staff and service for such a high end ""hip"" place is pretty excellent as well."
Alex C.,/user_details?userid=WfjA3DENSJ0aQD2HMOm54w,"Washington, DC",12/6/2011,5,"Super classy, great food. Long waits for walk-ins, so def make a reservation, and I think the bar is overpriced but I don't usually associate booze and Asian food anyway. Would definitely recommend the Wild Mushroom Chow Fun."
Tasha I.,/user_details?userid=bNAXVgsZ-BXqov9pAmyTww,"Los Angeles, CA",12/31/2012,4,"Recently dined at Buddakan during a trip to NYC. First of all, the restaurant is HUGE and has a wonderful ambiance. When we first arrived, we enjoyed a few cocktails in the bar area while we waiting for our table. I highly recommend the ""Charm!"" Once seated, we ordered several dishes that were very, very good. The tuna tartare spring rolls and the lobster fried rice were standouts. When in NYC again, I would definitely come back!"
Lauren E.,/user_details?userid=T-fcCbuBg0SRyvDUxfKsAQ,"Chicago, IL",2/24/2013,3,"I knew what I was getting into at a place like Buddakan.  Meat packing, great atmosphere, creative drinks.  But, I was underwhelmed by Buddakan.  The food was nothing special.  The only dish we had that I really loved was the oysters.  And, our waiter made really bad suggestions.  All the dishes we ordered based on his recommendation were bad and the things we ordered despite not getting his stamp of approval were good.  The food was fine, but I was expecting something better.  I really wanted to love it!  I've been to a lot of Asian fusion places and Buddakan was definitely not the best.  I would go back for a sceney night and good drinks, but the food is definitely not its biggest selling point."
Heather W.,/user_details?userid=sOIRB5oaXang6B-J_njeNg,"Denver, CO",3/30/2013,5,Amazing meal from start to finish...highlights were pork buns and scallops. Service was great. Ask for seat along edge of second floor - great views.

It is a little overpriced for what it is, but that said, they have actually put some thought into their recipes.  We got Udon noodles and some cod,and both were really good. If you can deal with the mix of douche bags and star-struck  tourists you will inevitably have to share your space with, you will likely enjoy your meal."

Nicole A.,/user_details?userid=MusJ-r0vkPXCTN4FqZ5LMw,"JAMAICA, NY",9/9/2014,5,"This is one of my favorite places to go for a night out. It's great for group outings but also for an intimate evening. I haven't had one thing here that I didn't completely enjoy. The service is always impeccable and the staff knows a lot about the menu and is very helpful in providing suggestions. The ambiance is great - every room has a different appeal. I also didn't realize how much space the restaurant actually has (every time I've been there, I've sat in a different location). I think the only downside to the restaurant is that you can't be seated until you're entire party arrives (not great if you travel with late people). The bar space is large and on a weekday there's plenty of room (weekends are a lot more populated however, I've never seen this place truly empty). Menu favorites are the boneless ribs and crispy honey shrimp but again - everything there is quite delicious. What's also great about this restaurant is that you can order tons of appetizers and still feel full. Also, all the menu items are made for sharing. One of the best restaurants you could go to when looking for Asian fusion and an overall excellent dining experience."

Mike T.,/user_details?userid=qhlO5oEiPvvQ5o_uYrr73A,"New York, NY",2/5/2008,4,"Went here for my birthday dinner. We started out with the edamame dumplings, Peking duck spring rolls and spare rib pancakes. The dumplings and spring rolls were delicious. The pancakes were fine but I might have preferred them without the spare ribs. For our entrees we each had the fillet which was cooked near to perfection, (I especially loved the ginger sauce they served it with.) To top things off, I enjoyed a complimentary chocolate lava cake, while my friends order a sorbet and some sort of dish with banana and garnish. Everything about the meal was wonderful. After a couple glasses of wine, we got ready to head out for the night. Would definitely recommend for a return visit, as both service and food were quite impressive."

Derek S.,/user_details?userid=x-54Gym3nQgHWESJESasEw,"San Francisco, CA",7/23/2009,3,"It was fun.  In comparison to Tao, where I've been to quite a few times, I have to say I had more fun here.  The decor isn't so Pacific tacky as Tao is.  In fact, it's quite the opposite.  Pictures on the wall have nothing to do with Eastern culture at times and actually spark interesting conversation instead leaving you thinking you've stepped into a bland pot of coffee like the other place.  It's dark and frankly you can't see much around you past 20 feet, but there's still an expansive sense of warmth all around you.  If you can, get seated downstairs.  If you're stuck upstairs near the bar, you're gonna have only the view of the more open downstairs and the view of buzzed people waiting by the bar for their tables.  We had a large group, and while we had to wait a while despite reservations (about 30-45 minutes,) it was worth it (but not well worth it.)  The dinner was interesting, imaginative, and fun (that's the 2nd time I've said it.)  Our waiter was helpful and funny.   It's very expensive for similar (or even better) tasting food prepared at more authentic Asian food places, given the fact that you can't really change standards like spring rolls, potstickers, general tso's, steamed sole, etc, and they don't even have some of the highly sought after Chinese dishes not popular among casual Chinese food diners.  The one saving grace are the desserts, which aren't necessarily anywhere close to authentic for Chinese food, but are more western in inspiration."

The bartenders are great and the food is even better. The crab sticky rice was soo good. The best sticky rice I've had and I've had plenty. The atmosphere was even better and like many other reviewers, there is a great reason why they filmed here in SATC. The edamame dumplings are to die for. They are extremely different and you'll have no idea what the explosion of flavor will be like. Very busy, make reservations ahead of time."
M M.,/user_details?userid=-JFUU0TjHxt1aFLPD4uK9Q,"Santa Clara, CA",8/23/2010,5,MMMMM this place was well worth it and so delicious! We ordered the BBQ spare ribs and lobster fried rice. Both were mouthwatering and super tasty. They definitely hit the spot! Cocktails were also very good. The restaurant is two stories and simply amazing. Seems like a fun place to have a big dinner because of the big communal table on the bottom floor(where SATC 1 was filmed also)! Our server was also very accommodating- we will surely return! Rezzies a must!!

I wonder if they would deliver to SF??"
Eva S.,/user_details?userid=n6wkuZprN84t6R8_qMGtdg,"Boca Raton, FL",5/24/2011,4,"Talk about one of those truely unique kind of restaurants. The design of this place is just awesome. When we first arrived I was a little disappointed to find out we still had to wait 30min for our table despite having reservations for 11:00pm!! But I quickly forgot about the delay as soon as I ordered my martini at the bar area...I had the Lush which was amazing!!! So finally we got seated but again had to wait quite some time before our waitor came to greet us. For apps were ordered the tuna tartare, the jade shrimp dumplings, and the yellowtail yu sheng. The tuna tartare was by far my favorite, you absolutely must try it. Just a warning though all the apps are teeny tiny, so definitely order more than one! For my meal I had the black pepper beef, which was good but not nearly as good as the appetizers. We also shared the lobster fried rice...do yourself a favor and order the lobster fried rice, its the best! The only reason I did not give this place the full 5 stars is because our waitor seemed grouchy. If I am paying this much for a dinner the least you can do is fake a smile!"
Shaun A.,/user_details?userid=nfSCAPBh1IoEznoJZrprWA,"Austin, TX",6/16/2011,4,"Beautiful decor! The food is pretty good, highlights were the edamame dumplings, chili rock shrimp, and roasted pork. Great get together spot!"

Alan G.,/user_details?userid=DF0X9OLXmoBqhgFECyWYOg,"Rockville, MD",7/26/2011,5,"Outstanding atmosphere, drinks and food.  The asian ribs rocked, seabass outstanding. Everything tasty enough to make your head explode.  Our waiter was snooty, but that's probably the norm in a restaurant such as this. My reviews are on food alone.  In and out quickly - huge place."
Matt Z.,/user_details?userid=--_nP6G2mAHyrEFtIG6ggw,"Chicago, IL",8/14/2011,5,AMAZING! Everything was delicious. The Edamame dumplings are out of this world. The Crispy chicken and the chilean sea bass. It was AMAZING

Everything we ordered was amazing and so flavourful. Our waiter (sadly can't remember his name) made the evening even better! He told us he's been there since their opening days, very informative about menu from apps to drinks. He was a doll!"

I'm a bid DIM SUM fan and Buddakan gets very creative with theirs. try the Edamame DIM SUM, and the its fantastic! Next time I'm in NYC i will def. go back!"
Fran H.,/user_details?userid=uaWOTLRpeLad2CJ3PNOvbA,"South Plainfield, NJ",3/31/2012,5,"Wonderful dinner, started with a cocktail called Charm...was outstanding and had the freshest berries.  We had both the General Tso's and Pork Dumplings.  General Tso's was outstanding, the pork dumplings were not have the same caliber but the hot chili sauce added a great kick.  We had the monkfish and filet entrees.  Both were outstanding.  The sauce with the filet was perfect and the filet was like butter.  The monkfish was flavorful, light and cooked to perfection.  Had the mushroom noodles on the side which were good but would not order again, would prefer to try the Lobster Fried Rice.  Great drink selection, they even had Grappa for my husband as his dessert choice!  Would go back in a heartbeat."

Lorraine R.,/user_details?userid=dT_j5wuXXf1G8BjGz4FncQ,"Rochelle Park, NJ",8/12/2012,5,"Edamame dumplings, filet with magic sauce, lobster rolls, delish!!  And on-street parking. Perfect."
Lady D.,/user_details?userid=H2fzgNHL3oWWMuw9-Na97g,"Elizabeth, NJ",8/13/2012,5,"So I went to Buddakan with a group of 12 girls to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Since our party was over 10 people, the restaurant required a pre-fix menu.  Well, I must say that the food kept coming out and every dish was better than the last.  I thoroughly enjoyed this meal.  The restaurant was super trendy and great for people watching.  All of the girls in my group raved about the food as well.  I will definitely be heading back here."
Michael B.,/user_details?userid=0u-rOQfCgtBQlK2iDie03Q,"Boynton Beach, FL",9/7/2012,5,"My favorite NYC restaurant. My wife and went last Saturday, and had a great experience. Food and service were outstanding."
Katie J.,/user_details?userid=FqsNlZPZ-cL5je1qWjuKxQ,"Austin, TX",10/22/2012,5,"Amazing place for a birthday celebration, we just loved it. Impeccable service. Everyone was so nice, and I was shocked considering it is so easy to be the opposite of that if you work at a trendy restaurant. The food was fantastic, and we were not looking for super authentic asian-style cuisine, we were looking for the whole package of a superb time and had just that at Buddakan."
Barton T.,/user_details?userid=_S0CnuqCKD5gCT-M6-fGGA,"Chicago, IL",12/18/2012,5,"Loved my experience here. No reservations, but was able to snag seats in the bar area. Full menu is available, which was a plus. The General Tso Chicken Dumplings were awesome and dangerous. You can't eat just one. Caution-the sauce will come out of the dumpling when you bite into it. I also had the dungeon crab sticky rice, which knocked me out of my seat. A flavorful and simple dish. The scene is cool-a mix of hip, flair and chill. Would recommend this place without pause."
Leah B.,/user_details?userid=WdbqG4XFN3iMn4uwEI76eA,"San Francisco, CA",5/17/2013,4,"Wow, we're from San Francisco, and Buddakan was like SF's new Hakkasan on steroids. Such amazing real estate! We asked to be seated downstairs, in the area of the big communal table. This gave us a birds-eye view of everyone coming down the staircase. We deferred to our waitress, and the selections were awesome. And the bill was definitely reasonable, by NYC standards."
Engin B.,/user_details?userid=PsYt6c4QYHsEJ6JGp_dsMw,"Toronto, Canada",11/11/2013,5,From the beginning till the end everything was perfect 5 star service excellent food beautiful ambiance this place is a must Thanks for this great experience

Daniel C.,/user_details?userid=9P0UtlMsZU5leUDLwWpYRg,"Trenton, NJ",11/9/2013,4,"Arrived here at 6pm on a Saturday night with my wife and another couple.  We did not make a reservation beforehand and they were full according to the hostess but we were able to put a couple of small tables together in the lounge where the entire menu is available and were seated immediately.  Our server was quick, efficient and knowledgable.  We had lobster fried rice, hoisin glazed pork belly, scallion pancakes and Kung Pao monkfish.  All of our dishes were tasty but the scallion pancakes wouldn't be ordered again if we went back.  Overall good service, tasty food and a very nice interior.  I would definitely go back and also recommend to others."
Sandra B.,/user_details?userid=UEUgClTZChIi1mLLNoOHig,"Edison, NJ",1/25/2014,5,I never have any complaints I adore this place with a passion. Great date spot if you want to impress someone. Atmosphere is amazing. Love love love

To makes things worse, my phone iphone 5, it wasn t some cheap phone.... was stolen in the restaurant .... The manager was rude and obnoxious, wouldn't call the police, ""you can call the police!""

Mich L.,/user_details?userid=w2rQz5Di44V-XFR8PMM9VA,"Brooklyn, NY",3/24/2015,3,"The ambiance is AWESOME but the food is whatever. If you are from out of town and looking for good food, this isn't a place I'd recommend. But if you are coming here to say you ate at Buddakan - order the Alaskan Black Cod, Dan Dan Nodles, Tuna Tartare Spring Roll, Chili Rock Shrimp, the Mongolian Lambchops and the Sizzling Short Ribs."
Leon G.,/user_details?userid=Pw_EBnnCRBULDXuud5FSDA,"Manhattan, NY",11/6/2016,1,"The worst experience over ever had in my life. We had reservations for 11pm on a Saturday night. We got there on time and when I spoke to the hostess she said they will seat our party of 5 in a few minutes. She asked us to wait by the bar. After waiting 30 minutes I began to get annoyed and went back to the front and asked how much longer it would take to be seated, the hostesses gave a huge attitude and said their busy it will be a few more minutes. Finally at 11:46 we got seated. The person who seated us had a major attitude. The service then didn't get any better. It took forever to even use the bathroom. Such a large place and only two unisex bathrooms on the top floor. I had to wait 15 minutes just to be able to wash my hands!! The food was ok but nothing special.  I've go out to eat 10 times a week, and I've been to many restaurants in NYC. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had. I don't recommend anyone to eat here unless their willing to have a terrible time and be very annoyed. Never would I leave a bad review for any restaurant unless it was this bad."
Sophia J.,/user_details?userid=cY5sfmm0iU4dzHutibEuIQ,"New Brunswick, NJ",11/7/2014,4,"The food was great, but you have to schedule a reservation if you want to get a table.  Very pricey but the atmosphere was very fun."
Roy D.,/user_details?userid=rCHv7nYIMjoAbijZe6PuEg,"South Orange, NJ",1/9/2016,5,Love this place for the food and the ambiance. It's a real event. And delicious. And lots of fun!

Bissaa A.,/user_details?userid=ta1RgZfpMdQUl1TSodxHjQ,"New York, NY",10/10/2015,4,Went here for my husbands birthday. The service was excellent and the atmosphere great. We ordered a bunch of different plates for the table. Every dish was amazing!!
Courtney L.,/user_details?userid=dgreUxScmibShypYdB8yIA,"New York, NY",8/3/2013,3,"If you're looking for a place with an experience more than unbelievable food...this is your spot.  If you make reservations, don't expect to get your table right away.  We waited 45 minutes before we finally got our table but we didn't mind because we had great seats in the lounge and enjoyed drinks and appetizers to tie us over.  This place is HUGE.  I was surprised to find a place so big in NYC.  Food was good but doubt I would go back.  We had the edamame dumplings as everyone raves about them.  They were great.  The soft shell crab was terrible.  I would suggest the Sole for dinner.  It was by far the best entree of the three we ordered.  The whole experience lasted about 3 hours from the time we arrived to the time we left.  Be prepared to be there awhile.  Overall, it was a good experience."
Natasha W.,/user_details?userid=FykmLnIuh6oPaSPJ3RLB_A,"Manhattan, NY",5/31/2013,5,"Exquisite ambiance and food. One of the BEST restaurants in NYC and worth every penny.

Rachel T.,/user_details?userid=bj75fmPQgShpZkHcsAyZng,"Monte Nido, CA",1/20/2011,5,"Buddakan is my new favorite restaurant.  Everything I had here was mouth watering and delicious.  It was so good I wanted to keep eating even though I was full.  The staff was nice, the atmosphere was great (lofty artsy vibe), and the food was out of this world amazing.  I highly recommend it!"
Jenny S.,/user_details?userid=Wv7U2XVk55sQ6Mf2IhKWoQ,"Manhattan, NY",3/12/2011,4,"The food was delicious, but the portions were way huge. I think they would be better off making them smaller so people could taste more of the variety.  I think it was all a bit too salty as well (maybe msg), because I was drinking water like a crazy person the next day and so was my dinner companion.  Food good, aftereffects, not so perfect."
Sean S.,/user_details?userid=9jKU6oJZVU9IAgSda0gG2w,"Brooklyn, NY",5/2/2011,5,I went here 4 times already and this place never let's me down. The miso cod is amazing.

Christina B.,/user_details?userid=JA_XDtYCKIUTl6fZ8uVShQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/22/2011,4,"We have been here several times, and have always gobbled down each and every bite of our meal.  The edamame dumplings are SO good, I dream about their pillowy deliciousness.  We have never ordered anything off the menu and been disappointed.  The only thing that annoys me about this restaurant is the fact that they always make you wait twenty minutes after the time of your reservation to be seated (so you'll order drinks from the bar)."
Mcduff G.,/user_details?userid=IdgTn_4L5Vd8mVtHlzjy5w,"Brooklyn, NY",6/5/2011,4,Love the food. If you go try that whole fish.Tried it and loved it Also the atmosphere is great !! Def one of my favorite restaurants.

We tried a little too late to get a dinner reservation on a Saturday night but decided to go there any ways. We immediately found a seat in the cocktail lounge and decided to eat dinner there. The food was AMAZING!!! I can honestly say I think that it was the best food I've ever had!! Neither of us could stop eating! I had the lamb chops while my boyfriend had the filet. We ordered the chinese sausage rice and green beans on the side. The only thing that was bit annoying was our waitress was pushy. She kept asking us if we wanted another drink when we still had at least half of our current drink left. It also took a while for her to bring our drinks once we ordered them. Regardless of the flaw with the waitstaff, I definitely recommend this place for the food. SOO GOOD!"
Ray W.,/user_details?userid=KPac0N9IhHt-7T0F9kF7Ew,"Manhattan, NY",9/19/2011,3,"Ok food, very loud place, edamame dumplings are probably the best, and the wine is okay."
Mary Cecilia M.,/user_details?userid=WNar5geXh9MN9uhxLSG3Cw,"Manhattan, NY",12/12/2011,5,"I had already had quite a bit to drink by the time I got to my 11pm reservation at Buddakan, but I was still able to relish in the all of the great flavors. Three friends and I shared three fish entrees, lobster fried rice and some chicken dumplings. Everything. Was. Delicious. No complaints with the food. We had a bottle of Chardonnay, too. Now, I don't love Chardonnay, but it wasn't too buttery and actually complemented our meal quite well. I want to go back here! Oh, and the service was fabulous--our waitress couldn't have been more sweet and patient."
J R.,/user_details?userid=QfHinbP7IUlhtQVIWaMzvg,"New York, NY",12/28/2011,2,"Perhaps it was better when it first opened, but our recent experience was not great.  Below average food and uncomfortable dining."
Sapna N.,/user_details?userid=isRBvPXdVVJg9sAV_TZfKw,"Fremont, CA",2/14/2012,5,I think one of my favorite restaurants ever. I wanted to go there as soon as I saw the Sex and the City movie. It is where they filmed the rehearsal dinner for Carrie and Big. And the food was speculator. it is super dark in there and the hostesses have a hard time finding you to seat you. But it is very trendy and beautiful inside. The one thing that really stood out for me were the dumplings. I would definitely go back.

Cassie V.,/user_details?userid=8wcKW21Z3bFgiUJGRSZYsg,"Austin, TX",6/2/2012,5,"Spent my 40th birthday here and loved it. We all did. Good ambience, great drinks, great food, great service. I'm writing this review late so I cannot recall all that we ordered. But I know we loved the braised short ribs, the lump crab sticky rice, the scallops, the crying chocolate. Everything we ordered we really liked or LOVED! They have a drink called Fate, it's soo good. I now recreate it at home. If you are a super foodie, it may not be the best food in the world, but still very good. And combined with everything else, I can't wait to go back."

It's true, this place makes you feel like a million dollars in the most disgustingly satisfying way! Very cool interior with large majestic chandeliers. Good service. Food comes in small plates...order lots to share with the table. There is also a more loungy space with a bar and house music. Sexy, suave, sophisticated...check it out!"

Wilson V.,/user_details?userid=STGNAvsL0hxhADmH1HX7Wg,"Jacksonville, FL",1/23/2013,4,"Stopped by during a trip I took to New York. The outside looks like the entrance to a Rave. It didn't help that I was using Apple Maps either. Took a while to find. The environment was pretty formal. I wasn't dressed properly, and I got some stares for it. The food was excellent, I had the ginger crusted lamb as well as the coconut rice, and  sweet, spicy crab legs, as well as their chocolate desserts. It's been a while so the exact names have slipped my mind. I definitely recommend this place. Expect to pay upwards of $100 for two."
Jennifer A.,/user_details?userid=iVemzaUck4c-5aDx93C_-w,"Chino, CA",3/1/2013,2,"Not a fan of anything we ordered, which was the chili rock shrimp (tiny shrimp), hoison glazed pork belly, and fried rice. However, the atmosphere is awesome. I'd go here only for drinks."
Peggy C.,/user_details?userid=2Q-orfZwJGFtql5FHSJ6Iw,"Fairfax, VA",10/27/2014,5,"had my 40th birthday dinner there. Love the food (I had the pepper steak, ginger and scallion lobster, wok tossed noodles, alaskan cod, all excellent). I'm originally from Taiwan and I would say the food is just as good if not better than authentic chinese restaurants. of course, the decor is really nice too. I also like it's not too formal or stuffy but nice enough for a relaxing dinner."
Jay A.,/user_details?userid=EDVFu0pUGbIxUUVp0AydHw,"Manor Heights, NY",7/14/2014,5,I love this place!! Perfect date spot or to just chill out with friends and talk. The music and food are awesome hands down. The drinks are a little pricey but it's the city and this is one of the better places to hang out. The vibe and the setting are really sexy and although the music is going you can have a great convo without having to talk over it. I've been going to Buddakan pretty often since my first visit less than a year ago.
Eyal R.,/user_details?userid=77fysd1N6fkz80OfdpK2bA,"San Francisco, CA",7/5/2013,4,"Great food, highly recommended for sharing. We've epecially enjoyed the different types of dumplings and prawn noodles. Service is above average."
Shiwani N.,/user_details?userid=0pa3qm207utu98NRxO1e-w,"Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY",7/3/2013,4,"The food was just ok, but the decor of the restaurant is just incredible!

M T.,/user_details?userid=THwTVVD3MuA6vJbXVRgTgg,"New York, NY",9/7/2015,2,"Beautiful restaurant with a very romantic dimly lit ambience. Service somewhat slow. Food tasted not terrible but not good, and is SO overpriced and unimaginative. Think PF Changs but more overpriced with smaller portions. You're paying for the environment which I'm not denying is quite amazing inside."

Greg L.,/user_details?userid=szMmiXezKo6mzt2qryPDOg,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",8/31/2013,4,Nice spot with very good food. Service was nice as well. A little pricier than spice market which is a couple of blocks away or Tao but worth it. Try to get one of the table downstairs.
Jose S.,/user_details?userid=T1a30Bl6W0J1_4sB7iqAXg,"Brooklyn, NY",3/2/2015,4,great spot for bday's and dates! the decor is cool. don't expect to be leaving on a full stomach..
Jen S.,/user_details?userid=ugyNunkUKEhQ_aaTYGVkFQ,"Queens, NY",12/10/2014,3,"The space is chic and super trendy. The staff are attractive and plentiful. You almost feel like you have to dress up a bit to make a good impression on them. Good place to grab a drink in the bar or get together with the girls. The food is so-so. Not terrible, but it just never feels good to pay a ton for Chinese food, but you really don't go here for the food. You go for the scene."

We also ordered some veggie dish which never came. Overall I will be back, I definitely want to try more things on the menu !!!  It did not make it to 5 stars because of the few dishes that were just ok and the waiter forgetting a dish but def worth checking out."
Beth S.,/user_details?userid=qjI8xuOFLT2y7fnVtggpoA,"San Francisco, CA",11/14/2008,4,I went to Buddakan on a recent trip to NYC and thought it was amazing.  The decor is absolutely beautiful and the space is huge.  The bar was very busy and the restaurant was packed.  The food was great and there was a great selection of wine and really interesting cocktails.  The service was good too; everyone was really nice and helpful.
Abe L.,/user_details?userid=n4prpd_dHZ5pO9VrS-7Oqg,"New York, NY",2/13/2009,4,"I would come back for the amazing interior. Our waitress was very nice and service was good. The food was good too... not great and overpriced for the small portions, but I expected that. My boyfriend left hungry :("

andre w.,/user_details?userid=T2VBwe37fZJ4H32WUhawzw,"San Marcos, CA",9/9/2009,5,"I absolutely loved this place. We were 20 minutes late for our reservation on a full Friday night... no problem. 15 minutes at the bar and off to our table. Beautiful decor, slightly overpriced drinks and incredible food. We started with the edamame dumplings and liked them so much we immediately ordered another plate. What followed was a veritable sampling of vegetables, beef, black sea bass, & fried rice. Oh wait we haven't even gotten to the dessert! Crying Chocolate and donuts forced us to take a doggie bag home. $240 for 3 people is just fine for me and who gives a damn about SITC."
Melissa A.,/user_details?userid=D_U05ANfa3SI_lQOJeebHA,"Tempe, AZ",8/5/2010,4,The decor was great! The ambiance was just as good. I got the Lobster noodle dish. Not sure what it was called but it was spicy and creamy and so delicious. My husband got the cold pad tai noodles he loved them. And of course the crying chocolate desert was to die for. Highly advise trying this place. A great meet up place for friends right before you go out.

Xavier M.,/user_details?userid=RNpXwICDZ3wi-0QzLJJFbA,"New York, NY",1/12/2011,4,"I went there for dinner last night with a good friend from Miami, my first time, his office is across the street, so it was easy to get to on the C train from Mid-town. The place is cavernous, but very tasteful. The people are very pretty and from all over the world. We were the spanish speaking table, next to us, brits, then on the other side italians and a host of other languages. The food was great, the portions were balanced, not these huge amount of food, but delicate, yet good sized. I had the Cod and Dumplings (Entree and appetizer) and I was very happy. I had a drink called ""Lush"" (yes I enjoy a drink!) it was a Sake based drink that was great. I was very happy with the service and reasonable price."
Vanessa H.,/user_details?userid=xkEtqzaKtg8t16ANjY3SBA,"Manhattan, NY",5/13/2011,4,"Went to this place forever ago and never reviewed it. Loved Loved Loved the seabass wrap appetizer - nicely done. Also had two of the fried ones that were just alright. Everything else - crab fried rice, lobster fried rice, fried fish entree with pineapple sauce (?) was up to par. The only knock is that I could not make sense of my dessert at all. The lemon mousse dish was a conceptual fail...what's with the brown log and the weird cloud candy thing and the red strip of hard candy. Not appetizing and just awful."
Hemanshu M.,/user_details?userid=M1Uf52fRfeucnga1bnNLfA,"Santa Monica, CA",5/27/2011,5,"Love this spot... food is amazing, really cool atmosphere, and the bar/lounge area in the front is not a bad alternative if you didn't make a reservation. I thought the hostess was also helpful, and she helped us get a table in that lounge area on a Friday night when there's always someone waiting to grab a table as soon as someone leaves."
Lester A.,/user_details?userid=kQ3xml0VisOmxZjrRGnvXQ,"Manhattan, NY",6/7/2011,3,"After raving reviews by my friend who is a regular here when he comes to NY, we went for a quick dinner before a movie. We were told there was a 20 minute wait but we could wait in the lounge. We were promptly seated on our table and waitstaff was friendly and had good knowledge of the menu. We ordered the potstickers (5pc), the pork lo mein and the lobster fried rice. Good portions for price and the food was executed brilliantly. Not bad for $40 bucks. Only 3 stars because the front desk girls are way too rude and snobby."
Tori Z.,/user_details?userid=sBg-Zyfj2p6RQ77E54GQLw,"Morristown, NJ",6/21/2011,4,"Been here twice. Loved the fact that from the outside, it looks like a corner of a brick building.  Inside?! WOW! Decor and ambience? Two thumbs way up! Spacious and large! Great presentation as well! They can host a wedding rehearsal dinner party (i.e. Sex and the city!) or a quiet dinner for two like myself!  The only thing we really didn't like was that the tables are pretty close together downstairs; you can hear other ppl's conversations.  But the food is delicious and the drinks original and light! We love this place!"
Melissa R.,/user_details?userid=4mjnMrz5BXM0nEgIkTBNjQ,"New York, NY",7/12/2011,3,If you are an atmosphere/interiors junkie you will have lots to absorb here. Beautiful main dining area from the famed SATC engagement party scene. The bar area gets crowded on weekends and is actually more fun than the restaurant unless you're with a group. Food is tasty (I recommend the lobster fried rice).
Annie S.,/user_details?userid=AQVGr9JsmJCMo2HH4ZLn2g,"Richmond, TX",7/12/2011,3,"Ambiance is nice.  Drinks were good. Food was alright.  To me, it was overpriced Asian food.  Nothing really wowed me.  This is my review of the food that I ate a few years ago.  Maybe I should give it another fair shot and eat their again."
Martin B.,/user_details?userid=_y4MQ_YjdtPQuFUGJ8_G4g,"New York, NY",7/26/2011,5,"Was expecting trendy joint with cute food, but surprised to enjoy a truly exceptional, indeed spectacular meal -- as good as any in the City! The scallion pancakes and jade shrimp dumplings were a great combo to start, and the soft shell crab and chicken a fabulous pairing for entrees, with vegetable stir fry and a rice side.  Truth be told, the coffee was average and carrot cake dessert nothing special, but that still didn't diminish the wonderful meal up till then, and the service couldn't have been better!"
stephanie a.,/user_details?userid=SAmyHne-eg-RSqB9CFvAtw,"New York, NY",11/15/2011,4,"We came in on a Friday night around 10:30pm with no reservation.  We sat at the bar and ordered mojitos (excellent) and rock shrimp appetizer.  The drinks, music, and decor all created a great vibe.  We decided to put our names in for a reservation and told it would be around 12:30pm.  They ended up seating us is about an hour.  Overall great experience!"
Daniel P.,/user_details?userid=yf1HfcW1U8RsDJFzND4POg,"Stamford, CT",11/28/2011,5,Definitely recommended - atmosphere food and service were all top class. The crying chocolate was a great finish to the night. Will definitely be back to enjoy the bar before dining.
Marie S.,/user_details?userid=3jsVB3L0LtKPmiirUYuxdw,"Santa Ana, CA",1/5/2012,4,"The food here was great!  Service was better than the food.  Our only reason for not giving 5 stars is that they sat us at this LONG table and we were elbow to elbow with people that were not in our party of 5.  We asked to move and they couldn't accommodate us.  When we called for a reservation, that should be one of the questions they ask, I mean for the $$$ we should at least get our own table!"

Jerome K.,/user_details?userid=v4ZPjU6mLjHUQfu9-sxd9w,"New York, NY",1/9/2013,2,"Rank C-. Overpriced ""modern/fusion"" Chinese food. Trendy place (if that's worth anything) that has flourished after ""Sex and the City."" Place is full of douchebags and girls who think that they're hot. Jersey/Bridge 'n Tunnel crowd. The sugar snap peas, mao poe tofu (they spell it incorrectly), boneless spare ribs, tuna spring rolls (good), Singapore chili king crab (better at Fatty Crab - Malaysian style), hot & sour scallops are all decent. Better Chinese food at a fraction of the cost in Chinatown."

Amy J.,/user_details?userid=zB6R9bOrc0BPcHtg5E3eWQ,"Veradale, WA",1/27/2013,5,"Our local city girl took us here while we were visiting NYC and it did NOT disapppoint. In fact, we still talk about the food we ate while we were there. Who knew a basement could look so outstanding? Unassuming on the outside and gorgeous inside, this place is a gem. I figured snooty service would come along judging by the looks of this place but we had a wonderful server and never felt rushed or cheap (we didn't order alcohol). Our food was simply amazing and I didn't think the price was inflated, either. Will go back next time we visit the East Coast."
Joanna K.,/user_details?userid=YADabKreT-JA38fQXaKslA,"Ardsley, NY",2/19/2013,5,"Unbelievable food. You have to try the edamame dumplings, and the short rib on scallion pancakes. The service was impeccable. The atmosphere was super romantic and swanky. Cannot wait to go back!"

Molly W.,/user_details?userid=UQ3DGJJmi0JhyLQcH48H7Q,"New York, NY",5/29/2013,5,This restaurant is awesome. Great vibe and atmosphere. Drink menu is stellar and the food is even better. I would trade a limb for the edamame dumplings - they just melt in your mouth. Rock shrimp is also outstanding with a real nice spice to it. Our group of four tried a number of dishes and all were outstanding.
Eithan S.,/user_details?userid=WXyAxZxst-awzDPqwgfTlw,"Manhattan, NY",10/18/2013,5,"This is probably one of the best restaurants I have been to in NYC and by far the best culinary NYC experience!

And we were very lucky to have this really nice, cute and patient guy serving us, I think his name is Fred!  Make sure to ask for a table in his section.

Nurit B.,/user_details?userid=ZCUr7VWCSGSTcRrIDP0xmQ,"Stockholm, Sweden",8/8/2014,4,"We celebrated the last night of our honeymoon in Buddakan, and we had a great time. First of all, the food was absolutely delicious. Every course hit the spot. We went with the waitress recommendation on the number of course and we did not leave either too hungry or too full. The edamame dumplings were to die for as was really everything else we tried. The service was impeccable. Fast, efficient, nice, helpful. They even gave us a little candle in the desert because I wrote in the reservation that we were on our honeymoon. :) The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the place is very loud and the tables are very close to each other. So I don't know if it is best suitable for a romantic dinner. Either way, we had a fantastic time."
Jenna F.,/user_details?userid=KbyPXCrU9Xxw6zhrhk_bnA,"Fredericksburg, VA",7/29/2013,5,Went on Saturday night for my friend's bachelorette party. Impeccable food and service. A must-visit in NYC. Try the specialty cocktails!

Joy V.,/user_details?userid=OQihxILI4o2zGfA0dwO4Qg,"San Francisco, CA",5/23/2015,5,Great fusion chinese food with excellent environment and service and drinks.

Mara S.,/user_details?userid=80B_RkxKRkGFDeTfZ6IN-w,"San Francisco, CA",7/28/2013,4,"I usually am underwhelmed by these nouveau-Asian places the put western spins on things but Buddakan won me over.  The food actually tastes good, the service is decent, the interior is lovely and the drinks are good too!  You can find better Chinese, Japanese, etc. food for much cheaper in their respective ethnic neighborhoods but the experience here is great."
Maria M.,/user_details?userid=NnznzxXW37ip4jqWJKv6rQ,"Manhattan, NY",7/23/2015,3,"Sex and the City hype.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated.  It is definitely fun to go and experience once, but the food wasn't anything to write home about. My food was a little too salty for my taste, and a little overpriced for what we got."
B ..,/user_details?userid=zgL9YBJxSwWIQMa6PN1zkA,"New York, NY",3/16/2015,2,Trendy spot where they filmed SATC. Food is presented well but subpar and way too Americanized.
Bob B.,/user_details?userid=ul4mIuslBzt5BK2ouKV6oQ,"Manhattan, NY",8/9/2014,3,You are paying for the environment.  I would walk to Spice Market for better food and frankly Buddakan and Tao and Hakasan all blend together.  You aren't coming here to eat but rather be in some imagined view of the beginning of a Law and Order episode where you think the rich guy did it.
James M.,/user_details?userid=naSgytQy-narlnyTMYMmEQ,"Providence, RI",3/15/2015,5,Outstanding restaurant. The decor and set up gives the place a great vibe. The General Tso's dumplings are delicious. The sauce is inside the dumpling and it breaks open when you bite into it: so damn good! The wild mushroom chow fun is also excellent. The mushrooms were perfectly cooked and the noodles were coated with a delightful sauce. Check this place out if you're in the area.
Lori B.,/user_details?userid=b0B5PO-8QV0tnmYkl6PMmA,"Jamaica, NY",3/14/2015,4,"I went there with a group for my 26th birthday; coincidentally we all have birthdays in November and it happened to be my bday that day. The ambiance was beautiful. I recommend having a reservation to avoid a long wait. The food is quite pricey so be prepared to spend! The food is worth every penny! I drank a lot of Riesling that night so things are a blur but I do know those lobster egg rolls were ON POINT! I shared a rice bowl with the group I was with. Sharable portions for some items. The food is just so darn good you may have two orders of the same thing because its just that good and the some of the servings aren't filling.  After the 4 of us racked up a bill of like $400+, the waitress wanted to charge us an additional plating fee for us to eat our cupcakes that we ordered from Molly's ( which are superb btw). I felt she could have given us 4 saucers for us to eat our birthday cupcakes. The was charge was $25 for the plates (ridiculous). I would visit Buddakan again and again. Great place for a date night."

I went to the restaurant for drinks only.  We were seated immediately and our server was attentive. The restaurant is very posh and a majority of the patrons looked and were fashionably dressed. Definitely dress to impress! The host and security gave the group I was with, a long look from head to toe before letting us in."

Melissa S.,/user_details?userid=pRntEDAE5GWCc7OqfcxZmQ,"Washington, MI",9/28/2015,4,"Beautiful restaurant.

Lauren W.,/user_details?userid=sva4r1e0uAfFxtTJzN2DQw,"Pleasanton, CA",4/23/2013,5,"One of the best meals I've ever had. The service was superb, very friendly staff and a very rustic yet modern feel to the decor.  Dungeness crab sticky rice, braised short ribs, chili rock shrimp, edamame dumplings, crying cake and almond bread pudding. The 2 of us ate like a party of 4 - and no shame at all! We were even lucky enough to get a tour of the kitchen! Absolutely loved it!"
Richard C.,/user_details?userid=RWqZtiko--VcDPz-FzWHLg,"Jersey City, NJ",4/20/2015,5,"Amazing meal!! Let me start off by saying that our server Jerry was the best. We asked him for his favorites off the menu and he did not disappoint us. We started of with the jade shrimp dumplings,  and the spicy yellowtail yu sheng, both were perfection. The flavor profiles were very well balanced, sweet, spicy and delicious.  For the main course we had the crispy pork, and the kung pao monkfish. The crispy pork was moist, well balanced and tender, great flavor. The monk fish was amazing!! Great sauce with it, sweet, spicy and well balanced also. The side dishes we had were the Dan Dan noodles ( amazing!!), the vegetable fried rice was awesome, and we had the string beans ( which were ok, not great).To finish this all off we had the almond bread pudding (This was the best desert I ever had), it is a must have. One of the best meals I have had in a long time, a bit pricey, but considering how good it was it is worth it."

I went here 5 years ago for my 5 yr anniversary dinner with my boyfriend. He of course didn't make reservation ahead time, so we weren't seated in the actual dining area. There's a section in front to accommodate those without reservation and of course a long wait. I don't remember what we ordered but both our dishes Were delicious! It was pricey but delish. I would return."

Jon W.,/user_details?userid=pLGaOizT9Yd6EW1XfI0PUg,"New York, NY",7/14/2010,3,"Cool scene and good ideas on the food but not all that great in the execution. I really like the shrimp dumplings but have better potstickers. The rock shrimp needed some sweetness. Best on the menu wad the cod. Very flakey and tender, cooked perfectly. The chili crab noodles had excellent flavor but were overcooked and the pork mushu was unfortunately the same. Great flavor but tough. Overall a place for atmosphere but not for Asian fusion excellence"
Mike S.,/user_details?userid=x39ryfnvkzms6aw80wYMXg,"New York, NY",8/19/2010,5,Have been to Buddakan several times now and this restaurant just gets better every time. The menu offers a wide array of dishes that are all worth a try. Definitely an A+ if you want to experience true Asian Fusion with an exceptional ambience.
T S.,/user_details?userid=uIiu6HD6cz5OK6a33nwSIQ,"Jackson Heights, NY",11/4/2010,4,"I've been here enough to say that it's one of my favorite places to go. The decor & atmosphere alone is so nice. It has this darkness to it which makes it even more fun for me to go. The drinks are good but my absolute favorite thing to have is the Genreal Tso's dumplings! I could eat 3 helpings if need be. The charred filet of beef is so good too, the meat is so tender and the mustard they include is smoothe yet a bit spicy. To end the meal, although I don't care for chocolate on chocolate, the crying chocolate is divine. Altogether, it's a meal that will leave you wanting to lay on a bed of feathers."
L J J.,/user_details?userid=6zAs6rXTHdC0D0_on3gwKA,"San Diego, CA",11/11/2010,5,Stunning meal! We returned to buddakan after dining here in 06 and 08 and it still delivers. The meal was fantastic we shared several of the main courses and hot appetizers among our group of 8. Each one as well as the incredible lobster and crab fried rice dishes were delightful. The lamb chop was unbelievably good. The service was great and very attentive. Dessert was three great chocolate dishes ending the meal on a high note. Highly recommend!
Montu P.,/user_details?userid=PEASh3eV0y90lkeRRH3JeA,"Clifton, NJ",1/6/2011,4,Good food and great atmosphere for a few drinks and dinning.

I have been here several times and will be back many more. Solid place to take out-of-towners, dates, and for other special occasions. Or for just a really good meal and experience. I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed."
Cal K.,/user_details?userid=SYCAShHBnCF-SV2EJCb4oA,"Manhattan, NY",2/16/2011,3,"I have to say the decor was very impressive. But the food didn't live up to the expectation. Lobster fried rice was just ordinary, and the lamb was over cooked. If you are a fan of fusion Asian food, lower your expectation about the food you get from Buddakan."
Kartik N.,/user_details?userid=G4pldo-BydSCGg_-6f9C9g,"New York, NY",3/2/2011,5,We went here on a Tuesday night and the place was packed.  Given that its in the meatpacking district you expect a nice decor but this place is  stunning.  The food & service was fantastic.  Just ask the waiter to order the best dishes and you will not be disappointed.  Great place for a business dinner or a special date.
Sid S.,/user_details?userid=U7ZsuWdJV-AjKgqV0dIHqA,"San Francisco, CA",5/9/2011,5,"Wow ! Their menu is unusual and the food tastes outstanding. Excellent ambience, food and service. Definitely on the expensive side."

Barbara M.,/user_details?userid=dHJSeZ8NEMgZd6X1GUcW-w,"New York, NY",9/2/2011,4,"Places with such knockout decor sometimes don't try as hard with the food, but that's not the case with Buddakan.  We've been about 4 times and the food seems to be consistenly delicious. This time we started with a drink at the bar then moved to a great table in the lovely Chinese room. We started with the edamame dumplings, hoisin pork belly dim sum and scallion pancakes with short rib. They were all good but of the 3, the pork belly was the standout. Edamame flavor was subtle, so maybe not for all tastes, though we greatly enjoyed them. Then we shared a whole crispy fish and twice cooked long beans, both terrific, followed by a fabulous chocolate concoction with caramel and coffee ice cream. Major yum!! We considered it a bargain for the quality and walked away stuffed."
Jessica F.,/user_details?userid=cOHHT5JjHkZIT1yNeuIDOA,"Miramar Beach, FL",10/26/2011,5,"Absolutely amazing. I got engaged here last year, and it was perfect. We do an annual girls trip, and visited again this year. We do the party theme choice #3 each time, and have never been disappointed. The food is unreal. The party style is definitely the way to go if there is a group. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. We will definitely make this a part of our trip every year."

Eric B.,/user_details?userid=28j69RdFO5oZaymKFhQBuw,"Manhattan, NY",2/29/2012,5,"How hard can it be to write a review about a place that specializes in perfection? The food and service are amazing.  If you're looking for an opinion, the edamame dumplings are amazing, as is the seafood... as long as you're savvy to Japanese preparation. The blackened cod absolutely melts in your mouth, as do the scallops. Go ape shit and don't be afraid to pair a Spanish Rioja with it. I promise you'll be pleasantly surprised. Be forewarned, though, drinks are not cheap.  This isn't a cozy ""couples"" place.  Bring some friends, be loud, settle in for a few hours and have a good time!"

ALL AMAZING!

The decor in this place is unreal! So ornate and beautiful! Even better than the decor was the food. Oh em gee..literally mouth watering. The portions are rather small so you have to order quite a few samplings if you're starving. We had the rock shrimp and this crispy honey glazed shrimp..both to die for. Then we had lobster egg rolls and lobster rice along side some glazed lamb chomps. Everything came out steaming hot and in a beautiful presentation! I had an amazing cocktail that our friendly waiter suggested. I can't remember the exact name of the concoction but it had St. Germaine, champagne and splash of vodka. Delicious. They even brought out ice cream for the birthday girl (me!) It was truly one of the best dining experiences I have ever had! Kudos to Buddakan!"
Catherine M.,/user_details?userid=XpYFaPO28-akc_r5unvTfg,"Springfield, NJ",6/17/2012,5,Beautiful on the inside kind of hard to find from the outside.

Great food- particularly liked the carrot dumplings and the vegetable rice with coconut curry foam. Its a great place to celebrate special occasions.  The specialty cocktails are a must try with special recommendations for the ""haze"" which is a delicious lychee drink  and the ""fate"" which has a nice fruity flavor! Service is good, although the place is super busy.Reservations are recommended well in advance."
Brian C.,/user_details?userid=NRkdOstoH7QCNP9j1uzKfw,"Middletown, NJ",3/2/2013,5,"I am a huge fan of this place.  The first time I came here was with my wife and one of her friends who was in town on a Saturday night.  We had no reservation but they were fantastic about getting us a table in the front.  The food was fantastic and our waitress was great - walked us through the whole menu.  A follow-up trip (with reservation this time) was equally outstanding.  Although it is trendy in style, it avoids the pretentiousness that is all too common in the Meatpacking District."

They offer excellent cuisine, with a great selection of authentic dishes to tantalize the taste buds. I've been to this restaurant more than 6 times and I am surprised that I've never left a review but this restaurant has excellent ambiance, nice food, worth visiting once if you are in the NY area."
Eric C.,/user_details?userid=HOpchiw8vecNjjEN0y_cPw,"Sydney, Australia",8/3/2015,1,45min wait. Stuffed up booking. We asked about the booking a few times and they kept saying we will find you.

Noelle K.,/user_details?userid=zbxZLLCLzOjsdc8mXWn7sw,"Manhattan, NY",1/5/2015,3,"You go to Buddakan more for ambiance than for consistent cuisine. The food is good, albeit pricey for what it is. What are you getting? Asian ""fusion"" in it's prime. But consistency is where this restaurant sorely lacks. I've been over ten times (this resto is big with the out of towners) and can say I've always returned one item or been disappointed by a couple of plates. The way it works is you order several plates, family style and share. Avoid the duck at all costs, better duck can be eaten in Chinatown. ""Fancy"" Buddakan duck is sorely lacking (in flavor and flare). The dumplings are delicious (but again see Chinatown for delicious, cheap dumplings). The service is usually stellar and they were more than willing to accommodate when I've returned items for being over-seasoned or salty or even just bad. The people are beautiful, the cocktails are delicious. You go to see and be seen (and maybe a bit in between). #unintentionalrhymeskills"
Crystal Y.,/user_details?userid=BQqXGdn1YT1ZlGRI55lKZA,"1, NC",6/21/2014,3,Overrated in my opinion.  The main room is jaw dropping gorgeous.  They serve pan-asian food. Nothing too spectacular :-) I had the lamb that was good

ana d.,/user_details?userid=dRp0d7XYl0mxYmELMzUU6g,"Miami-Dade, FL",3/3/2015,4,"Went for ladies night out to Buddakan for dinner on Saturday night. The restaurant has a great vibe with very high ceilings, and chandeliers in the main dining room. The smaller dining rooms are very cozy, and have a great feel. We ordered the edamame dumplings, the tuna tartar spring rolls, the carrot dumplings, the crab and pork dumplings for appetizers. The only two I recommend are the tuna tartar spring rolls and the carrot dumplings. The others were bland. I also recommend you ask for dipping sauce because some didn't come with sauce. For main courses we ordered the fish, the steak, the vegetable fried rice, the BBQ eel fried rice, the charred broccoli and the stir fried vegetables. I have to say that all were good, and my only complaint is that the BBQ eel should have had pieces of BBQ eel in it. It was bbq eel flavored, but only had a piece at the top for garnish. We ordered a lot so by the time dessert came around we were stuffed. We were celebrating a friends birthday so they brought is a bowl of crushed cereal with ice cream and a happy birthday candle. I use to eat ice cream and cereal as a kid so I loved it, and our waitress was very nice, attentive and remembered the birthday celebration. If you know what to order, or have a little salt or more dipping sauces on the side, it would have been a fabulous meal all around. Definitely worth going, even just once, as its a great ambience."
Nicole E.,/user_details?userid=zifr88iwTwSvRW-pD2WKYQ,"Los Angeles, CA",5/8/2013,5,BEAUTIFUL!! Such a cool restaurant! Try and sit downstairs but anywhere is awesome! Great food too! Must try!

It is poorly lit, but the glow from the smiling Buddha tiles lends a mysterious appeal.  The service is excellent. Now the food: everything was delicious including the amazing cocktails they make.  I ordered tapas type food that we all shared and each one was succulent and in good portions.  The deconstructed brownie was excellent for dessert.  I would eat there any time.  Only thing hard to do is park near the place.  There is a lot about a block away but it is like a warehouse and you need to park about a mile underground and then need to walk back to the surface as oncoming cars come at you.  So take public transportation if you can.  Price = NYC = expensive but not ridiculous.  One person can expect to pay about 75 dollars with dessert and cocktail."

Michael C.,/user_details?userid=VcZPacfsw-K1GWQ-k57HTQ,"TX, TX",2/13/2012,5,"WOW... one of the best places we've been in NY thus far!  Not the cheapest but one of the best.  Overall had a wonderful experience.  Good drinks, good food, and excellent service!  Loved that our waiter was genuine and real and made wonderful suggestions!  We had the charbroiled steak, asian greens, Monkfish..  and the Almond bread pudding was one of the best desserts I've EVER had!"
Namiko S.,/user_details?userid=g4JUX_0_g1ZDjrUzu8CCZA,"Manhattan, NY",3/15/2012,2,"Cocktails were good. But the service did not live up to its reputation. I ordered plain white rice but it never showed up. I don't know how one can possibly think this place is a 5-star restaurant. In terms of dishes, they are overpriced for the quality. I honestly think that I can make better food at home. Further, it is too loud, I could hardly hear our own conversation. There need to be more space between the tables, given that the place is gigantic. I would not go there again."
Sorio D.,/user_details?userid=-YvcYE2rftJMpQ1JJ3EWBw,"Frisco, TX",4/25/2012,3,"The place is really nice but the food does not worth the price. Really expensive for an ""untasty"" meal ... lobster rolls are just filled with boiled lobster and cabbage ! not even a leave of herb or whatever that would bring flavor and I do not exactly remember what else we order (we were a party of 6) but after we left the place (definitely not full)  my husband had a burger once back at the hotel room ! $150 / couple for a meal that I do not even remember, it is expensive. We also had a french rose wine that was awful. Hopefully the place is really nice with a nice atmosphere. I would recommend this place as a bar but not as a restaurant."
Jessica M.,/user_details?userid=RQNOGmpm699YEKC59UTxqg,"New York, NY",8/1/2012,4,Absolutely delicious and really good prices for what you get.  I highly reccomend for a special occasion. I like the fact that everything is shareable! :)
Joshua E.,/user_details?userid=AQdO7zKvFyMDDWuZ6jf8vg,"New York, NY",11/18/2012,5,The place was great. The atmosphere was nice and extravagant yet homey. The food was great. Me and my girlfriend especially liked the pork buns. I can't wait to go back.
Lailah L.,/user_details?userid=L9Cfw1HGmKOukYOQFoYbpg,"Manhattan, NY",12/11/2012,4,"I'm not going to make this long and Drawn out, but My 2 girlfriends went to Buddakan for my friend Hilary's Birthday on Sunday night. We had the best time The food was absolutely delish. We shared our apps, Chili rock shrimp & scallops were amazing!!! I had the Hoisin pork...one word Yummy. Presentation of the food is terrific. It is such a great place for a laid back atmosphere. It's Modern and pleasing to the eye, but not  grandiose. The cocktails were great and the service was A+. I will be bringing people back again very soon!"
A.E. G.,/user_details?userid=7CR6wPzXd9kXvPKQSjxN2A,"New York, NY",12/27/2012,4,Ended up here by accident on Christmas (admittedly because the wait for Redfarm was 2 hours) and it was the happiest accident ever. I try to avoid places like this (which I assumed to be more of a name drop than an actual dining experience). Everything was delicious. We ate mostly meat / rice dishes because one of my friends isn't a seafood fan. Nothing was remarkably better than the others however I thought the udon with lime sorbet and peanut sauce was interesting and great. I subtracted a star because the dessert (we got the warm chocolate ganache) was not good. At all. But I would definitely go back for seafood and a different dessert option.
Livi B.,/user_details?userid=DXnnCqQklQNJ_Vi5d-SVAA,"Manhattan, NY",12/29/2012,4,"Great experience tonight for dinner.  We arrived and we were able to check our coats at the door with friendly prompt service.  We waited about two minutes in the lounge to be seated for our reservation.  The best thing about his place is the space- it is huge and nicely decorated!  It is large enough and uniquely laid out so that you can still have an intimate quite dinner.  There is constantly a worker nearby to assist with whatever you may need.  I didn't love my drink - it was some cocktail with berries apples and passion fruit liqueur- which tasted like cough syrup.  All of the food I tasted was good.  I was not blown away, but everything was good.  I will go back- mainly for the atmosphere and service."

Matt L.,/user_details?userid=-F9JT_4Eu-Qojd6X2gN_Cg,"Birmingham, AL",1/23/2013,4,Exemplary service. Food was definitely not traditional. I ate mainly appetizers only because I wanted to try a wider sample of their menu.

D L.,/user_details?userid=Yrx4VTnmGFkpIJn3shmiHw,"New York, NY",1/16/2015,5,"I used to live 2 blocks from here in my glorious 20's and went to this restaurant frequently b/c w/o fail, it was always a fantastic and inspired meal.   Went again recently, maybe 2-3 yrs since my last visit, and was pleasantly surprised nothing has changed (in a good way)- everything was delicious and service was great.  Highly recommend this place."
Priscilla L.,/user_details?userid=IiMBN02kWBMQSQn2--dFGA,"New York, NY",3/23/2015,5,"This place is great! The atmosphere is really cool with their big chandlers and dripping candles. Don't let them seat you in the back. The best seats are in the middle under the chandlers. The food is also really good. It's asian fusion and presented very decoratively. It's pretty fancy aka expensive, but a great place if you want to impress a girl! ;)"
Kimberly K.,/user_details?userid=hCgwMzQYun5aO44vrIPPNQ,"Rye, NH",3/19/2015,5,"Some of the most delicious food I've experienced in my life!  Killer atmosphere too, just extremely expensive."
Thad W.,/user_details?userid=7fu93jyfabH0G8KCehB8lw,"New York, NY",8/1/2013,5,"Fabulous Fabulous Fabulous ! We just came back from my birthday dinner for two. Great service but never made us feel uncomfortable. Excellent waiter: on time, kind, good looking. Delicious food and drinks: appetizers, entree, dessert, cocktails and a single espresso. Finally, two nice Australian ladies sitting next to our table to have a pleasant little chat and take pictures of each other. Ill be back for sure !"
Sabrina L.,/user_details?userid=rxCUvWsHsIQyi5hRcghh8A,"Manhattan, NY",2/28/2015,1,Good food. Poor management. Stairs were not clean and caused a friend to fall. Manager or staff did not acknowledge and gave a dessert on the house with a business card. Their reassurance to the friend was that no one saw so she shouldn't be embarrassed.
Beth J.,/user_details?userid=eYDPyK_Y1lOII7vp8ZRNCQ,"Naperville, IL",10/23/2014,4,"Fun vibe, always crowded. Best dishes were actually the cheaper dishes like the asian mixed greens and Dungeness crab sticky rice. Salt and pepper black bass was presented beautifully but was overcooked. Drinks were fun. Wild mushroom chow fun was way too salty. Service was great. It's a place I am not dying to go back to but I would as a fun place."
Swagata R.,/user_details?userid=boZXeki-pJG-rzxA9NWyYQ,"New York, NY",2/27/2015,5,"Awesome food and ambience! My husband and I , sometimes go for our date nights there."
D M.,/user_details?userid=c0OWt3dKEA311b6sPgy-DA,"WALL STREET, NY",12/22/2014,4,I have always enjoyed Buddakan.  The lighting is a bit to dark for me. The service is great. It can get loud. Definitely a place for couples and friends. I have seen families there but it doesn't seem to be great for little ones.
Dodo D.,/user_details?userid=La02c-JxkaK3us_z9duP4w,"Diamond Bar, CA",7/15/2014,5,"Everything at the restaurant was perfect.  The service, ambience, and food were all great.  My friend said their drinks were also great but because my other friend is pregnant so we just had water.  The dim sum menu looked great.  I almost wanted to order one of each.  We end up ordering the Lobster and Crab Shu Mai, Sea bass Roll, and Scallion pancake with spare ribs.  I love all three and especially the scallion pancake because the texture was just spectacular.  The pancake with the beef topped with green apples makes it sweet, salty, and crispy in one bite.  For entree, we had the steak and pekking duck fried rice.  The steak was very tender but the fried rice was way too salty.  I'm guessing the chef is probably non-asian because when you stir fry rice with soy sauce you don't need to add salt anymore.  For dessert, we had the banana bread pudding and green tea donuts.  If you ever order these two, eat the green tea donut first because the sweetness of the banana bread pudding will cover the taste of the donut and make it bland.  Of course, that's what I did and I end up not being able to taste the donut at all.  I will definitely go back and try all the other dim sum items.  This is definitely a great place for food and hangout."
Brooke B.,/user_details?userid=rT7-z-7x9hsOOQv8IWXqXw,"Rye, NY",2/19/2015,5,I always love this spot. It's so beautiful and fun. Lots of good food - but you must get the Edamame dumplings!
Brett G.,/user_details?userid=nSX37WbifG7rZGP6MWWklw,"New York, NY",5/6/2015,3,Only there once. Seemed a bit overpriced and the service was just ok but perhaps I had high expectations
Neftali M.,/user_details?userid=P3Fo-YauL-lvzgTh7nq1Lg,"Yorktown Heights, NY",5/6/2015,1,"I went to Toyota North in Mt. Kisco and I had the worst experience I have ever had in a car dealer. They are dishonest in fact they are criminal. The salesman told me that the car I was trading was in a major accident and he could only give me $ 5,000 for it even though I was the original owner and the car was never in an accident. He presented me with a phony copy of a car fax.  I went to Curry Toyota  and they offered me $ 6,800 for the car and gave me a better price for my purchase .STAY AWAY FROM THESE CROOKS!"
Ni36 X.,/user_details?userid=e8VjjP4NvP9mh1RB0BTOpA,"Ronkonkoma, NY",5/4/2015,5,"Went with a group of about 8, so we were offered a special price fix menu- absolutely delicious! I would go back everyday and eat if I could! Unlimited replenishment on the food, but really it is not even needed, you'll be stuffed. And the dessert to top it off at the end. So pleased!"
Badju S.,/user_details?userid=-7rO61LllTizHDt6PUShdg,"Jersey City, NJ",5/3/2015,5,"This place is just A-MA-ZING! My now boyfriend took me to this place on our first date, I was blown away! The ambiance, food, & service was just FAN-TAS-TIC! And the price is not too bad considering the area. This is my go to place now in the meat packing district!"
Roz M.,/user_details?userid=j_7uhhqy7W6qUgAGRNYiaQ,"New York, NY",6/30/2013,4,"I went here with my girlfriends and it was so packed we couldn't get a table unless we wait for hours but we were lucky enough to find a space at the bar and shared the table with other nice people. We ordered the rocket shrimp some dumpling s edemame and other appetizer size meals and just shared it like family style.  I loved everything that we ordered. The cocktails are steep in price but this is new York so it is expected. Over all, I would go to this place again on a night of the time with my girlfriends."
Ronald D.,/user_details?userid=vrRGPdai8ITyXZe7UnP8SA,"Manhattan, NY",4/28/2015,4,beautiful atmosphere.  The staff is very nice but the food comes out quickly.  If you are not careful they will have you in and out in 30 minutes.  Otherwise everything is great.  There specialty dishes are all wonderful
Cookie M.,/user_details?userid=sZt7e4Pt8r7ddOcZzP9rwQ,"Forest Hills, NY",4/16/2013,5,"The sexy room, the beautiful trendy space and the food will make you fall in love with Buddakan. Edamame dumplings...always order those. Pork buns, fried rice both lobster and vegetarian...amazing. The desserts are a workof art and with flavor profiles that surprise. The bar is a great place to start off your night and make reservations. A must!"
Sri B.,/user_details?userid=sJWkHvMEHcyAAwjrl4HCGQ,"San Francisco, CA",1/27/2015,3,The restaurant is a mega meatpacking restaurant. I'm not sure why you go there unless you have a big party and want a reservation on short notice.  The food is okay.  The decor is a bit outdated.  And it's not cheap.  You don't see NYC locals going here.
Sheva E.,/user_details?userid=AMl6l0FVXr73BJY4jFr8zQ,"New York, NY",11/18/2014,5,"I was very surprised by the food here. l was with a group of friends and had a very good experience. I kind of thought it might be like some of the other restaurants in the area where you basically pay a ridiculous amount for mediocre food but it was not.  As long as I have a good experience I can justify the prices.  Our party wanted to try a variety of things on the menu...we decided to not do any type of bottle service and individual cocktails instead and our bill was over $500 for a party of four to help give perspective on the minimum amount I think one should expect to spend if you want to have a real variety. The menu has a sharing concept but the portions are small.  We had so many things coming to the table I honestly cannot remember all of the names, but it was a solid menu.  I understand why this restaurant has been around for quite some time now and has been able to maintain consistent business every night every week.  You must come here if you're looking for food with Asian fusion in this area.  Much better than a similar restaurant nearby...Great job Buddakan!"

Brendan P.,/user_details?userid=ylps6dg4Fmv0j5O7Z7LfSw,"Mamaroneck, NY",4/8/2015,3,"I suppose one eats here because of the atmosphere, not necessarily the food (who would pay $30 for beef and broccoli?). Drinks were well prepared, the service was good (and quick, despite their busy Saturday night crowd). Still, I can't shake that uncomfortable feeling I have after spending $75 on two cocktails, a small appetizer and a bowl of rice."

I loved everything about Buddakan. I've been wanting to go to Buddkan for quite some time but never got around to it until this past weekend when I had some friends visiting from out of town. This is a great place to bring out of towners and of course to enjoy great drinks and food!

Get there early to have drinks in the lounge! I recall the food being delicious and intricate. Pricey but definitely what you would expect at a restaurant of this caliber. If are in the neighborhood stop by and check it out by at least having a drink at the bar.

Virginia Y.,/user_details?userid=ntJ0mR5D4JqJOzsYZV-cxw,"San Francisco, CA",4/5/2014,5,"I had my birthday dinner here and was quite pleased. Antonio was my server and he was quite attentive and very informative on all the dishes. I ended up ordering 5 appetizers to be shared amongst 3 people. We had the edamame dumplings, chili rock shrimp, peking duck salad, hoisin glazed pork belly and beef lettuce cups. My best friend requested for the crying chocolate which was malted chocolate ganache and vietnamese coffee ice cream drizzled with milk caramel. My favorite of the appetizers was the hoisin glazed pork belly and the chili rock shrimp. The edamame dumplings was a bit too filling for me. As for the dessert, I preferred the chocolate ganache over the vietnamese coffee ice cream. All in all, I really like this place. I love the lighting and the interior decoration here. The moment you step into Buddakan, it's like you're transformed to another world, a secret universe of divine cuisine. I would definitely come back for another special occasion. Thanks for a great birthday, Buddakan."

Mila M.,/user_details?userid=TP5zGh7nNevtQ8MRrI69NA,"Queens Village, NY",3/22/2015,4,Buddakan never disappoints. The atmosphere lends itself to romantic first dates or fine dining and drinks with the girls.
Boukje S.,/user_details?userid=rzsBFbtimuU9hAjB4EJIpg,"New York City, NY",3/20/2015,4,"Great restaurant with perfect service. The food is mindblowing. A perfect night out. One time we had to wait for an hour to be seated, to compensate this we received complementairy drinks and bites. Good service"
Bev P.,/user_details?userid=yxccNyKr-YPWScMDNN2uzg,"New York, NY",3/20/2015,3,"i have attended a disproportionate amount of corporate events here and it's easy to see why, Buddakan excels at handling large groups. The service is always excellent and their staff is superb. It is also a gorgeous space! Great for dates and bringing visitors. I gave them three stars because I find the food average bordering on sub-par. The majority of their dishes are just too sweet. Their drinks are excellent though. I wouldn't turn down a trip to Buddakan but I also wouldn't go out of my way to have dinner there either."
Soleil L.,/user_details?userid=QkEkDmbuHBQ2KxsRJgNhZA,"Secaucus, NJ",10/26/2014,5,"Absolutely nothing to complain about. This place is huge you can get lost in here but I did not mind. Every floor has its' own decor. I rarely rate anything 5 stars but Buddakan is  a gem. The food is amazing I don't recall what I ordered since I went for my college graduation in May but the flavors, seasonings , everything is cooked to perfection. I love the dim lighting and the walls with murals. The servers and hosts I had were very attentive and accommodating . The prices are not bad if you appreciate an elegant night with fine cuisine . Definitely dress up but not too dressy . I will continue to dine here for years to come and It has been far too long I can't wait to go again !"

The black cod was super delicious and I really love the flavor and the combination. The service was fantastic. It was very dark and a little loud but not as loud as Tao. I definitely prefer Buddakan more than Hakkasan and Tao from food to service.

Ayshia H.,/user_details?userid=y5kXSXEqiH9MeBHXc7OdpA,"New York, NY",5/8/2014,4,"I had made reservations for a surprise birthday dinner for my best friend and some of our close friends. We arrived with one person short and they told us that all parties must be present for us to be seated. So I said that person wasn't going to come. They sat us at a table where there were more than enough seats available. So when we our last guest arrived, he was good to go. The food came in little protions but it was really good. I don't even think it stayed on the table for more than about 10 seconds before we all shared it. The service was really good, I don't remember the name of our waiter, but it was a man. I whispered to him that it was her surprise birthday and if he could bring out something for her to blow out, reminding him that she is gluten free. He brought out some fancy ice cream and chocolate plate. It looked amazing. Overall I had a great experience there. 4 stars since she tried to make us wait, this is New York! People get stuck in traffic or on the subway."
Carly W.,/user_details?userid=XxBx44rPSTAy648d3IDjig,"Manhattan, NY",3/2/2015,4,"Great for sharing plates. Fun atmosphere. Honestly not my one of my favorite Asian restaurants in the city, which surprised me since there's so much hype around it. Note: will make you wait for your whole party to be seated, though the bar area is cool."
Mark S.,/user_details?userid=9WLR034h9bBkYeKxOYzAUg,"Manhattan, NY",2/27/2015,1,This is unreal!  Why would anyone wait for a Tao copy with bad food when across the street is the real thing with great food.  2x and cant believe it could get worse but it did
Melanie A.,/user_details?userid=sdq_8jRrBE1hvzqjZx30hQ,"Manheim, PA",4/16/2015,3,food is delicious - attitude from the people at the door kind or ruins the experience.  place is way too big and not very intimate.  Would be a much better place if it were smaller with less attitude....
Bernice H.,/user_details?userid=hJcXTyT7_Lw_5w6jocMnfw,"Portsmouth, VA",4/14/2015,1,"The bottom line two weeks ago was very poor!!!!! Food was cold and service was could have been better. sever walk pass us didn't offer more tea, my husband glass was empty!!!"
J K.,/user_details?userid=VbiGINhSpPrGfo_Y57Ar6g,"Chicago, IL",6/9/2014,3,"Beautiful space and ambience, great cocktails and EDAMAME DUMPLINGS WERE AMAZING. Everything else was just average. It's hard to really elevate Mapo tofu , lo mein, or fried vegetables. I expected more from the Chinese sausage fried rice but just tasted like regular fried rice. The steak was well-cooked and the mustard sauce was delicious. For dessert, the bread pudding was a hit and the green tea doughnuts were perfectly soft and warm! Wish there was more black sesame paste! Would go again just for the edamame dumplings...."
Kath K.,/user_details?userid=DyYMKhPRhTo9MJCKOLmzBw,"New York, NY",12/3/2014,4,"Fantastic! Have the monkfish, chowfun and the veggie rice amazing!!!!!!"
Brian L.,/user_details?userid=B8zkA0OzQF0EyEb91XYBxA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/26/2014,4,"I took a huge group of clients here and it is a great place for client entertaining, just based on the cool atmosphere and vibe alone. I thought the food was pretty good, but nothing that really blew me away. I ordered the most expensive tasting menu for 9 of us so we got to really taste most of the dishes. Good for special occasion or cool factor, but not really worth the price for the tasting menu on an everyday basis. The best item was the General Tso's Dumpling which coincidently happens to be one of the cheapest items on the menu."
Hariet M.,/user_details?userid=QMiwSHA4A5OpsWtMrl_4_w,"Washington, DC",4/9/2015,3,"The food flavors are pretty good. The textures are nice. The plating is very much like the decor, gaudy and pretentious like a northern gal in pearls...what's the point? The food is no better than some notable affordable chinese spots in NY, but triple the price bc of some tacky lighting and ridiculous plateware. Good spot to get taken to, not to pay for."
Craig R.,/user_details?userid=0l8yDYcvPEIQi-kfgEuIAw,"El Segundo, CA",2/16/2015,4,"Great food, coat check lost my scarf and gloves though. Not great when it's 12 degrees outside."

I actually prefer the lounge area which is huge. The restaurant has an upstairs and downstairs with beautiful chandeliers. The food is pretty good, not fantastic, but good and when you mix the people watching, decor, food, atmoshpere, it's a win win for me. Good for a date or just hanging out, like I said the food is good, not great but when you mix everything together, it's definitely worth it especially if you're drinking."

Now on to the food. Because it was a bday dinner, there was a prefixed menu but I loved what we had! The edamame dumplings and the chinese sausage fried rice were my favs out of the bunch! There was also this pork lomein that I didn't try because I don't eat pork but my friend raved about it!!! The drinks were great as well. I will def come back to try the rest of the menu. Very swanky place, great for sex and the city girls night out or a hot date!!!"
Tima D.,/user_details?userid=cm6_4OQncB13syIgWO40uA,"Chicago, IL",5/30/2014,4,"Beautiful decor and atmosphere. It feels very NYC in here. The wait was long even with a reservation, but the reso was made late so I guess it goes with the territory. As far as staff goes everyone was very nice. The lighting in the bar area is extremely dark, I guess its for ambiance but you cant even see the bar menu. As far as food goes you MUST order the edamame dumplings. My mouth is drooling just thinking about them. We ordered another round of those. The dim sum was good but it was soooooo hot (temp wise) I burned my lip pretty bad... so beware. Overall the waiter was nice and drinks were amazing. Not sure if I would come here to fill up on food as the menu items are small and pricey but if you are looking for a fun place to hang out and have some snacks this is it."
Esther L.,/user_details?userid=JZH2n5WrfPYJPM9MYivSHw,"Los Angeles, CA",10/30/2013,3,"Came here with some friends since we were visiting and we wanted to try out a fine dine restaurant in the area. My friend made reservations and the only possible times they had seemed to always be at 5pm or 10pm. We chose the earlier reservation and when we came in, we were seated on the top floor near a family with children. T.T You can imagine my disappointment in our seating placement. On top of that, our server was a jerk and told us that 3-4 plates would not be enough. We obviously went to the host and requested for another table and we were seated at a more secluded table downstairs. We ordered the rock shrimp, pork belly, Lobster Fried Rice and Mushroom Chow Fun which was WAY more then enough for us. We didn't even get the finish the plates! We ended our meal with the crying chocolate and it was DELICIOUS. I would absolutely recommend ordering this dessert. I think it came out to be $30-$40 each person which isn't bad at all. I took a star off for that horribly rude server which I can not seem to recall his name but he had fairly long dirty blonde or blonde hair and another star off for the initial horrible seating. You're seriously going to seat a group of girls trying to enjoy their time next to a family with kids -.-"
Gaurav N.,/user_details?userid=dCJb3cgl2aPI8AIb_BHBnQ,"Livingston, NJ",11/24/2014,4,Wonderful ambience and decor! Food and desserts were great. Very few options for vegetarians. They have some good tofu dishes but though. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.

Sam J.,/user_details?userid=GuePb_JjkxgCiOygxtbsSA,"New York, NY",2/7/2015,5,"Such great everything! Food, decor, music, vibe, everything. Its a bit fancy, and often hard to get a reservation, but they do seat walk ins in the front lounge easily if you ever want to take a shot. Get the edamame dumplings!"
Joanna N.,/user_details?userid=5iIWIeI2UPEZTO7o4fn3Ug,"Singapore, Singapore",5/13/2012,5,"One of my favorite spots to go for dinner on a Friday night with friends.  I love coming here with a group and sitting in the gorgeous main dining space.  The food is consistently fantastic, the service is spot-on, and the cocktail menu is amazing!  I often come here and take out of town friends and family and they always love it."

Kris C.,/user_details?userid=mhcPMWVNteRy90DXAUj2PA,"Media, PA",3/20/2015,4,I have eaten here many times and it is always pleasing. Excellent service no matter how busy they are and the food is very good for the price. Excellent for group gatherings. The food is perfect to share and the service is non intrusive.
Mary H.,/user_details?userid=1EXqNNsb1aTk4cHGTq1QlA,"Manhattan, NY",1/28/2015,3,"Love the whole ambience. But  (hate to say it ) I've had better Asian food. It's expensive enough to expect mind-blowing tastes. Bizarrely, my mind was only blown by their Banana Bread Pudding dessert. Scrumptious, tho not Asian."

J M.,/user_details?userid=nXtaILPYNesFBSa1hBAAOg,"New York, NY",3/16/2015,4,Absolutely LOVE this place from the decor to the food. You can't go wrong. Have been going here for years and the they've always been right on point.
Lauren G.,/user_details?userid=2eHP4NSczz8UftkKy0SC7w,"Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY",10/7/2006,3,"Ok I've been trying to eat at this place since umm April when they opened but every Thursday, Tuesday and one other day we tried there were no reservations. Finally we got one for last night at 10:15. When you enter it's a little spooky because the ceilings are immense and there are these HUGE steal beams everywhere. You walk to this hostess table, tell them you have a reservation and they escort you to a lounge where apparently you have to then wait for another hostess to put you on a list to get your table. We sat in the catacombs upstairs very dark compared to the lit library downstairs. Anyway our waiter Byron came over to take our order and I wanted their crab fried rice without eggs-he very curtly was like oh they won't do that. Then suggested veggie fried rice with no egg which we decided was fine. We got all of our food (we shared appetizers) before our drinks even arrived. He forgot one persons drink-then we ate. I enjoyed the edamame dumplings and the frogs legs. The portion sizes were good to share. We also had the squash dumplings-didn't like their consistency and calamari salad which was good. But the kicker was the rice. As soon as the bus boy put it down we look in and wait there is a shitload of egg in it. I was annoyed and picked it out. The best part was the desert. Crying Chocolate which I would highly recommend. It was $126 for 4 people which wasn't too bad. But if you are a person who makes modifications to a menu-this is NOT the place to go, everything is mass produced so they won't alter it."

Jennifer F.,/user_details?userid=_nv6VAcH9M3iHs-fAGPBPw,"Manhattan, NY",8/23/2014,5,"Everything was soo tasty! You could really tell that the food was fresh. I also loved that you could taste the specific flavors of each item -- nothing seemed drowned in salt and butter. Oh and the dessert! We had the green tea doughnuts and crying chocolate - both were beautifully presented and soo delicious. Yes, it's true that portions are on the smaller side compared to other restaurants, but I thought they were a perfect size - just enough to feel satisfied but not stuffed. The portions are especially good if you are like me and like trying various items on the menu. My friend was drinking cabernet and I tried two different cocktails (both with lychee). I really liked the 'Longevity'. It was a nice balance between sour and sweet and was pretty strong. The decor is amazing, and the music was really cool and at a perfect volume. Yes, it's expensive, but the food is worth it and you are also paying for the experience. I was very happy with the service! The courses hit the table at perfect times and our waiter was very funny, professional, and helpful. All of the other staff were great too :)"
Steven S.,/user_details?userid=Vm914gKQoquijM5IVRjKKA,"Manhattan, NY",3/15/2015,4,pretty cool and hip place. love the vibe especially on fridays. i am not sure why but i feel like going out every time have dinner and a drink  there. the portion are sizeable and quite tasty. prices are probably too high given the quality and the crowd is not what it used to be 5 years ago.
A W.,/user_details?userid=mOd7yXLo-G_O7J03aGyhaw,"Forest Hills, NY",8/28/2013,3,"This restaurant has great ambiance for a date and the servers were attentive, but the food was only okay."
Noa B.,/user_details?userid=AnEPqys9NYHiHZG28CvFjQ,"New York, NY",1/6/2014,5,"Absolutely love this place! I love the way it is designed inside, very modern upstairs and around the restaurant down stairs while the room with the big table down stairs looks more traditional/Victorian looking. I have tried several dishes here: mushroom and sugar pea dumplings, vegetable dumplings (they are shaped like carrots) wild mushroom chow fun, Asian green stir fry, sugar snap peas, and the black bean silken tofu. The chow fun I asked to be made vegan. The tofu is simply amazing. It has like a ginger-sweet like sauce with squash, mushrooms, peppers, and tofu. I always get it! The vegetable dumplings are also amazing. They are not heavy because the wrapping around then is very thin. They are steamed and come with a sauce on the side. I can honestly say I enjoy everything I get here. The only one that was anything special was the Asian green stir fry. The staff is always so attentive and when I tell them I am vegan they are very helpful with picking out dishes I can have. The only time I had a problem was when I asked for soy milk on the side for my tea and they said they only have almond milk so they brought it but it didn't smell like almond milk and after several times of asking I found out it was regular milk. As for drinks, I like their 'Fever' drink which is a jalapeño - pomegranate drunk. As for desserts, I wish they had vegan options!"
Caity F.,/user_details?userid=XOkYY1GTRBDZcgBtEGjAJQ,"Alexandria, VA",6/16/2014,1,"Had a reservations for Saturday night 6/14. My whole party, 4 of us, showed up on time and checked in. The hostess told us to sit at the extremely busy bar and she would come find us. We sat for 30 minutes, past our reserved time and had no one come check in us and no waitress ever stopped by to ask us if we wanted a drink. . She told us that there were still 2 tables in front of us. During the 30 minutes we were sitting there we had seen multiple groups being sat who had showed up after us. My SO check back in with the hostess and she once again asked if we were all here, which we had told her before when we checked in. We were not happy with this so we choose to leave. Buddakan is loud, dark and pretentious. I felt like I was in Vegas at a club with people being there to be seen. I really wanted to like the place based on previous experiences at Starr Restaurant Le Diplomate in DC being superb."
Josefin B.,/user_details?userid=gVgDji7vyRk5lOdnl49uvQ,"Manhattan, NY",1/7/2015,3,The place is cool and the food is good but slightly overpriced. I think you pay for the experience/atmosphere rather than for the food which although good you can get even better for more reasonable prices elsewhere.
Neil W.,/user_details?userid=3hc-0IRa2Gud0bmdEJiZiw,"Manhattan, NY",1/1/2015,5,"This place really does deserve five stars in food, service, and atmosphere.   It has now become a New York landmark and if you can get a table at a time that works for you, it is very hard to pass up.    Great for groups and special occasions.   Very convenient if you want to be in/near the meatpacking district, Chelsea and/or the West Village."
V G.,/user_details?userid=xBvtWSNUApF2_RQ3iiRzSg,"New York, NY",11/17/2006,5,"i loved the atmosphere. the main room is just grand. when i first heard about it i thought the food would be amercanized chinese food, but not so. the food was pretty authentic.  our waiter used the same lines on every table, but the service was great too."

Lauren T.,/user_details?userid=r78L3ZLops_1MFvEYBbltg,"New York, NY",12/27/2014,4,"Great take on fusion-y Asian, delicious mixed drinks.   Dimly-lit makes the ambiance perfect for a date -- not necessarily first date as the acoustics aren't great for conversation.  However, fun, sleek, funky vibe with decent food and good location next to Chelsea Market."

Ainsworth L.,/user_details?userid=dUy31rhGGIsxE6PalwxUGQ,"Jersey City, NJ",4/5/2014,5,let me start off by saying this was a very special evening for me and buddakan did an OUTSTANDING job for me . I went on a sunday evening which was birthday and one of the most imporant days in my life. I surprised my girlfriend by proposing to her on my birthday i thought it was the perfect time no woman would expect there boyfriend to ask there hand in marriage but what a perfect gift for any man. Michael the  Maitre-d understood how important this day was and in my opinion gave me the best seat in the house in the corner looking at the spectacular view of the banquet hall kudos to michael. Our waitress Erin O. was very knowledgeable and polite she even recommended the vegetable rice with a coconut foam It was absolutely delicious. Our appetizers were the edamame dumplings with is extremely creamy on the inside and bursting with wonderful flavors and im not even a fan of edamame and i loved them my lady loved them as well. The second appetizer was the hoisin glazed pork belly mmmmmmmmm!! there was a party in my mouth the fatty but charred pork belly was cooked perfectly layed in the steamed buns with the spicy shallots my god im going back just for this alone its that good. For our entrees i wanted to try the peking duck and it was my first time and it wont be my last amazing my lady had the beef with some type of pasta i forgot but delicious as well. what i loved was that every dish had its own personality too it and the flavors were not recycled over and over. our drinks we had was SAKE I LOVE SAKE . The ambience is like nothing I have ever seen the restaurant is pretty huge we were in hogswort as i like to call it the main banquet but there are 3 other different settings as well. Joel the manager did an excellent job bringing the ring out on the crying chocolate dessert my girlfriend had know clue what was going on i stood her up and got  on one knee and proposed she was in shock and said YES woohoo WE WERE GIVEN CHAMPAGNE AND DESSERT WAS TAKEN CARE OF BY BUDDAKAN again I love this place and highly highly recommend it perfect 10 on everything again thank you to Michael Erin o AND JOEL AND ALL THE STAFF FOR MAKING THIS DAY UNFORGETTABLE.
Rashila A.,/user_details?userid=SQHztBtWA4jNeQEdzc-Neg,"Hoboken, NJ",12/17/2014,4,Love this place. Being a vegetarian i'm glad they cater for us. Nice ambience. A little pricey though.
Vaishali N.,/user_details?userid=Qob6NDTb1ciHjic4WTDGuQ,"Sugar Land, TX",9/27/2014,1,"If I could give this restaurant a ""zero"" rating I would. I was visiting NYC with my friends and we had made reservations a month in advance. Despite that, they seated us 55 minutes late. The service was sub par at best. We waited a long time for our drinks. We had specifically asked for steamed rice to be brought out with our entrees, but our entrees came, got cold, but the rice didn't come. The food was absolutely terrible; there was not a single dish that I would recommend. I will say that their appetizers are very good and unless you want to make a meal out of appetizers, stay away from this restaurant. We asked to speak with the manager on three different occasions, but nobody showed up. We finally got the manager to come after our entrees had gone cold as the rice didn't come. His explanation for the late seating and the poor service was ""well..we are very busy"". When I am spending my hard earned money, that is just not a good excuse. I will never visit this restaurant again and certainly do not recommend that anyone go there. There are far too many good restaurants in NYC to be wasting your precious time here."
Amanda C.,/user_details?userid=AKaKHfEBErRHUD1py2JWhA,"Queens, NY",5/21/2014,3,I have a mixed review on this place. Buddakan is gorgeous. Its just kind of expensive for the food. I did a prix-fixe menu with my friends. We basically tried everything but the one thing that stuck out was the edamame dumplings. Those were really good!! Other than that its a great place for a date and the staff are really great as well.
Sam F.,/user_details?userid=7V1iNvTYuUe5Zl2hhDeW3A,"Manhattan, NY",12/8/2014,5,Very unique dining experience. The building is massive- couldn't believe I was actually in NYC! The food was very good.
Emily S.,/user_details?userid=IG_Z5HHK7pW6ESzbB37evw,"New York, NY",12/7/2014,4,This place is a bit big if you're looking for an intimate dining experience....but it is great for groups. All of the food is delicious
Mike S.,/user_details?userid=nNx435GLcmrYaFCjnKAvLg,"Manhattan, NY",1/27/2015,2,I thought the food was way over priced. When the food came out it was cold and stale. I am never going back. I only gave it 2 starts because they have a good drink selection.

Annie S.,/user_details?userid=b3Dt3CaowhogyHSUvsXTTA,"Manhattan, NY",5/6/2014,5,"We had to reserve our table 3 weeks in advance but the experience was as expected. Need to say more?

MARY L.,/user_details?userid=mSDUBykg_CH2iydVRCGMFQ,"Chatham, NJ",1/17/2015,5,excellent food. service outstanding. worth every penny! The peking duck is good to share with 2 or 3 people.

Alex S.,/user_details?userid=x7u1pveICoOMn6osdojIOw,"New York, NY",10/31/2012,4,Don't judge this place by the exterior...grab drinks before dinner in the lounge but make sure you sit downstairs in the incredible dining room to get the full experience. Took awhile to be seated but it was worth the wait - the food was great! Couldn't get enough of the rock shrimp.
Kayla S.,/user_details?userid=spCIlWycEv2gDBvNqV-CEA,"Manhattan, NY",1/4/2015,4,"I really enjoyed Buddakan, a bit pricy for the quality/quantity of food that you are getting, but nonetheless, the service was solid, the environment was cool and the food was good. I would absolutely go back."
Felicia M.,/user_details?userid=Oyyhl6cg-6ZDnYpCtslu3g,"Brooklyn, NY",6/21/2013,3,"Buddakhan is a great place to dine if you are looking for something trendy and cool.  The food is good but it is not the place if you are looking for cuisine fit for foodies.  The menu is Pan Asian, so it contains variations on traditional dishes.  The lobster fried rice is good but a bit salty. ...the same goes for the wok tossed noodles with prawns.  However, I must say that the cocktails are delish. I had the charm, which contains passion fruit liquor, berries, prosecco and apple."
b a.,/user_details?userid=TqaoGUcUbe1CdnjSxiKiXQ,"Brooklyn, NY",2/15/2012,1,EWWW RUDE RUDE EVIL BARTENDER! apparently too busy to do her job which is ummm ask people if they would like a drink..and then SERVE the drink. not too hard. Especially when there is nobody else at the bar. HELLO DO YOUR JOB!!! WILL NEVER GO BACK.
Tamara V.,/user_details?userid=kAhkUpq_PSvIymGrXVt65A,"Brooklyn, NY",6/20/2013,5,"This is my favorite place! Wish the menu had a wider selection since I've already tried everything on the menu! Love the tuna tartar and lobster fried rice. There isn't anything on their menu that doesn't taste good! Absolutely love! I did leave a gift card with a birthday card here on the table, and when i went back my table was clean and the card was gone!! Unfortunately none of the waiters reported it lost to the front desk - which disappointed me tremendously. When i went back all the staff seemed annoyed to help me look.  Not the greatest service for someone who loves this place so much...but besides that mishap that the food is excellente, and the ambiance is fantastic."
Marwa E.,/user_details?userid=tP02kYUDYp_e9_93NKSFIA,"Manhattan, NY",6/8/2014,5,I highly recommend this restaurant! Delicious food and very romantic atmosphere. Expensive but worth every penny!
Tee B.,/user_details?userid=qjYP0QITFv-CIXjxQGUdRQ,"Manhattan, NY",2/18/2011,5,"Fancy Schmancy??.....NAH....Its just a good ole NYC spot!!! We love it dark and sexy....just be you(without sweats and a baseball cap) and you'll be fine!! I read a few reviews about the workers being stuck up but my experience last night(2/17/11) was anything but. After a harrowing experience at Barney's Warehouse Sale i decided to dive deeper into my dwindling checking account and stop by Buddakan for some grub. Nick, one of the hosts/reservationist was hella cool, gave me a 10pm reservation when i arrived at 9pm but suggested i try for the lounge area. Low and behold i got a seat at the bar and within 5mins a seat at a communal table(sort of like a bougie picnic bench). On to the real shit, the FOOD AND DRINKS!!!!!! I ordered the pork dumplings(yuummmmyyy), the lobster fried rice(oooooohhhh yyyyyeaaaaa) and possibly the best damn chicken ive ever had that wasnt soul food; BROKEN CHILI CHICKEN.....fukkin awesome! The cocktails got me where i needed to be: the Fate(light but deceptive made with pineapple) and the Solid(umm....why do i keep ordering these bourbon infused drinks when i know i'm semi light in the ass?...lol). Overall, i spent $85 bucks on myself and it felt damn good...Buddakan, I am a believer!!!!!"
Evangeline K.,/user_details?userid=lhDQoZrHBcQd_3URe77DFw,"Manhattan, NY",4/19/2011,5,"In the past few months I started making my reservations for this place on opentable and they told me we see this is your 18 visit here, welcome back. I don't know why 18 was the magic number but they treated me like true VIP. I have been to this place maybe 100 times my friends and I love it. The manager there is super sweet and kept our glass of champagne full way after I paid the check because of my 18th visit. I love the food here, the edamame dumplings are to die for. I love that the food comes out when it's ready and since I'm usually starving I can't wait for the food to come. My friends and I usually order a bunch of appetizers to share, and since everything comes out when it's ready it makes it easy to start eating right away and know if you are still hungry it's ok to order more. The place is gorgeous and huge. The check usually comes out to the lower end of $100 for two people and I ordere whatever I want plus some drinks. I think it's a great deal and will definitely be visiting another 18 times."
Eric B.,/user_details?userid=O1oEdrlZYohdtXdJJThbPw,"Overland Park, KS",4/1/2014,5,"Ridiculously beautiful and decadent inside.  Greek/roman architecture and artsy.  Its a sexy place.  Stroll around to see and be seen and check out all of the restaurant and bar because you won't see another like it.  The food and drinks were great.  We the nicest waiter I've seen in a while serving us.  Try a ton of different things on their diverse menu and share among friends.   The prices were lofty, but if you want a great NYC experience, check this place out.  Don't miss their desserts.  Take up their staff recommendations and enjoy this fantastic experience."
Beatrice P.,/user_details?userid=NS8eVnhAZm4mRxbl6SvBIA,"Brisbane, Australia",10/23/2014,5,Amazing one of the best Asian fusion meals I have ever had. The environment was incredible also as we were sitting in the big main dining room. Service was perfect and overall had a very good night
Sophia M.,/user_details?userid=0O_HBRhxb0DKE642Tdl4FA,"East Brunswick, NJ",10/19/2014,5,"The food wast excellent.  We had the lobster egg roll, carrot wonton, lemon chicken and lobster fried rice.  The service was excellent. Can't wait to go there again. The place was beautiful"
J L.,/user_details?userid=ltFjEnf5vN6m_FxIwy6aZA,"Chicago, IL",3/27/2014,3,Good ambiance but for $200 I've had way better experiences at other awesome NYC restaurants. The food and drinks werent that memorable and we left hungry and sober.
L B.,/user_details?userid=Pi2w0DrWNUGAAw6zegTO-g,"Rice, WA",5/27/2014,5,"My daughter lives here and has been here several times so we went last night. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgable. Our food was simply delicious. We had the deviled tuna rolls, spicy spring rolls and general tso's dumplings. Hard to decide which was the best. We had Peking duck and the char beef fillets. So yummy. The duck skin was crispy and not greasy. The beef was generous portion and very tender. But the shining star was the sauce with the beef. Wow!! We usually don't get desert but we had the bread pudding and the dark chocolate with sour cherries yikes!! Both were so decadent and truly worth eating. A fabulous dinner and experience."
Chris W.,/user_details?userid=OY_w8sqegths6ZJfiptvXw,"Manhattan, NY",5/24/2016,5,"we had a birthday here in meatpacking district.  trendy ambience, good food and drinks.  would definitely come back."
Ciro P.,/user_details?userid=ENdEo1YQv6Z-FLUNcAwfxQ,"Babylon, NY",7/28/2014,5,Love this place. I come here all the time. The food is out of this world. I've never had a bad experience. I wish it was close so I can go every night.
A M.,/user_details?userid=nCmcAMfQ_llv-A5IO5lXGQ,"Calgary, Canada",10/9/2014,5,Excellent food and service.  Made reservations for 7:30 pm and we were seated immediately in a nice corner on the main floor.  Great variety. My friend is gluten free and there was a variety for her to choose from.  The Edamame dumplings were lovely.  We were joined for dinner by our friends from Europe.  We all agreed it was one of the best meals we had during our stay and will be back.
Nerissa I.,/user_details?userid=mLJaxn6XmW6nWOku0VRf4Q,"New York, NY",1/12/2009,5,"this place is my new best friend. if i lived/worked closer, i think i might actually be permanent fixture. just don't make a res on saturday night at 1130pm for your birthday... you'll be too hungry to enjoy the food, too deaf to hear your friends and too drunk to remember what happened."
C C.,/user_details?userid=hfVXw316V9IqfHkSSLpW_g,"Sunnyvale, CA",3/14/2014,5,"Great meal. Great ambiance. Exceptional waiter staff. Its pricey but its delicious. Pork belly appetizer was to die for, as was the tuna, and the chili rock shrimp. And save room for the crying chocolate cake. A great meal."
Chris L.,/user_details?userid=-peSWOplbo-9aPt3ZJr8QQ,"New York, NY",3/16/2006,3,"This giant, trendy asian-fusion restaurant will wow you when you first walk in. Everything is somewhat sexy with many sections of the restaurant, each with different themes and decor - the lounge is sleek but gets crowded and loud in the evening, the grand room with its high ceiling, gold colors and grandeur commands your attention but also gets loud as the room fills up...but the best is the quieter, more intimate library with tables surrounded by faux gold colored books, softly lit by lights - we have our favorite table here for six that is comfortable yet interesting in decor - which, by the way, is an odd mix of asian and baroque. The food itself is good - particularly the taro puff lollipops which were served hot with a crispy outside and a warm goey pork filling.  The scallion pancakes with short ribs were more like crispy thin flatbread with braised short ribs and scallion on top - but it was delicious. The lobster dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary though. We also tried the NY strip served with tomatos and crispies - it was good, but again, nothing special. The black cod and the snapper, though typical sounding were actually delicious and well accented by the other complementary aspects of the dish susch as the mushrooms and the radish. In terms of dessert - we ordered the chocolate mille feuille with caramelized banana and a kaffir lime tart that came with some sort of a lime souffle and gelato - I highly recommend the lime dessert because the lime souffle and gelato were irresistable. Overall, I would say that the food was delicious, the decor was interesting, the service could have been more consistent - but I'll give them a break since this is only week 2 - and the experience overall was worth trying - but there are definitely better places to eat. Good place to get a drink and small apps though...!"
James S.,/user_details?userid=hGpyShURS3PXOAvR5lFL2w,"Manhattan, NY",1/28/2012,5,"Hi Five!  This is a gem waiting to be found. I must have walked by ""Buddakhan"" several times not noticing it (it blends in like a cameleon as a part of Chelsea Market). I live right in the neighborhood and it lived up to all expectations. First off, the place in gorgeous inside and the food is even more exquisite. It's not exactly cheap (runs about $50/person), but trust me, the quality and presentation of the food is what you pay for. We ordered the monk fish kung pao and the tuna tatar appetizer. Both were presented beautifully and absolutely delicious. What's even more amazing is how quality is maintained, in spite of the hundreds of people who come here each night, so definitely gets an A for consistency. Definitely the best Asian fusion restaurant I've been to in NYC. Come here with a date, friends, out of town guest, and make sure you dress up as well!"
Amie R.,/user_details?userid=N9I-aB4QJcM6kIint6QQ2w,"Manhattan, NY",4/11/2012,4,"the only reason i can't give buddakan 5 stars is because of of the portion sizes compared to price, but it is MEPA after all! i strongly suggest this as a date spot (thanks guys!) or for a group so you can share everything. in a city where restaurants flop daily, buddakan has maintained its reputation and is still a total (awesome) scene. definitely well deserved as it is such a gorgeous, beautifully decorated, trendy, delicious, MASSIVE restaurant. really the ambiance is just absolutely stunning. food is great but really the only two words you need to know are EDAMAME DUMPLINGS! everytime i have gone i have ordered seconds of these babies. YUM!"
Premal P.,/user_details?userid=YNO7wE1BWz4WhMOs2ejPSg,"Franklin Park, NJ",1/15/2014,2,The ambience was trying too hard to be hip and it didn't work.  The food was ok but not worth the money.  A disappointment overall.
Hencys D.,/user_details?userid=qCjjm-koEEcqUW_H0_LuxQ,"Elmhurst, NY",8/13/2010,5,"I went last night for my Best Friend's Birthday and let me tell you, this place is awesome!!  Very trendy place with a beautiful decor that you will fall in love!!  Great place to go with your other half or a date that you're really into of course!!  Dim lighting, however, there is light over you and a candle votive on each table so you do see what you're eating!!  Lol!!  When you walk down the stairs to the main dining area, you will fall in love again!!  The decor is incredible and the food is spectacular!!  Great taste!!  I'll tell you what we had....Edamame Dumplings (steamed), General Tso's Dumpling, Dungeness Crab Sticky Rice, Spice Tofu and Cashews, my best friend had the Glazed Alaskan Black Cod and I had the Sweet and Crispy Jumbo Shrimp.  For dessert, since it was my best friend's Birthday I requested for him the Crying Chocolate.  The waiter placed a candle and they wrote on the plate with chocolate script handwriting ""Happy Birthday.""  That was really nice. I had the Warm Coconut Custard Cake.  I have no complaints.  Decor, Food and Service was amazing!!"
Ascena S.,/user_details?userid=vE5kEw_Zf2Wli00B4wZo4g,"Maui, HI",8/22/2012,2,"Beautiful Decor and ambiance, however the food did not complement the atmosphere. It was simply mediocre and not worth the price. The pork belly buns were good but did not compare to David Chang."
Vanita K.,/user_details?userid=EbvCc9uvNFo4GRTbVTJ1KA,"PRINCETON JUNCTION, NJ",5/5/2014,5,We were a party of five and had an absolutely fabulous experience here. I had previously been several times to the AC and Philly locations. The menu has some overlap but not all. My favorite is the crispy calamari salad. Though everything we had was so well prepared and flavorful. The ambience is amazing and being in NYC it's so much bigger and incredible. The cocktails were fab too. I had Fate. We happened to get a corner table in the large main chandelier room. I will request this in the future. There are other rooms as well but the main one is most impressive. The music added to the whole effect. Make reservations way ahead. This place fills up fast.
Lola K.,/user_details?userid=IxoaqdGFw6JYgCpM44xxfQ,"Manhattan, NY",9/23/2014,5,"always a terrific experience dining at Buddahakan, the atmosphere and service is like no other. its an nyc must"
Lara C.,/user_details?userid=QY3lKbUUo2IwJeLgA1wtkw,"New York, NY",6/29/2016,3,"We were surprisingly pleased with our meal at Buddakan.  We thought that this popular place may be overrated but that was not the case.  We enjoyed our meal and even took a bag home with the leftover bone for our dog.  The crispy cauliflower lollipops were delicious, ooey, gooey, cheesy savory goodness, however they were logistically challenging to eat, as we couldn't pick up the sticks and eat the crispy fritters as lollipops, we had to pull them off the sticks.  The vegetable fried rice with coconut/pineapple foam/sauce was good, however our plate lacked sufficient coconut/pineapple sauce thus didn't offer us enough of the sweet/savory notes.  The Asian green stir fry was bitingly garlicy, which could be too strong for some.  My husband had the sizzling short rib, which was moist, rich and fulfilling, he thoroughly enjoyed the meal, including the noodles.  Our meal was not flawless but delicious enough that we would give Buddakan another go."
Toni J.,/user_details?userid=Et79VAN692zD2j32PM1E8w,"Near South Side, Chicago, IL",9/27/2010,4,"Hip, Hop hooray.... Just my style.  After traveling for a week on the east coast, hitting up small local places with greasy food, I was desperately looking forward to a nice dinner with some style, I found it!  Starting at Chelsea pier, we walked the elevated park down to the restaurant.  What a spectacular view!   Entering Buddakan we immediately felt like we were in a Sex in the City movie.   We were sat almost right away, we walked through a huge dining room to a smaller area with exposed brick and beams with just the right amount of light.  There were 5 of us, so we decided to all order a dim sum, an entrée and dessert.   That's definitely the way to go.  We couldn't even come close to finishing it all, but it was a great way to try a nice selection of the food.  Everything from the veggie dumplings to the peanut udon noodles with lime sorbet were a piece of art.  All the food came out with an edge, it looked nothing like what you expected, which was a treat.   I had the banana fritters with the pistachio ice cream; it had an overwhelming orange flavor which was surprisingly delicious.  The best part of the experience was finding my new favorite drink, Citrus vodka with lemongrass juice and green tea... I'll be drinking these by the pool for the rest of the summer!"
Cat O.,/user_details?userid=m1wCP0Dla_ulndXZtC20PQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/24/2013,5,"I felt like a vegan queen. Went with a large group and we had the chef's tasting menu. Upon telling the waitress about my vegan diet, she cheerfully said they could accomodate. They brought dish after delicious dish made specifically for me, while the rest of the table enjoyed a more carnivorous menu. Everyone couldn't stop talking about the food, ambiance, and staff. I was blown away."

N J.,/user_details?userid=d8MiR1v98nY8QNBepdml1g,"Mississauga, Canada",6/12/2014,2,"Good food, excellent decor. Our server downstairs by the bar had massive attitude. He said to every table that been working for 9 years and knows his stuff. Would not admit his fault in conveying wrong menu. Completely ignorant while customer is speaking to him. Walks away making a remark. Maybe he had his sense of humour. But did not work for us. Food was good though."
Danny S.,/user_details?userid=Hl0LDG5Z3UrO4geZi04OCw,"Fort Lee, NJ",3/3/2011,5,"Buddakan is sexy...so very very sexy. Buddakan is located on the upper edge of meatpacking on 9th avenue in a seriously inconspicuous building. Walk inside through the doors of the unimpressive structure and completely get transported to a different world. Stylish, trendy, cool, chic; name it, Buddakan is it. Music is played at a very reasonable level so conversation can still be kept but the tone and mood are still right. what really differentiates Buddakan for me though is the friendly service. Its hard to find a friendly face in meatpacking on the weekend, so the great service and smiling faces are a welcome change. The Asian fusion food is really well presented and never disappoints. Another obvious plus is that the main dining room and table were features in Sex and the City, so its always fun to take a fan of the series and the movies here for the first time. Always a good time, always good food and drinks. Come here on any occasion."
bruce s.,/user_details?userid=MVRivbdH6LH1pgrJdnmGig,"Englewood, NJ",12/3/2006,3,Cool vibe - good food....as good as the other hi-end asian fusion places in NYC. certainly suggest trying it.
Adhara M.,/user_details?userid=8Q5Hi9QqspsmV0hSSUv0pg,"San Diego, CA",1/10/2008,4,"It was about time to see what all the fuss is about. I've always liked the whole discrete entrance idea when it comes to unique establishments so I immediately apprecicated the subtlety of the door tucked away just off the corner of 16th St and 9th Ave. We were greeted at a formal counter seperated from the rest of the space, a slightly different concept than your usual restaurant podium. After checking our coats we were escorted to a beautiful corner table in the grand baroque room overlooking the central dining area which was simply spectacular! Buddakan is like many different worlds in one. There are several rooms and spaces of different colors, design and themes that all surround the main dining room made up of high ceilings and gorgeously ornate wooden walls. This week I decided to take an easier approach to ordering from the menu. We faithfully placed everything in our waiter's hands and asked him to select the best Buddakan's cuisine had to offer. Luckily we didn't have any dietary needs which made for a vast selection of options and here is what we got: Shrimp Dumplings filled with Egg Drop Broth, Scallions and Bamboo Shoots, this appetizer was incredible. The broth was like a tasty soup hiding inside the dumpling filled with rich flavor. My second favorite appetizer was the Tuna Spring Rolls with Crisp Shallots and Chili Mayonnaise, they were delicious. The entree that I enjoyed the most was the Charred Fillet of Beef with Wanton Potatoes and Mustard Sauce. The meat was excellent and the sauce made it almost taste like candy. Overall I was definitely satisfied with my experience at Buddakan. Our server was charming and as I said before, the space was like a colorful and lounge- like maze. Although the best part was seeing Hiro Nakamura there, one of my favorite characters from the television hit, 'Heroes', almost better than dessert."
Lynne L.,/user_details?userid=v5WyS5H0modaOUcN_1Uhgg,"Franklin, WI",4/15/2012,5,"What a great place. Just loved the atmosphere. It was a perfect place to bring my friend to on her first NY visit. Each dish was better than the last. We tried the edamame dumplings, spicy pork dumplings, short rib appetizer, and soft shelled crab dinner. We shared it all and has some sake as well. I will definitely try to come back next time I am in NY."
Carolina C.,/user_details?userid=twQ9ucLh3aUWYCkTJx8n3Q,"New York, NY",6/4/2014,5,"Great food and ambiance. I recommend sitting at the bar for a couple drinks and then order the lobster spring rolls, sticky rice, and jumbo shrimp. Absolutely delicious!!"

mayumi m.,/user_details?userid=xEau7v05XgHvzidsbiambw,"New York, NY",3/16/2006,4,"this place is beautiful!!! and very VERY big. i mean, it could probably feed a whole army and then some. i had a reservation around 6, and since it was on the early side, it wasnt as crowded as by the time we left. I had a beautiful seat at the library room. its chinese food with japanese and some french influences here and there. i absolutely adored the edamame dumplings wich was just a burst of delicious in my mouth. i thought the food could have been better though. it didnt blow my mind. (i agree with Chris L. on this part) i was blessed with a wonderful server, and she was very attentive. i really loved my cocktail Serenity...it was very delicious. on the end note, deffinetlly give it a try. the place it self will blow you away, but some of the dishes are not worth what they're charging."

Susie F.,/user_details?userid=WKyiCgkH9YvYoy8qdS3Ltg,"Manhattan, NY",7/30/2014,5,I love this place. They have a gorgeous bar area where you wait for your table and having a drink here is as much a part of the experience as the meal for me! I have been here for a couple of special occasions and it is a true dining experience. The food is pricey but they have great suggestions for sharing some different courses so it works out worth the money for really delicious and interesting food.

From the atmosphere, to the friendliness of the staff, to the food - a definite 5 stars.  We were a party of 10 and decided to try the pre-fixe menu.  They brought out so much food that we had no more room for dessert, but we still had it.  Every plate that came to the table was better than the one before.  Highly recommend the pre-fixe."
Amit M.,/user_details?userid=vhwMqCp8NK9-SQs6IJlqEA,"Studio City, CA",5/9/2014,5,Buddakan is my favorite restaurant in NYC! The food and service are always top notch.  This place is quintessential NYC - I love the hotel lobby style check-in.  This place is definitely worth a visit if you are in the mood for Chinese/Asian fusion and perfect for a light dinner before going out.  It is on the pricier side but worth every penny IMO!
Dawn A.,/user_details?userid=m5MeTkNrQ_fzbmwrFYocFw,"New York, NY",12/5/2008,4,"I have been here several times for happy hour, romantic dinner, large party and Buddakan never disappoints.  Great food and (almost always) good service.  My favorite room is the library with the gold books.  I have never seen anyone trip on the stairs although that would be a sight.  Recommendation - order the whole fried fish... I don't even like fish and it was AWESOME.  One complaint - coat check almost lost my sherling, but it was recovered."
Tennille S.,/user_details?userid=dQZgnulMOEZo_g0zWlyRlg,"Sydney, Australia",7/17/2014,5,This has to be my favourite restaurant in New York. We've been there at least 10 times and it truly is amazing.

The person who set it up was nice but the people who helped us checkin were very rude.

Michael J.,/user_details?userid=S1bWCv6aV_2wlWYMxrfHvQ,"Bronx, NY",3/13/2012,4,"I decided to take a friend here for his 30th birthday to celebrate, I made reservations surprisingly it had a really good crowd for a Monday evening. We were seated quickly, and given ample time to look over the menu. We ordered the scalion pancakes  for an appetizer which were a tad salty and greasy. The drinks were cute however none of the signature cocktails were strong, more so sweet and danty. When it cametime to order the main course I decided to order chicken as the last time I dined there I ordered from the seafood menu and was disappointed in the portions of the food. I ordered the the Broken Chili chicken $22, lobster fried rice $16, which we shared the rice. The chicken was a bit salty and not spicy at all for something with chili in the name.  Needless to say 1. I was diappointed in the portion of the food for the money they charge one piece of chicken is not sufficient the rice bowl was no where near full. My friend decided to go with something from the meat portion of the menu the sizzling short rib $26 which was tastey and I would say a sufficient portion. Dessert was good and a sweet ending with Happy Birthday written on the plate and a candle. The overall ambiance of the restaurant is very nice. However they need to up the game on their food portions VERY disappointing for such a well known 5 star restaurant."

Kaylee P.,/user_details?userid=MtaqCfjWRQrKNwUp3e6x-Q,"Boulder, CO",7/3/2014,5,"This is a fantastic restaurant with an even better staff. Upon arriving we ran into a wait list. The host suggested the lounge area which was awesome. The atmosphere in the lounge is as creative and fun as the rest of the building. Our server, Sarah, was so wonderful! She gave us top notch service and really made our experience. We took her suggestion with some of the food choices, which did not disappoint! She was so attentive and made the evening fun. The manager, Timothy, made a point to come check on us and ensure we were having a good experience, which is always a plus. The food was absolutely incredible! Adequately priced considering location and quality. We were satisfied with 3 sharing plates and a salad (deviled tuna tartare, steamed seabass spring rolls, oxtail dumplings and peking duck salad). YUM! We will definitely return and ask for Sarah! Thank you guys"

Everything was delicious. Loved the tuna tartare spring rolls, the rock shrimp, etc. You are allowed to swap in different appetizers if you prefer something else. There was more than enough food to go around. Highly recommend!!!"

The bar  is  jumping, the food is really good, ""fancy chinese"".  The edamame dumplings are my favorite dish. The lobster dish was  great  but they took it off the menu recently, what a mistake  that was.  They make you wait a long time to seat you ,  they like getting you to order drinks at the bar. It's a place you must experience."
Janet D.,/user_details?userid=zUMxNO6nBvRvbwj8P0H_XA,"Bronx, NY",12/7/2012,4,Attentive reception. Impressive decor. On-time seating. And the food ... it was a party in my mouth. An explosion of flavor. Great dining experience!
Carmen E.,/user_details?userid=24A7PF2zNhT3fL4cU5Qf5A,"Manhattan, NY",12/24/2010,4,I love this nostolgic sex and the city hot spot. Very posh and fancy. The restaurant is huge with great interior design.  Food can get expensive but so tasty! Their drinks are super yummy esp the Martini's. Great place to hang out with girlfriends and birthdays parties are popular here. I recommend all their appetizers.

Annie P.,/user_details?userid=B2KAKU0oKB4cSii0SDSR9Q,"Manhattan, NY",12/3/2013,2,"We could have had way better dishes elsewhere for the price we paid. The place would look better with a little less dark, and the servers were attentive enough. We order 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, and we were not pleased with any. Maybe I had my expectation held too high because of what I heard about it. But for what I paid for, it was a total disappointment."

Amol P.,/user_details?userid=B4Rwp0SUYwO8lgSHVT9w5g,"Seattle, WA",9/19/2011,2,"We had a reservation here at 10 PM on a thu night. We arrived on time but they were running behind so we were forced to wait for a bit which did not help the cause since we were super hungry ... The place is loud and noisy ... it almost had a tao like feel... we were beginning to lose patience but luckily a table opened up and we were finally seated .. what followed thereafter in terms of service was pathetic. First off our server did not stop by to take our order despite reminding the staff to send someone over .. finally when they did we felt rushed to place our order .. we ordered the edamame dumplings and jade shrimp for appetizers .. i did not get to taste the edamame dumplings but the reactions on the faces did not seem very promising .. We ordered the kung pao monkfish(2 *) , crab sticky rice (2 *) and the silken tofu (1 *) with the vegetable fried rice with coconut curry foam (1 *) .. worst part was that the kitchen forgot about our ticket and we were served 45 minutes later which was frustrating to say the least ... the dessert (almond bread pudding) was the saving grace though ... I am really unsure how this place is so popular .. the food is meh ... service sucks .. the real test of character is how the service scales with the number of customers and unfortunately buddakan fell flat on that front .. the hype definitely did not live upto it's promise worse yet the restaurant staff did not even have the courtesy to make up for the delay in serving our food ... we left the place without paying any tip .. it was that disgusting an experience with the service offered to us ..."
Tina W.,/user_details?userid=M5jmGTQx6l8RWzM3wxIfbw,"Brooklyn, NY",5/4/2013,4,"A girlfriend and I came here on a Friday night at 11pm. The place was still buzzing with people, drinking, eating and conversing. The decor is beautiful, like a very modern Chinese mansion in a club like atmosphere with cut out walls, displays of stuffed birds and neon colors. We're seated and start looking over the menu. I order a cocktail, solid - with bourbon, ginger and orange. It was good. On appetizers we decided on the duck salad and tuna spring roll. The salad could have used a touch more salt on the greens, but the duck itself was great. The tuna tasted really fresh and the spring roll skin was crunchy, it was awesome. For Entrees we shared filet of beef, kung pao monkfish and wild mushroom chow fun. The beef came med, when I ordered it med rare, but it was still tender and juicy nonetheless. The chow fun tasted good, yet it was also cooked it little over, the noodles were clumping together. The monkfish was my favorite! It was sweet, tart and spicy and the fish was cooked perfectly. Presentation on everything was nice. The menu is so huge, I have to come back and try the rest."
Sayjul P.,/user_details?userid=dWuMx2NWdC5cVZZ_7B9Bhg,"Raleigh, NC",3/6/2011,2,After all the hype I had heard about Buddakan I have to say I was disappointed after my first visit to this restaurant.  The decor was the best part about the whole experience.  We had made reservations in advance and showed up on time.  We were promptly seated at a wonderful table and the ambiance was lovely.  We ordered a few drinks which were tasty and creative.  We were determined to try as many dishes as we could and ordered a variety of appetizers.  The Hoisin Glazed Pork Belly was the best dish we had.  We also ordered a variety of main dishes and they were underwhelming as well.  Nothing really stood out for us and I have to the say the Chinese Sausage Fried Rice was the best tasting dish we had.  Although the menu was creative the flavors were not what we expected.  I was expecting for that WOW moment and it never came.  The service was great but the food was no where near what we expect from such a high praised establishment.  I had my Buddakan experience and unfortunately it probably will be my last.
Anthony P.,/user_details?userid=-byBGQ-TYIW6-GYVewTEkg,"Brooklyn, NY",2/21/2012,5,Love this place!! Went on a sat night and had a great dinner. We walked in about ten mins early and checked our coats and were promptly seated. I love the menu here they have alot of interesting choices. They serve it family style in that whatever dishes you order they just keep bringing them out. We ordered three apps to try. Boneless spareribs first were great. We next had edamame dumplings that were very nice also had chili rock shrimp and they were very good as well. They cleared the table and reset for entrees. We ordered filet of beef which is prob one of the most conservative items on the menu(wifes choice i would never order that here). The filet of beef was done very nicely and was very good. I ordered the kung pao monkfish which was fantastic and i cant wait to have it again. We also ordered the minced pork lo mein. It had pickled cucumbers in it and we loved it. Cant wait to get that lo mein again too. For dessert we had the bread pudding thats comes with whisky ice cream it was very nice. We also had an espresso and a latte that were very good. The service was very good and pleasant and the food was excellent. The restaurant is dimley lit and grand. The main room is an incredible space for sure. Cant wait to go back love it.
Robyn R.,/user_details?userid=goE-jPN6j28zTeYHrd7Ntg,"Sacramento, CA",5/15/2012,5,"I could come here every single day and enjoy a Tranquility (citrus vodka and lemongrass-infused oolong tea) and the tuna tartare spring rolls and be the happiest person alive.  Throw in the edamame dumplings (which are beyond anything the name could conjure up) and the lobster and shrimp chow fun and you could convince heaven exists and I am in it.  The menu is so extensive from drinks to dim sum to main dishes to dessert that you would be remiss to not try everything you could even though you have favorites that you crave the moment you leave your table.  the decor is stunning, from the Moorish cut out doorways and enormous vases that could have been cut from said doorways to the chandelier-draped dining room with the extremely high ceilings.  Our server was knowledgeable, sweet, and attentive as was the rest of the staff.  No sooner do you finish a dish than a suited gentleman who could be the secret service whisks away your plate to make room for the next course.  The sea bass roll was mild to the taste but I love that.  The broken chili chicken is not spicy but still lovely.  The snap peas and candy-crusted Mongolian lamb chops rounded out a fantasy birthday meal.  And the desserts, which I'm shocked we had room for, the Crying Chocolate and Almond Bread Pudding, I'm pretty sure only existed in my dreams until Saturday night.  The only question is, when I return can I break from my pattern of ordering what I already know I love to explore their other offerings...we shall see...."
Gregory C.,/user_details?userid=CFtCdyGi319TOBaSG8x4qg,"Marin, CA",9/2/2013,3,"What a Zoo....bit of a joke but hey why knock success at near $20 Mil in sales.  We waited for a table in the bar where I got to see quite a few dishes.  Most looked Americanized and cloying in sweet spicy sauces...and cocktails were passable, certainly no real mixology here.  We ordered three app's and only one passable was the lobster-crab dumpling which was served with the omnipresent Samal Olek chili sauce (I think straight out of the original plastic tubs)...the boneless ribs way to sweet and only had a smidgen of Douban bean sauce...the painting of mustard on the white side of the plate was comical.  The other app, the scallion pancakes with shredded dark mystery meat (beef) was soooo salty we sent it back.  The mains were not much better...Kungpao Monkfish was lukewarm where as the long beans were cold!  The Mao Pao (funny-spelling) tofu was passable but misses the real numbing heat of the green peppercorns (missing).  Service was excellent as server was friendly and accommodating.  He added a Star to this rating.  The atmosphere is a knockoff of the original Buddha Bar (Paris) and mesh-mash of other Asian venues but generally appeals to a mid-Americain NYC wow visitor.  America needs the real deal....someone please open a real Asian/Chinese bistro cum club if you will."

Nicky L.,/user_details?userid=_1y_nCO5rI0X8-7G1muacQ,"Bronxville, NY",1/12/2012,5,"5 ladies went for my friend's birthday dinner.  They wont seat you until the entire party arrives but they have a great lounge area and as soon as your party arrives ( no matter how long they take) they accommodate you right away .. and with a smile.b  We checked our coats and they sat us at the communal table ( the sex and the city rehearsal dinner table)  At first we were like great this is going to suck but they space everyone out so you weren't sitting on top of each other.  Drinks were good. I have the charm and i really enjoyed it! We ordered to Bo Bo platter which has two of everything so its not filling if you just want to sample apps its great.  For the entrees we ordered the sizzling short rib, Broken chili chicken, Sweet and crispy jumbo shrimp, lobster fried rice, and vegetable rice with curry foam.  Everything was delish.  I know people say that Buddakan is a upscale PF changs but i would say that's like saying dos caminos or rosa mexicana is an upscale taco bell. Um....obviously because its in the same food genre it can be compared but honestly there is no comparison in the quality and ambiance and service. That's a silly comparison. There's not much fancier you can get with Asian food than places like buddakan.  Dessert was AMAZING.    We ordered the crying chocolate, almond bread pudding, and the clementine cloud... yummo! Overall it was a great experience and my friend thoroughly enjoyed her b-day dinner."

The food was delicious and the decor was nicely done. The server forgot my order when he brought out everyone's dinner & I sat there waiting for awhile assuming it would eventually come. Once I notified the staff about 20minutes later, they immediately brought out my dinner. The manager even came over to apologize & actually removed it from the bill. I cannot say enough about the food & service here! There were 8 of us & I enjoyed everything everyone ordered."
Juan R.,/user_details?userid=TQ0hryAlWQuRsX27stO_9w,"Manhattan, NY",11/25/2013,2,"We arrived 10 mins late due to parking. We still waited standing for over an hour for our table. The waitstaff was polite and knowledgable of the menu. The waitstaff was not patient with us we felt rushed to order. Waitress came back to our table several times to ask if we were ready to order. The food came out as it was ready so it never seemed like we were all eating at the same time. The waitress never came back to ask us if everything was ok or if everyone received the correct order. There was also confusion on the part of the staff as to who ordered what?. Plates were placed at the center of the table for us to figure out. There was no sense of urgency we were celebrating a birthday and our birthday girl didn't feel special. I wanted to order another appetizer and I had to order it through one of the food runners delivering our food due to the waitress not being fully attentive to us. We ordered dessert and coffee when she finally came back around. Waitress never asked us how was our dinning experience so far. The dessert came our birthday girl did recieve a very nice dessert I didn't check on the bill if it was complimentary. The bill arrived before the final course did. It seemed like every employee that passed wanted the bill. I was asked on 4 different occasions by 4 different people if the bill was ready. We felt rushed once again. We paid our $600 plus bill and walked to the bathroom. Upon exiting the bathrooms we stopped for pictures at the large mural in the bathroom area. We had a man behind us the whole time I don't know if he was security. He kept saying ""guys let's wrap this up and move you guys upstairs and to the exit"" it could of been nothing but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. This man walked behind us all the way to the exit wich was kind of creepy people in my party were bothered by this. Overall we had a good time it is a very nice place and a great place to look at beautiful people. The food was not anything to die for I described it as glorified Chinese food. Slightly over priced. Glad it's over probably won't return here and I won't recommend it. I have been in the F&B business I have worked at Le Cirque and for chef Daniel Boulud. Knowing the industry from the inside like I do I just feel there were to many no no's. Thank you for taking the time to read this."

Vanni P.,/user_details?userid=hFvCZeTjMQqmzpKnKAbfeA,"San Jose, CA",8/7/2012,5,"Could Buddakan be the best Asian fusion restaurant in NYC? I, for one, would not be scandalized if somebody suggested that was the case - it's that good. After having some excellent drinks at the bar while waiting for our table (mezcal jalapeno), we were ready to enjoy some serious food at 10:30pm. One of our team members was vegetarian, so we ordered edamame dumplings, carrot dumplings, and the 2 vegetarian tofu dishes. Add on top of that the lobster spring rolls, the glazed pork belly, the filet, the soft shell tempura crab and a noodle soup. The result is bliss. Everything was excellent, but the edamame dumplings (mashed with truffle undertones), the soft shell tempura crab (crispy delish), the glazed pork belly (mouth-wateringly fatty scrumptious), and the filet (usa that mustard-mayo sauce) were just over the top amazing. Excellent wine list too, though on the expensive side. Service could not be faulted. And the ambiance has just the right amount of pre-party vibe leading up to a crazy night in the MePa. Bring adventurous out-of-towners to impress."

I arrived early and was seated in the lounge and attended to by Samantha who waited on me like a VIP. I will say it was the friendliest restaurant I have been in while in NYC. I was treated like a king, the food was great as always. Absolutely no doubt there. The Maitre 'D , Lee Ann, was very accomodating and one of the friendliest human beings I encountered while in NYC that day. I am a commercial actor and stylist and come into NYC on occasion for auditions and other business. Samantha treated me like a weary traveler, immediately offered me a simple glass of ice water which is what I needed most desperately on a day that was surprisingly the hottest day so far this year. My guest joined me a little later and the great treatment started all over again. She was genuinely complimented by the staff. They gave us a cozy little spot as requested. I was proud of the great service provided. I am a Philly guy and know the Starr organization quite well. Job well done. Thank you!"

After we got drinks and about ten minutes passed, we were taken to our seats. The whole place looks really nice and well decorated. We had the friendliest waiter and he really knew a lot about the menu which is important since I want to know about what I am eating and what's best to order. The food tasted great, we got a bunch of appetizers since it was too late at night for whole entres. We were served quickly and everything was delicious, especially crying chocolate for dessert!"
Luis C.,/user_details?userid=5A6gFWXGEvVpmCupKXlBNA,"Queens, NY",3/10/2013,5,"My first experience here I had some service issues, but second time around was terrific. I recommend requesting a seat in the lower level of the restaurant if you would like a quieter dining experience. Our waitress was terrific with great recommendations. We had to start the popular edamamae dumplings which texture wise remind me of mashed potatoes in a dumpling, but the taste gets me over my texture issue. We had the tuna tartare spring rolls which are super delicious and I highly recommend.  We had the chilled udon noodles with a delicious sorbet in the middle. The noodles were absolutely delicious and I would have never ordered that unless our waitress didn't push us to. She was great. As our mains we had the delicious lamb chops that were crusted with a nutty crust, super yummy.  We also had the monk fish which was spicy, super tasty and delicious. For dessert we had a delicious coconut grilled cake with a passion fruit gelatin that was so good, but my favorite dessert was the crying chocolate it was a OH MY GOD delicious malted chocolate ganache souffle with a vietnamese coffee ice cream with spots of caramel and chocolate on the plate, I literally wanted to lick that plate clean. SO GOOD!!! I would highly recommend coming here and picking your servers brain on what to get if you haven't dined here before, The service was terrific, I will be back."
Siobhan S.,/user_details?userid=FgnkCUAPPJmxwVKnpXTEEw,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",12/6/2017,3,"now let me start by saying the food here is not why im complaining, their tuna tartare spring rolls would probs be my death row meal. the one thing i will never understand about this restaurant(having visited multiple times) is the asinine  way they seat people. we waited nearly an hour past our reservation time with zero explanation as to why, even when i called to inform them we were ten minutes behind because of the worlds slowest cab driver i was told it wasn't a problem and our table would be ready when we got there. we proceeded to sit in the nearly pitch black, overcrowded and frankly claustrophobic atmosphere of their ""lounge"" for the better part of an hour watching hostesses wandering aimlessly around clearly looking for their tables with little to no avail before i decided to ask(and as someone who works in the restaurant industry i know how stressful it can get) so if we had simply been told that they were totally slammed with large parties and were running behind(something i deduced for myself during our wait while trying not to steal the spring rolls of the plate of the people next to us) it wouldn't have been a problem but nothing was said, no apology was made until we got to the table and our super friendly waiter. i love those spring rolls but that experience may have put me off ever going back."
Dmitry S.,/user_details?userid=lXaT-WCwXZrCL6n14AmwJQ,"Brooklyn, NY",9/18/2013,4,"Really cool place with a great vibe.  Food was good with medium sized portions.  Shee pooh pooh interior design with friendly staff.  Funky drinks for a mere introductory price of $15 but who cares, your at Buddakan."
woody w.,/user_details?userid=UuL98Hkd3a5fg5Lk_7g3hQ,"Woodside, NY",9/14/2013,3,"I have had good experience at this restaurant until last time. Food is always good especially appetizers. However, service was really bad. My server was too busy to answer my question. We ask him for his recommendation for seafood  entrée. He recommended chow fun lobster which we followed and lamb. A minute later, my friend want to change to Cod fish instead. We asked him to change it but he said that they out of the Cod fish and insist that chow fun was really good. If we did not like it he would not charge. Then the food came and my friend did not like it at first bite. We did not touch that dish and asked him to return it. He was not happy with that. Then we had a manager came to the table and asked if there's anything wrong with the food. We told him what's going on and he asked which dish we like. My friend told him that he really want to try Cod fish and he brought us Cod fish. What does it mean? We should have told the manager how this server take care customer. He did not do what customer want and offer comp if customer do not like. I would not write about this if there was not a lie from him."
Sydney K.,/user_details?userid=rfQF3LD4c2w7Drys591ZZQ,"Manhattan, NY",5/9/2013,5,"Hot, trendy, amazing food and wonderful service! I don't always go for the ultra trendy restaurants in the city, but wanted to take a friend, who was in town, somewhere fun. Buddakan definitely exceeded my expectations. Food wise I highly recommend the tuna tartare spring rolls, they were to die for. The Cantonese steamed sole was delicious as well, very fresh and extremely flavorful. The service was outstanding, I did not love the first cocktail I tried and the waiter insisted on bringing me something else. Our fish came out 5 minutes before the side dishes we ordered, which we were fine (we thought it was suppose to happen this way), but the waiter was completely embarrassed and apologized profusely. We then had two managers come to check on our meal and apologize again for the timing of the dishes, in addition they provided dessert on the house to make up for it!. Living and dining in NYC you don't always expect he highly attentive and customer-focused level of service that Buddakan exemplifies, which makes it all the more wonderful when you come across it."
Susan M.,/user_details?userid=i25fSKP64HLq-DydKko5rw,"New York, NY",11/19/2013,2,"Nice looking place but, unfortunately, it's a factory, not a restaurant for anyone who wants good food for their money. Interesting ideas for their dishes, but execution and delivery of most dishes was mediocre to poor. Lamb chops with crystalized ginger and accompanying bok choy were served cold and tasteless. Fried rice with Chinese sausage tasted like leftovers. Wild mushroom chow fun...tasted like salt. I don't know who was cooking when we were there last weekend, but I say if you want to go to Buddakan, go for a drink and dumplings in the bar area (the carrot dumplings are adorable and tasty). Don't take a chance on ruining a special dinner, like we did."
Russ F.,/user_details?userid=wUgvDotCMlCrNMyjXGN2jg,"Los Altos Hills, CA",4/25/2013,5,"Everything was excellent.  We had Peking Duck, special dumplings, sweet sausage fried rice and crispy prawns.  Service was outstanding too.  Must visit if your in New York."
Randy M.,/user_details?userid=JU-VqFalH1_lFcdczksoSA,"Bloomfield Hills, MI",8/30/2013,4,"Great food, great atmosphere (except for the fact I was dining with my elderly parents), and a great crowd.  Is it the best food in the city, no.  Was the entire experience worth it, Yes!"
A. S.,/user_details?userid=TkO3UfWZwwfZHMGg_qI3mw,"Boston, MA",1/2/2009,3,"Was there just before new years (9pm). Fancy place. Fortunately, no outside waiting. The place is huge. Gorgeous main dining hall. We didn't really order anything besides drinks, which we got for free because we had a hook up in the joint. Some guy who was watching the entrance to the VIP lounge was a total douchebag (even when we were allowed to go down there). Not really my kinda place honestly."
Sloane W.,/user_details?userid=0Vyr9tiJNA3LzFl_Y7pYog,"Tenafly, NJ",1/22/2010,4,"Anyone who has eaten at Buddakan knows that many of their dishes are spectacular, but what is even more impressive is their space. They've taken a virtually windowless 16,000 square foot environment and turned it into one of the most extraordinary interiors in the city. Dark, cavernous and hip with a splash of bridge-and-tunnel, a night at Buddakan is sure to impress whoever you're with. The only thing worth noting is that many of the portions are very small considering the high prices. But their peking duck is an exception to the rule - it was big and fantastic."
Diana G.,/user_details?userid=OetFOoP8avql4-nUgEysYw,"Los Angeles, CA",1/4/2011,5,"Went for my birthday with a party of 8.  I preordered the tasting menu with paired wines recommended by their event planner.  My whole experience was great.  The actual restaurant is beautiful, the service was excellent and the food was amazing.  It was a wonderful night yet we were rushed through dinner.  The food kept coming before we got a chance to finish the previous platter.  At one point it was a bit overwhelming.  I would still recommend it since it was such a great night."
Lisa D.,/user_details?userid=wcLnrZFsPWfuRRxSyJPAug,"New York, NY",1/30/2011,4,"I have been here a few times and everytime has been a great experience. The cocktail ""fate"" is amazing. It comes ""up"" but I always order it on the rocks and I often crave it! I also ALWAYS order the edamame dumplings. They are the most delicious thing on the menu that I've had so far. All of the food is very good... some of the main courses on the tasting menu are just ok (chicken dishes) but overall I am a fan!"
Jennifer P.,/user_details?userid=Bb91vcfkeF5Jb_30N6OAww,"Phoenix, AZ",2/14/2011,4,"Beautiful and hip as stated below.  The filet was phenomenal, but I found the rest of the food just good.  (We also had edamame dumplings, lobster/shrimp chow fun, and chocolate dessert)"
melanie l.,/user_details?userid=auTv42WYJTgJCKlD_XNSxA,"South San Francisco, CA",2/16/2011,5,"totally loved this restaurant.  when i visit ny again, this will be on my must list.  while waiting for our table we waiting in the bar area.  i even discovered a cocktail that was tasty and refreshing is called the saketini, it has cucumber vodka and sake.  it was delicious.  everything we ordered was amazing.  the flavors were very vibrant and kept me wanting more.  if my stomach and my pockets could endure it, i could've eaten forever."

Cindy E.,/user_details?userid=FBzxdSWmzgDHn5WUoGDHEA,"San Diego, CA",6/4/2011,1,"Decent food, trendy vibe, HORRIBLE service. Our waiter apparently did not understand how to work a credit card machine. Our party of 9, out to celebrate a bridal shower, had a total bill of $550, and the guy (Owen) actually tried to get away with charging us about $1200. When we called him out on it, he went back to supposedly ""fix"" it, and came back 30 minutes later with ANOTHER incorrect charge on our credit cards. So now, we're sitting here with two large debits, and he has yet to produce proof that either were reversed/voided. By this time, we've been trying to pay our bill for over an hour (he never even came back to pick up the check the first time... we had to track him down), so we get a manager involved. HE apparently knew how to work a computer and produced proper charges, but we STILL continued to sit around waiting on those void slips. All said & done, we didn't get out of there until more than 2 hours after we'd finished eating, management offered nothing to appease our obviously irritated group (other than to offer us each ""A"" drink), some members of our group were forced to leave without proof of the debit reversals, and the night had been ruined for our bride-to-be... we were all dressed up with no where to go at this point. Will NEVER return, and would NOT recommend to anyone. Forgot to mention that the waiter actually had the audacity to tell one of our friends (a doctor, mind you) to ""behave."" How DARE he?"
Jessica H.,/user_details?userid=sNCx592SA0kbj5newunQsg,"Manhattan, NY",6/5/2011,2,"Meh, it definitely wasn't worth it. The food was ok but not great, small portions. I won't go back."

Gene E.,/user_details?userid=IF-zB7Cf72ABdB0jCDBsrg,"New York, NY",2/13/2012,5,"Food, ambiance, service...This place is SICK. Go for the $65 tasting menu."
Stella L.,/user_details?userid=u8dZ5zlQKgRQHVRD1Y-Vug,"New York, NY",5/24/2012,3,"The interior is beautiful and the waitstaff is cordial but the food is underwhelming. Maybe I was expecting too much or maybe it was the rainy weather but the food was just good and not as amazing as I had hoped. We got the chili rock shrimp because of all of the rave reviews but it is honestly just deep fried shrimp pieces (more breading than shrimp) and lots of mayo. The edamame dumplings  tasted more like some sort of cheese dumpling. It was good but just as good as any cheese ravioli can be and nothing amazing. I would recommend the Alaskan cod  which was perfectly cooked and came with a really good and unique black bean relish. The Black Bean Silken Tofu with kabocha squash, shiitake mushroom, and shishito pepper was good but a bit salty. We also got the Sugar Snap Peas with wild mushrooms and soy tapioca which was also good but overly sauced. Overall, I feel like they use very fresh ingredients but the seasoning and/flavors are lacking. The tofu cheesecake for dessert was really light and delicious. It came slightly deconstructed with an extra graham cracker crust mashed on the side. This place does okay for Asian fusion but I feel like you can go to better places in NYC for good Asian food."
Urban D.,/user_details?userid=3YWwTqaaz-IzL8USBr9JGw,"Manhattan, NY",6/19/2012,5,"I went there last night for the first time and LOVE it!

Will be going back!"
Rick M.,/user_details?userid=nqr5MAVezd3G3aVHBUsbjw,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",10/5/2012,4,Went for a birthday party and wanted to hate it a little because the crowd wasn't my style but I have to say that the food was so good that I didn't care about the crowd. Waiters took care of our party of 12 no problem. We got the 3rd tasting menu and literally everything on it was spectacular. Expensive but oh so good.
Adam F.,/user_details?userid=v_-LBzUa0ldTJtBwooIRbg,"Jupiter, FL",11/6/2012,5,Speechless.  Absolutely speechless.  Won't be that great for you because you did not have my beautiful dining partner with you but you can always try!  :)
Albert H.,/user_details?userid=rwLgmaEnljIRAqDkXxDfCA,"New York, NY",12/2/2012,4,"multiple failed dates here, but like this place a lot. great decor. ""asian fusion"" fare that isn't so bad."

Michael B.,/user_details?userid=mGu_UaupWJ_-jUVowGIHYQ,"Brooklyn, NY",1/24/2013,1,"By far the most incompetent management in the city this evening. The wait to pick up one's checked coat was over 20 minutes. The line was probably 70 people deep. And after the wait, having handed them my ticket, they had no record of my coat. They needed a lengthy description and another 5 minutes scouring their closet. And at the end, not even an apology. As a former regular, I won't be returning regardless of the need to check a coat."
R B.,/user_details?userid=qPJksjVeGNqMYEaPvw98Qg,"San Francisco, CA",3/4/2013,5,"This place is fantastic.  We were seated within 10 minutes on a Saturday night, even though we were extraordinarily late for our reservation.  The ""reflection"" cocktail is really juicy without being cloying and the food was exceptional.  We had the hoisin pork belly buns, Singapore chili crab and sizzling short ribs.  The flavors were perfectly balanced and I was very impressed by the service.  Also, the style of this place is exceptional-- I would come back just for the ambience."
H Z.,/user_details?userid=94XObxU5pShZTCD1nRLdVw,"KEW GARDENS, NY",3/21/2013,4,"I went here for my birthday a few years ago with my family after we went bar hopping in the meatpacking district. In all honesty, we just wanted some dessert. And oh boy, we were in for a treat. Nevermind the scene from Sex and the City movie, Buddakan is still chic. Tao started to become like Jersey so its best to go to the authentic places in the city now. The decor was so trendy and the service was exceptional. For what Im paying, Im expecting this kind of service."
Nick S.,/user_details?userid=ya9ZEAnfgW4dgDbChy0-Zw,"ASTORIA, NY",12/9/2013,5,I was amazed of this place décor. A wait time was a bit longer  then expected but it was worth the wait. the food was delicious and the atmosphere was excellent.

Yuliana P.,/user_details?userid=nWI1V-pARQTJzEWqhmqVrA,"Manhattan, NY",5/6/2013,5,"My favorite resto in NYC. Great ambience, decor, service. The food is really amazing. I order the same food every time and i can eat it again and again. Edamame dumplings is a must! Peking duck and crispy shrimps are amazing. The best dessert is banana cake. Every time I go there I feel full and satisfied."
Key H.,/user_details?userid=bUhgK1FV7m_IsSMvOOy6Ew,"Brooklyn, NY",4/29/2013,3,"It was okay. The appetizers were the best part of the meal we ordered boneless spare ribs,chili rock shrimp and sesame shrimp toast. For dinner I had Sweet and Crispy Jumbo shrimp they were okay with steamed white rice the rice was so dry ugh. The other guest had the lobster rice complained the lobster tasted like it was not fresh but frozen. They paired it with 1. Sizzling short rib, 2. Mongolian lamb chops and 3. Broken chili chicken. Everything was just mediocre maybe we just had too high of expectations. For drinks we ordered Hennessy on the rocks, patron sun rise (I think they forgot to put the patron in mine), and patron margarita (again I think they were short on patron or something taste like juice). I will not go back besides the food was mediocre but service was horrible the waiter took 20mins to take drink orders and disappeared for half an hour to take food orders if the food is not good at least have good service. Plus he had a sarcastic attitude every time we spoke to him."
Vania G.,/user_details?userid=9g-b3UQZpUUz_G8Rbmvw8A,"Manhattan, NY",6/17/2013,4,The food was good. I found the restaurant way too large to enjoy. Soo many floors and doors and what nots. It is a nice place to show off for Chinese but not really a repeat offender.
Jonathan F.,/user_details?userid=HjsGVAk70nhOGYMdh_9OAA,"New York, NY",6/16/2013,4,"Went here recently for a little get together.  Always a great vibe at this joint.  My party really enjoyed the chili rock shrimp, edamame dumplings, pork belly sliders, crying chocolat, and the bread pudding.  All of us (4 guys) almost cried at how good the bread pudding was.  The bourbon cocktail was a real crowd pleaser.  Entrees were good too, but the apps and desserts were our favorite."

Fawn V.,/user_details?userid=okylrY5T--HpQg-fpYhbbg,"Brooklyn, NY",4/10/2010,3,Great service and atmosphere. We ate like tapas style b/w 3 ppl. Delicious food but over priced. Partially b.c I don't like to spend loads of $$ on food but i wasn't paying so that's why i was there.

G G.,/user_details?userid=ZIRXTCUgLOA_uX9wbc_4Pg,"Baltimore, MD",2/22/2012,3,"Great atmosphere. Bar area gets crowded. Recommend sitting downstairs if you eat here. Now been there twice and really not worth the cost. The first time waited 1.5 hours with reservation. It was a weekend but ridiculous to wait that long with a reservation. The second time... Service was mediocre. Lamb came out rare when ordered medium. Took 25 minutes to cook after pointing out. By then we were finished with our meal. Server forgot drinks. Everybody makes mistakes, but the manager did come by and asked how the meal was. When we responded he could care less. This is not 100$ per person service. And it was a Monday night. So the restaurant was not slammed like a Saturday. So skip the meal, people gaze, order apps at the community table in the bar."

I was with a group of friends doing apps and drinks before going out at The Standard and so we ordered apps, sides, and noodles to share, along with cocktails and then dessert + coffee.  While we got a bit too much attitude for not ordering any mains, I really enjoyed my meal and the service!  The food, though, came out very fast, so if you aren't getting a main dish here - don't plan on lingering.  I can't wait to go back for another special occasion with my ladyfriends."

Boyfriend and I can't wait to go back- we have reservations again this Sunday and it will definitely be on our regular rotation!"

Senem Z.,/user_details?userid=0nQuU3_WEuMpOJzevofnBw,"Philadelphia, PA",6/24/2013,4,"Try black cod, rock shrimp and edamame dumplings. They are all amazing."
Herbert Y.,/user_details?userid=SPAx5OtfVKc1sI06Z5XhZQ,"San Diego, CA",6/29/2009,3,"Meh.  Great atmosphere and excellent service, but food was only OK.  Food not much better than a take out place here in Southern California, which is sad for an upscale restaurant.  Peking duck skin soggy, fish overcooked, peanut noodles just plain weird (think Udon with watered down Jif).  On the upside, prices surprisingly reasonable ($350 for 6 people)."
Duane S.,/user_details?userid=c2CqQSv0cx8Erft_rIsIYQ,"Manhattan, NY",1/7/2011,5,"Great spot to take out-of-town friends for a Manhattan/trendy dining experience without giving up on food quality.  My recommendation for a cost-effective group meal is to go family-style and focus ordering on the dim sum section to share, and then order a couple of entrees at the end.  My favorite dim sums are the edamame dumplings, general tso chicken dumplings, steamed seabass wrapped with bok choy, the pork belly buns, and the taro lollipops.  Favorite entree is the charred fillet-- it has a delicious and buttery garlic sauce.  Also worth getting the wild mushroom chow fun and the crab fried rice for the table."
Barry U.,/user_details?userid=XqtJwZLjZc8NY0zeMw4-Xg,"Staten Island, NY",3/4/2011,3,"4 stars if you just go with the appetizers.  nice tuna tartar and scallion pancakes among other desserts I forget about since we were a party of 12.   The entrees were served cold for half of us.  Especially anyone ordering meat.  I mean you would think a place like this would know how to entertain large groups, right?  I think I enjoyed the AC location better and their mushroom dumplings which was missing here."
Jennifer M.,/user_details?userid=Ja0Ik_6pZCr1FekexL3E8w,"Manhattan, NY",4/11/2011,5,"My daughter and I had dinner last week and it was truly a wonderful experience. She was visiting from Seattle, and I wanted to take her somewhere that was new to us both.    This is a beautiful venue and the food was exceptional!  Our server Ben was delightful and extremely attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and cocktails.  If you like frog's legs it was the best we've ever had and we've travelled throughout Europe.  The SakiTini was refreshing. As for dessert, well suffice to say it too was outstanding.  It wasn't so loud that we couldn't talk.   I can't wait to take my husband, it's very romantic.  We love New York restaurants but Buddakan is now our ""new spot""."
Michelle C.,/user_details?userid=2HV3CPTGacrQbbJWtBD4FQ,"Roseville, CA",7/28/2011,5,"Ah-freakin-mazing! Food and service are top notch here. We ordered edmame dumplings, pork dumplings, pork spare ribs (to die for), beef short rib (die even more) fried rice, and twice cooked long bean. Holy cow best meal I've even eaten. Beautiful atmosphere. The service was excellent. Explained the menu perfectly. Would recommend and plan on returning soon!"
LongBeachReviewer C.,/user_details?userid=XYX_M7TA_zDcSN063nS57w,"Brooklyn, NY",8/10/2011,4,"GO HERE!! It is very good, though pricey, but yummy! The ambiance is gorgeous and the food is out of this world. I went to this one and the one in Atlantic City, and though both very good, I was surprised to find out that they are very different. Different look, different feel, different food. It is definitely worth the money once every now & again."
Rob B.,/user_details?userid=Woy6yI3lRaOkHqpuRKaI4A,"Long Island City, NY",10/2/2011,5,"Wow. Great food, service and ambiance. Mongolian lamb chops are a delightful blend of sweet and savory, deviled tuna tartar is a great concept. Wash it down with the peanut butter bar -- an unbelievably rich hunk of I-don't-know-what that dissolves gracefully on your tongue."
murium k.,/user_details?userid=AmTt6eNf61-roc_-dqOMsg,"Boonton, NJ",10/21/2011,5,"This place is amazing. One of the best Asian Restaurants in the city! Ambiance is on point. Sex and the City the movie was tapped here, so if your a fan you'll enjoy it even more. The Edamame dumplings are unbelievable!"
Gina D.,/user_details?userid=FQRVepk8blN6yQc6OpT33Q,"Whitestone, NY",11/22/2011,5,"I LOVE Buddakan! My favorite place for Asian food in the city.  First of all everything I have ever had there is delicious so u will not hear one complaint. I always get the edamame dumplings but a friend tried one once and was not a big fan.  My other favorites are the pork buns, general tso dumplings and the short rib entree.  I really want to try others but I can't bring myself to ever order anything else because the tender short ribs with the mushroom chow fun is too amazing."

Mario R.,/user_details?userid=Dnbwg5moAOg2OYipOvZvLA,"Waikoloa, HI",4/10/2012,3,So I was sent here from a friend that recommended it and it was a pretty good experience. I had the lobster fried rice and a calamari appetizer. Both were cooked perfectly I think and for it being busy my food came out in time. The only thing I wasn't to pleased is that my waiter looked mad that I didn't order more when he asked me if that's all I'm ordering. Other than that the place is good.
Kareem E.,/user_details?userid=2R1-uHoqNP73OaKNuZjDmA,"New York, NY",6/3/2012,2,"Aside from the desserts skip this trendy mess of an experience. Fried rice was appalling; oily, bland, and just lacking in every way. Short rib was barely recognizable and slathered on a mushy flavorless scallion pancake. Service was friendly but terrible staffing and management resulted in long waits and agitated guests. The only highlights were the stunning desserts, in particular the crying chocolate and tofu cheesecake, which are the only reasons I'd ever consider revisiting."

Michele R.,/user_details?userid=7u7fzM0_1tLPYWkIVMqLoA,"Staten Island, NY",12/21/2012,3,"Three stars and only because I am in a generous Holiday cheer mood, mind you. Maybe it's me, but bring a lighted XMAS tree ornament to light the way here if you want to get some identification of what perhaps you might be injesting and I don't say this in jest. And why? Because if you had a blindfold you would not readily identify, most certainly from the most discerning palatte exactly what it is you are eating. Everthing kind of tasted the same because nothing stood out. Well, actually the size of the scallops did, they were huge but honestly so bland and chewy. And that price tag, gee whiz if you are gonna charge an arm and leg then make it something really memorable. Since it was my Birthday, and yep whose counting? Certainly not moi, we wanted to go to some special place. Well, if only the food were as good as the company. But alas, not so. And you really need to wave something, maybe a white flag to surrender to find the waiter since they all seem to be bustling by at  fever pitch speed. The Rock Shrimp Tempura was okay, had better at Sapporo Sushi on the Landfill, okay, no offense to the ""natives"" but that's Staten Island, and I must say, they do great sushi in the borough. Just get a clothespin to hold your nose. No, I am kidding, last time I checked they closed the dump or did they? I digress, back to the food which I almost forgot what  we ordered, mea culpa for the late in the day review. Go if you must, but keep your expectations low. We did not drink, hey maybe that was the problem."
Dennis M.,/user_details?userid=vS4VbrSqc48SULj86XGvfA,"Morrisville, PA",1/2/2013,4,"I have been at the Buddakan in Philadelphia but always wanted to check out the one in New York City. The outside is SO deceiving. You will miss the restaurant unless someone has previously explained the entrance/building to you. Once you go past the bar, you will see the real Buddakan of NYC!!! Amazing ambiance coupled with succulent dishes separates this restaurant from all other Chinese restaurants. We had some noodles dishes, crab dish, and the spicy fish, and they were all delicious. The dumplings are good too, try the carrot dumplings just for the way they are presented. Happy eating!!!"
Rachel L.,/user_details?userid=wqJVRdWmujG9D8Fl20Pvwg,"Manhattan, NY",2/23/2013,5,"I came here with my parents and boyfriend for my birthday this past October and had a great experience. My boyfriend and I were running a bit late and the staff were very accommodating and we only waited a couple of minutes to be seated (this was a sunday night). Sitting downstairs is a must - the decor is impressive. I had the deviled tuna tartare to start and it was excellent. We also shared the chili rock shrimp and General Tso's dumplings which were very good as well. For our main dishes we shared the sizzling short rib which was excellent, as well as the shrimp and lobster chow fun, the chilled udon noodles, and the chinese sausage fried rice. I especially loved the chinese sausage fried rice, the fried egg is a nice touch. All of the food was delicious and our waiter was very friendly and helpful. I also had the 'Fate' cocktail which I would recommend to all those who enjoy sweet, girly drinks as much as I do. A bit pricey but fun for a special occasion,  I would return without a doubt."
Lina S.,/user_details?userid=pl9gMu4GZK1O8Po_0Qz3VA,"West Orange, NJ",3/2/2013,2,"Okay - I understand why people like this place.  It's got really amazing decor and tasty, unusual cocktails.  However, it's really expensive, and I found that the food wasn't really anything to write home about.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you can get something tastier in Chinatown for a quarter of the price.  On the other hand, that wouldn't be as trendy.  That's really the selling point of this establishment - that they're hip and exclusive, and that's why they book you for a 10pm reservation and then make you wait another two hours to be seated.  There are so many places to eat in New York City - if you repeatedly get told that it'll ""just be a few minutes,"" you may want to hightail it elsewhere."
Amanda R.,/user_details?userid=lptcU5f6KjgfO0LkKBK-rQ,"Manhattan, NY",3/10/2013,5,So good everytime. Steamed pork buns must. Boyfriend gets the pepper beef everytime. Filet mignon so tender. Perfect for couples or groups. Appetizers or full meals. So good!
Sienna L.,/user_details?userid=C84f0KYkSp0sJHD29OntmQ,"New York, NY",4/7/2013,5,"If you're looking for a place to go for your birthday, this is it. Large space and beautiful decor. After dinner, there are numerous places to go to from dive bars to clubs. Food wise I fell in love with the Buddakan in Atlantic City for their sea bass.  A year later, and it is still the best sea bass i've ever had. The Buddakan in the city has a similar menu. I got some sort of steak.. it was cut up into small pieces and stacked.  Not sure what it was called but it was damn good. Overall, a good place to go have a good time with a group."

Artemis F.,/user_details?userid=xR1NRC6yc9vHS2Zv2IOd5A,"New York, NY",12/28/2008,4,This place is huge!  and absolutely beautiful!  A really nice place for drinks and to bring out-of-towners if you want to impress!  Its very trendy and hip-  the food is all right (I prefer Asia de Cuba's food) but definately worth a visit or two!
Jaime I.,/user_details?userid=_Z-9CN-yElFUmaL2889y0A,"Jersey City, NJ",2/2/2009,5,One of the best in the city!  The chinese sausage fried rice is the best!  The short ribs and steaks are great too.  The tuna is amazing!  GO TO THIS RESTAURANT NOW PLEASE!!!
M K.,/user_details?userid=OEeDnK12szrQfGPN99-JRw,"Berkeley, CA",3/15/2009,3,The best thing about the place was the ambiance - very chic. It made an appearance in the sex and the city movie - where Carrie had her wedding rehearsal dinner. The food was enjoyable but not earth-shattering. The cocktails and drinks were good.
Servane D.,/user_details?userid=bPTUSjjOX1iWdwmCRW8LFg,"Fremont, CA",6/2/2009,5,Food was exquisite! Try the lollipop as a starter

This restaurant was a great place for a large group, but be aware that parties of 15 or more are given options for set menus that start from $75 per person, not including drinks, tax, or tip."

Mrs P.,/user_details?userid=MTqpxIWjQS1AiLca-KqO9w,"Manhattan, NY",11/9/2011,1,"Sorry, but what a ridiculous place. It's way too dark in the bar. There was way too much staff prancing about not doing anything. Took 20 minutes before a menu came. My man ordered a beer, I ordered a pinot, he got his after 10 minutes and the waitress forgot about mine. When we ordered the food she commented on each choice as if I was a five year old and mummy needs to tell me what's good for me. Nothing was spicy. My steamed fish was far too bitter. And everything we ordered (and there were many dishes for the 4 of us) was COLD. Table wasn't cleared for at least 20 minutes afterward while loads and loads of black clad staff walked past all the time, looking very busy, but never actually carrying anything. What a silly trendy wank place. Never again."

Don't know if I would go that far but it was delicious. Very unique menu as well. Must try the edamame dumplings. Also loved the black Alaskan cod.  Taking one star off because of the loudness of the music- as pet peeve.

Derek O.,/user_details?userid=HE1my4YVotFaPJCl8vHdLQ,"TX, TX",4/28/2012,5,Just amazing Chinese food in an ultra chic NYC setting. My husband and I didn't make a booking but found a seat in the lounge. It looked kind of chaotic but the server we had was completely on it. I never felt we had to wait too long and everything came out in a timely fashion. Highly recommend the green pea and shrimp dumpling...to die for and the Cantonese steamed fish was just like my mother's. Yes we are Cantonese and it is mind blowing to have authentic Chinese food presented in a Western setting but the flavours were pretty traditional with just a light twist of something new.
Jeana M.,/user_details?userid=knU8V3cgeLtoxiMiqya6Xg,"Hopewell Junction, NY",6/26/2012,5,"LOVED this restaurant. the service was great, the atmosphere was amazing and the food was so good.

This beautiful  restaurant has two levels, with many rooms. I had the Charm cocktail which was excellent. For the appetizers we ordered the Cantonese Spring Roll and the Tuna Spring Roll. Both items were outstanding. For the entrees we ordered the Charred Fillet of Beef (which was cooked to order) and the Hot and Sour Scallops. Both were excellent. For a side dish we ordered the Wok Noodles with Prawns. This was also outstanding. The desserts we ordered were excellent. We had the Almond Bread Pudding and the Chocolate Malted Tart. Both desserts included outstanding ice cream. The Coffee was also great. The service throughout the meal was incredible!"

The food is to die for and the drinks for NYC are pretty well priced around 12 dollars and the steak has been one of the best steaks I have ever had. There is nothing bad about this place that I can think of good food and good drinks what more can you ask for! Plus it's we're they filmed sex and the city.

The ambiance was nice with half-naked hostesses welcoming you into the restaurant. I had a cocktail which I found really nice. For entree, I ordered a whole fish because I wanted to have healthy food for dinner but contrary to my expectation, the fish was deep-fried and bended like a huge bangle. If you like spacious, I mean spacious, dining experience, this place is good but I would spend my money somewhere else for great food. It is shame because I loved the cocktail."

Kathy G.,/user_details?userid=_gVDKDLgyKgl_vP5O4hZcA,"New York, NY",7/2/2008,3,"So I had a mixed experience at Buddakan.  Food was good; service stunk.  I was seated in the back of the downstairs area of the restaurant so I was ushered through the entire restaurant on my way to my table.  Like other reviewers have noted, its absolutely gorgeous.  Once seated, it took a full 20 minutes for a server to come and speak to my table.  We actually had to ask a porter for water and our waiter.  Once the waiter arrived we ordered coctails, four appetizers and an entree to share between the two of us.  While the waiter comp'ed the drinks due to the lack of initial attention, he forgot one of our appetizers.  The food was very good, our favorite dishes being the crispy duck spring rolls and mongolian lamb chops.  By the time we realized that our missing appetizer wasn't coming we were already pretty stuffed so that ended up being a blessing in disguise.  We felt the idea of sharing appetizers worked really well and was WAY cheaper than if we had each ordered an entree."
Eunhee K.,/user_details?userid=PUmhSnAzX-hTJjBqY2_s4w,"Brooklyn, NY",5/14/2013,2,"this place is filled with B&T crowd, which is fine if the food was worth it and all but it's not. it's not bad, but it's not ""wow, great"" either. portions are tiny (ordered like 6 apps and 3 entrees for only 2 ppl) but still was hungry. this place is more for ambience and the b&t party scene (young and old) a lot of big hair with hairspray and too much perfume and cologne types."
Eric K.,/user_details?userid=xqaXxRLrHnBJz9gL5NzesQ,"New York, NY",7/31/2008,3,"Whenever I go to restaurants like Buddakan I can't help but think of this one episode of the Simpson's.  Patty and Selma are sitting on their couch watching Sex and the City.   They blow rings of smoke at the TV and say with a raspy voice, ""This show is like looking the mirror!""  This place is what it is, a scene.  I have no problem with that, the décor is great (although a bit cavernous) and I'm sure a fun place for just drinks.  I went with a group last night for dinner; the food was ok, nothing spectacular, completely average over hyped NY cuisine.  What you pay for is the scene, which is completely fine if that's what you're looking to do.  However like all trendy NY establishments of this nature I do predict an increasing swarm of B&T groups looking for a Sex and the City night out on the town.  Beware of waiters tripping on someone's pump fat sticking out of their Manolo's and egg rolls flying everywhere..."
Anjali J.,/user_details?userid=104uD3sjNOCzy-X2JtGwOw,"Chicago, IL",9/21/2009,1,"I went to Buddakan this past weekend with a large group of friends.  I was very disappointed with the service, ambiance and food.  I cannot even recall a single redeeming quality of this place. The ambiance was not inviting at all. Our group of 8 was seated in the middle of a long table where we were sharing with other groups of people. I thought the set up was strange since you could hear the other group's conversations. Next the service matched the ambiance, it was terrible. As soon as we sat down and received our menus our waitress came by to take our order. We had not even sat down for 2 minutes or had a chance to glance at the menu. I felt like we were being rushed so they could clear the table as soon as possible.  For the money you spend on this place the least they can do is give you time to look at the menu. The menu looked interesting but the flavors were sub par.  Everything we ordered was bland besides the edamame dumplings. The waitress stressed that the entrees were served family style but for the portions you would need to order three times the amount of food to feed your party. While we were eating the bus boys were trying to take our plates away. I found that extremely rude. Overall I would NEVER go back to this restaurant nor recommend it to anyone else."

Tyler N.,/user_details?userid=tA_SY9Ran9dS3DsgZ1DEGQ,"Toluca Terrace, CA",1/19/2011,4,"had great experiences here for 2 nights. it was a bit interesting that they sent u to this lounge area to wait for the hostess to come get u after u checked in. it took the hostess 5 mins or so to take us to the table. it was not a big deal but can be annoying. both nights i had a great time, food and service. the waiter really knows their stuff and recommended great dishes. both nights i had different appetizers, main course and dessert. for appetizer, the must try when u visit buddakan are lobster egg rolls, general tso's dumplings, and steamed sea bass roll. i've also tried scallion pancakes but it wasnt as good comparing to others. for main course, i had charred filet of beef, charred asparagus, wild mushroom chow fun, lobster fried rice and glazed alaskan black cod, which is a must try. for dessert i had honey jasmine cheesecake, which was very good. both nights i was there, they were busy but my reservations were at 7:30. i had a great experience at buddakan all around, the atmosphere, food and service. a great place for any occasions whether it's birthday, celebration, dinner meeting, romantic dinner. a really great place for out of towners to try. i'd definitely return on my next trip to nyc!!"

FoodLover Z.,/user_details?userid=gWN6MS2EmAO-SOvTbnHpUw,"Chicago, IL",5/16/2013,3,"great ambiance and food, average drinks. we had the dim sums, fried rice and a couple of vegetable and chicken entrees. the dim sums and fried rice were great; i'd go back just for those. the entrees were good, but not spectacular. they could definitely do a better job on their drinks though. all of the drinks felt a little watered down and were way too sweet. all in all, a good experience, but nothing spectacular by NYC-standards."
Gary B.,/user_details?userid=5IPVH8EOsweEt8WE_WhO_A,"NY, NY",10/30/2008,5,"I enjoyed my dinner here. Obviously a shi-sh-fru-fru experience, but in an era where decadence is no longer seen out and about it was refreshing to dine here and observe a generally well dressed and attractive crowd. The setting is amazing, I love the idea of walking down the steps to your table, treat it as your own personal runway folks! The space is massive and the restaurant check-in area is set up hotel style, so you aren't crowded at the door attempting to let the hosts know that you have arrived! The seating area/bar while you wait is cute, and at first I onwdered how they would locate me amidst such a loud and packed room but they came and seated my party promptly. My waitress was very friendly without beings syrupy or programmed  (you know the kind of service you get at chains). She recommened we do maybe 3 appetizers and 2 entrees, all of which were good, especially the rock shrimp. My water was refilled promptly, my white Russian was good! Are the portions small? Yes, but why do people complain about this? Go to Cheeesecake Factory or Maggianos if you want to gorge and pig out. After the apps and the entree, I didn't even have room for dessert. All in all, this spot seems to be one of the trendy restaurants with substance!"
Kamila D.,/user_details?userid=sXJ2JNXf8elGXyFSnss22A,"North Bergen, NJ",12/9/2009,1,"I was recently entertaining family in town from Germany who were staying in the MPD and chose Buddakan because of the hype.  Nice ambiance but very disappointing.  I ordered a HOT & SOUR SCALLOPS sweet corn, tofu and black mushrooms $25.00.  The dish was acceptable, too much soy sauce and 1 RUSTY THUMB TACK that I almost swallowed as I thought I was chewing on a bone!  I immediately notified waiter and eventually the Floor Manager and followed up by the General Mgr.  They basically insinuated that I planted the thumb tack since they don't have office supplies.  At that point I was outraged.  I wanted to take the thumb tack to my physician but they said the kitchen couldn't find it.  How convenient!  The General Manager said it probably came from China where they get the mushrooms.  Even if that were so, the Kitchen would still have to wash the mushrooms and cut them to make the dish.  Wouldn't someone have noticed the RUSTY TACK!  To cut a long story short, our meal was abruptly ended.  On Monday morning, I saw my physician who gave me a tetanus shot as a precaution."

M D.,/user_details?userid=Lm8p6OQtcAjQ-nn8pqDYcg,"Holmdel Township, NJ",3/12/2013,4,"Visited here this past weekend and LOVED IT!! The ambiance is amazing... as soon as you walk in you've stepped into a different world! Very clean, stylish and the decor is great. I had to wait for my party so I went to sit at the bar and had a few cocktails - fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!! Loved the drinks! The restaurant itself is huge!! So many little nooks - there were tables for large parties, and tables for just couples, great! The food was just out of this world - the portion sizes were good for the price, and really filling and very different!!  I really enjoyed the Duck as it was my first time trying it and the pork fried rice were delicious. Desert was even better.. I had some type of coconut cake which was scrumptious! The only thing I didn't like about this place was that it was so dark!! The bathrooms were pitch black and I hated that - I almost stumbled a few times whilst walking around - I wish they'd turn on a few more lights! Other than that - great place, can't wait to visit again!"
Rana K.,/user_details?userid=bj2Hf39Apk8NPybejyNEPw,"Chicago, IL",3/25/2013,5,"A favorite go-to when in NYC, the food here is always delicious and the ambiance fabulous. Was at a business dinner with 8 people recently and we ordered the sharing menu (probably ordered the most vast option because about 15 different foods showed up. WOW!) Unfortunatley, I was recovering from stomach flu and really unable to eat anything, but I asked my waiter for a recommendation on the best optoin given my tummy-issues -- he suggested the carrot pot stickers and the vegetable stir fried rice. Honestly, these were just perfect and so delicious/light. And while deeply saddened to not be able to eat anything else on the table, the waiter made my night by suggesting two options that were just perfect for my needs. He couldn't have been more accomodating and helpful. Great service, Great menu. Great fun. Looking forward to another trip here soon to actually be able to eat the delicious foods on the menu!"
Sunil R.,/user_details?userid=WZ3yxXHpxcLVY1CJGzUGlg,"Bellerose, NY",3/21/2009,3,"Buddakan is an ultra-trendy restaurant which is famed for delivering on all fronts of the dining experience. the decor is very well done, this place has the perfect ambiance for a special occasion dinner (at least for college students, such as me and my girlfriend). the service is good, servers know what they are talking about. now, to the food, which, although i expected to be very good in terms of execution and technique is also surprisingly authentic. the crispy duck spring rolls were light and were enhanced tenfold by the pomegranate dip. in terms of entrees, the steamed red snapper was the best thing i had all night. perfectly cooked, and perfectly accented by the black mushrooms. we also had the sizzling short rib, which although cooked perfectly, literally falling apart as we cut it, was a little bland. the desert was part great part boring, the bruleed bananas with spiced chocolate ice cream were both very good, but the chocolate ganache that was served in unison was too sweet and overpowering. overall, the food was good, a little different and more authentic than i expected, but overall a great dining experience."

This place is a jewel and perfect for a romantic date!"

Mike M.,/user_details?userid=u2h0ENk0KQwB8b-UwvlHDQ,"Gaithersburg, MD",2/28/2023,2,"My first trip to NYC and this was the only pasta place we went to. We get seated basically right away, that's where the good about this place ended. We order our food and wait, and wait, and wait... Server comes out about 20 mins in and says it'll be just a few more minutes. 20 more mins go by and he comes out and apologizes for the wait and that there was a mess up in the kitchen.  Saw 3 tables come in and they all finished eating before we finally got our food.  So I'm hoping the food is worth the wait. Nope, couldn't be that lucky. I ordered chicken marsala that was drowning in a sauce that tasted absolutely nothing like marsala. Girlfriend orders the Bolognese, which I thought wasn't good but not the worst thing ever, but she hated it and didn't eat it. Daughter gets the fettuccine Alfredo, the sauce just tasted like a watery heavy cream with a sprinkle of Parm. But she liked it so that's all that matters. Mind you, I'm from the west coast and have been hearing for years how east coast Italian food is so much better than the west coast. Granted this was my only NYC pasta experience so I only have this place to judge it on but I've only been to one Italian place on the west coast that didn't have better Italian food than this place. Biggest food disappointment of my trip. I Will have to go back to NYC and try a different spot. Only not giving it 1 star bc my daughter liked her dish."

Wonderfull staffs all very courteous and made sure we are served. At anytime we were able to raise our hand and find the friendly staffs around us. The foods is magnificent. Pasta dishes are delicious. Love the hospitality we will definitely be back. Lobster ravioli and clams linguini are very flavourful. Lobster ravioli are heavenly with the creamy sauce. The staffs offer us more bread to dip with my creamy luscious sauce.
Alisa G.,/user_details?userid=hAX8SfSYYbWDm5vcnQjYsw,"Seattle, WA",6/6/2022,4,Family dinner on our first night in NYC & Da Gennaro did not disappoint! I had the seafood risotto & MAN! I love the taste & how they did NOT skimp on the seafood. My mom's lasagna came with a side of spaghetti (that we didn't know about). I love me a good steamed mussel appetizer with white wine & this definitely is one of my favorites for sure. One thing I will say is that the place can get quite cramped on a busy night. The space between our table and the family next to us is so close that you can only walk sideways through it.

Dee D.,/user_details?userid=jZTAZH81kqvVNk0asbucIA,"New York, NY",9/21/2022,3,"The food was ok . For appetizer we had mussels in a garlic wine sauce that was good . I ordered eggplant parmigiana that came with spaghetti the sauce is not very good . My daughter had spaghetti and meatballs and she couldn't even eat the meatballs said they tasted like they came out if a can , like it was chef boyardee. Oh and the bread they give you is cold and some of it very hard . A $80 meal not worth it at all . I do not recommend."
PJ F.,/user_details?userid=BECa1cML2FEZ59m188bN6g,"Richfield, MN",12/8/2021,5,"Back again. It's been a year! God I missed this. Greeted with familiarity as usual! I went with friends and had the traditional spaghetti. Fresh, saucy, tomatoey and herby. My favorite NY place on Earth. Outstanding service, delicious food. It's a damn warm comforting Italian blanket wrapped around me."
Steve A.,/user_details?userid=6P82zsAVLVvcCiAJDnFaCg,"Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, FL",12/11/2022,4,While visiting NYC we stopped in mostly for the Yelp reviews as there are so many restaurants on Mulberry street. Although rather pricey both the food and service were very good. Considering the restaurant was packed we didn't feel rushed for the table. We would come again when visiting the area.
Monica T.,/user_details?userid=4ijb930oFsm8YftCABrgeA,"Lewisville, TX",12/29/2022,1,"Came here on Thursday, December 29th at 5:50 pm. After we placed our order, we waited 40 minutes before I flagged and reminded the server what we had. The salad and appetizer came out immediately then the entree came out barely thrown together. Incredibly disappointing for a $25 entree."
Katrina L.,/user_details?userid=5WadA0g863dKc9NxXXc9yw,"Jacksonville, FL",12/29/2022,4,Great service. Open late. Food was good - had risotto that was delicious.  Servers were attentive.
Ashley C.,/user_details?userid=kGZFPmshoteBZUTE3K6j7Q,"New York, NY",12/18/2021,4,Had a great time here with my girlfriends! My friends pasta Alfredo was incredibly delicious! Cocktails were nice and generous. Waiter was a little inattentive so one star off for that. Their outdoor seating has great heat lamps as well! Would definitely come back!
Kayla S.,/user_details?userid=BwKSePkn23tc27_ujjhy-Q,"Central Business District, New Orleans, LA",2/10/2023,1,Attempted to dine after reading multiple reviews raving about the service and food at this restaurant. I ventured here with my mom after a long day at the airport and long travels. Upon arrival at 11 pm I was told that this establishment was closed by the staff that was eating in the lobby. I explained that online it was listed as still open and they had no response and continued eating. I was disappointment by the management and staff.
Araya M.,/user_details?userid=kF8JRkSYKUp6CbvVMnbcfw,"New York, NY",11/15/2021,4,The food was good like traditional Italian grandma made for you at home . It's like Standard  good .Nice portion. Service was nice . It's good for tourists i guest as I live in New York there would be so many choices for me .
John A.,/user_details?userid=5BiF_engTipfwkDpevt6rw,"Bergen County, NJ",11/3/2021,5,"I was walking around the city and passed this restaurant when I came down Mulberry Street, on my way to Chinatown. I was exploring and taking photographs and when it was time to get something to eat -- I went back to DA Gennaro! It was a nice afternoon so I sat outside. There were a few other tables with people and they filled up even more after I arrived. I ordered one of the $25 lunch specials. I ordered the Chicken Francese which came with a salad, bread and dessert. I chose Tiramisu for dessert. All of the food was delicious and nice portions, too. For a drink I had a diet coke. One thing to note -- there are no free refills, so every time I got a refill - it was another $4 added to my bill. Oh well, lesson learned. I had several servers -- that's the way they do it here, and they were all nice and attentive."

Leslie D.,/user_details?userid=5Gczt67lp2ct00vKGmptrg,"Brooklyn, NY",10/19/2021,5,"We stopped here for dinner while visiting the San Gennaro festival and it was soooo packed. The wait was about 30 min but we grabbed a drink at the bar next door while waiting and it flew by. Was hoping to get oysters but they weren't serving them because it was way too busy which was understandable. Our food was good and so were the drinks. Waiter was attentive and nice, I would be back to try the oysters!"

Jessica M.,/user_details?userid=vFFzVH2tc3Y8iX-PM0xE1w,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/20/2021,3,"We stopped by this weekend during the Festo of San Gennaro.  It's a nice restaurant with plenty of outdoor dining to enjoy the nice weather. The downside to our experience here was that they seemed understaffed to handle the rush of people dining out. Service was incredibly slow and as a result our appetizer and entree arrived late and at the same time. They had served bread right before, but it was cold. The lasagna I ordered was a small portion size, but tasted ok. We each ordered the aeperol spirtz, but they were also a miss. They seemed watered down. Overall, it wasn't our best dining experience, but it may have been bad luck due to the many people at the festival."

Renatta P.,/user_details?userid=L6EXQtRRuGBRNqhZ_qrSDA,"Little Neck, NY",9/17/2022,1,"Biggest Disappointment  ever. Worst Italian restaurant i have ever been to. Carbonara and angel hair primavera was  soooo bland. We tried to put salt, pepper and cheese. And it still taste like cardboard. We told these two older women and all she did was shake her head and sent a tiramisu. They have no sense of costumer service. They should have taken at least  one of the dishes off the bill."
Neo S.,/user_details?userid=ksmLhBqV9MEtvGf8jFtcOA,"New York, NY",3/10/2023,2,"Service is good, but very mechanical - they will ask you if everything is OK after 2 seconds of bringing the food to the table. And they brought out our entrees while we were still working on our multiple appetizers. We had to organize the table on our own so that all plates will stay on the table while entrees were getting cold. I made a comment about it, but they didn't do anything about it. Ambiance is not bad and could trap unsuspecting tourists. We were too lazy to go to another area, but if you want good Italian food in NYC that's worth the price, you must go somewhere else but the little Italy unfortunately. As others said, the bread was stale and dry. Olive oil was decent. Octopus was small and SO dry. You can get a much better octopus at any Italian restaurant in the village or midtown for the same or less price. Lasagna was very small for the price and again, you can do better elsewhere. It was too much cheese and sauce and little pasta and meat. But the taste of the sauce and cheeses was good. Muscles were good except for one dead shell which is not good. Small portion for the price. You can get a bucket of muscles for the same price in the village French or Belgian restaurants. Mushroom risotto was good and tasty."
K S.,/user_details?userid=U2R_Jo1qjVgoowSxFzEy8Q,"Canfield, OH",12/30/2022,5,"This restaurant has been our Little Italy go-to for years, and it is a must on every trip to NYC. The atmosphere is very nice, especially if you're lucky enough to get window seating during the San Gennaro Festival. The sauce is very good; we have never been disappointed with any dish we tried. The last time we went (12/27/22), tables were crammed in more than usual, you were very much on top of strangers next to you. It made dining rather uncomfortable, especially when you had to keep getting up to let people in or out next to you. There are many places like that in NYC, but Da Gennaro always had a more quaint, upscale feel. I'm hoping this was just to accommodate the holiday crowds, instead of a long-term change in seating.  I look forward to trying again on my next trip."

A bit on the slow side if you're in a hurry so be forewarned but hey, if you have a perfect evening and great weather, not a better spot to enjoy excellent Italian food. Definitely will be back and highly recommend. Everything was great."

Gergis was a phenomenal server and the tiramisu at the end of our meal was the best part. Would 100% come again and enjoy the delicious food and vibes!"
Sumanth K.,/user_details?userid=ZzLVMvjcJR8AcTCQ8mu7tg,"New York, NY",12/22/2021,4,We were craving Italian food and made our way down to Little Italy to visit this spot. The atmosphere and service was great with lovely Christmas music. I ordered the rigatoni and my only complaint would be the fact that it had peas in it as it ruined the consistency for me. But I do think there are options to not include the peas so I would recommend that. Overall a great place and I would recommend to check it out!
Eve N.,/user_details?userid=ySB_Ss2kqqzaNXsRhrsSfQ,"New York, NY",12/3/2022,3,"We were looking for a restaurant in Little Italy and randomly stumbled on this place.  Although it was busy, we were seated right away inside.  The noise level made it a bit hard to talk but made the restaurant seem very lively.  Service was very attentive and we were checked on several ties.  We ordered the arancini, chicken marsala, and spaghetti with meat sauce.  The arancini was on the small side and had decent taste.  The spaghetti also tasted good.  The sauce on the chicken marsala was orange and tasted like a tomato sauce.  I've usually had this with a sauce that was more brown with less tomato taste.  It could be perhaps that is how it is made here but I do prefer the brown sauce style more.  We did get a bit of sticker shock when the bill came so the prices here are on the high side."
Karla V.,/user_details?userid=QU0y7NpCuICs9MF4Q3lP0w,"Arcadia, CA",7/30/2022,2,Came here because it was near my hotel and we were there for 20 minutes before anyone even took our order. We then waited almost an hour for them to bring out the food!! I got the penne la vodka and it was good but NOT worth the hour long wait.

Denise D.,/user_details?userid=4CVgd1w36am0Ez80dPv7ew,"Punta Gorda, FL",10/5/2021,5,"After walking what seemed like a thousand miles in NYC, this restaurant called our name with its wonderful smells. There was also a street performer playin my favorite Italian song, La Vie En Rose so I knew it was meant to be. Wine was cold and delicious and one of the best Caesar salads I have ever experienced. The lettuce was crispy and cold with a perfect amount of tasty dressing. The standout was the croutons. You can have the best salad in the world, but throw a bagged crouton on it and I'm probably not going to eat it. We had a big dinner planned so we split one, but I regret that decision to this day. Ask for extra croutons! I so wish I had. Miguel was a fabulous server and suggested the inferno pizza. Love me some spice and it delivered! Now this isn't what I would call an attractive pizza, but it was the perfect thickness with just the right amount of crunch. We had lots of pizza but this was the star. So much so that I probably won't even review the others. They were fine but not like this one!"

Karlos A.,/user_details?userid=08JrQMrwVsREDxGMPkI0UQ,"Charlotte, NC",11/21/2021,2,"I had come here before, about four years ago and this place was delicious. I'm not sure what happened or I don't know if they switched chefs or something but the food was not good at all. I guess it was missing salt or it was missing seasoning or something but it really couldn't taste like anything. I can actually cook way better than that and the price is very very high for the quality of food. I'm very disappointed and I guess I'm gonna have to find another Italian restaurant next time I come to the little early."

Eric D.,/user_details?userid=Mc_TbZNVITlGIJhDdOT8nQ,"Cheektowaga, NY",9/8/2021,3,"Beautiful restaurant, wonderful location and ambiance, good prices, and super yummy food. Lousy service. We stopped in around ten when a lot of places were closing on a Tuesday night they were not busy. We were seated and provided with menus and we waited. Finally water showed up and our order taken and we waited maybe fifteen minutes for our food, not too bad in all brought out by somebody who was not our waiter. So we ate and finished our drinks and waited, and waited, and never saw the waiter again until he showed up randomly about half an hour later to ask if we were done and began grabbing the plates and stuff. No refills no check ups or anything. I asked for separate checks and he says no problem. Comes back with one check and we wait and wait and wait some more. I know it was late and probably a long day. But we are customers who matter too. And I couldn't help notice that for all the ignoring of my friend and I our waiter had plenty of time to flirt up the cute girls at the table across the way all they wanted. Next time take out only I wouldn't waste my time sitting in."
Katie L.,/user_details?userid=UAo3FWTqRHXWH0os8M0jqg,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3/27/2021,3,"This Italian restaurant in a sea of Italian restaurants was recommended to me by my sister. Since she and I usually share the same taste in food, my boyfriend and I decided to give this place a go. We ordered meatballs, bruschetta, and fettuccine Alfredo. The overall impression for us is that the food did not taste as wonderful as it looked, and we were a bit disappointed. We did feel heavy for the rest of the day without the neutralizing effect of reaching an Italian food nirvana so that was a bummer. But the employees were very friendly and we appreciated the experience!"

Ru M.,/user_details?userid=6PUJ3t9DOi0xeoz2_yxRew,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/10/2022,5,"This place has slowly become a family favorite for me and my family. We've been 3 times in the past month and a half and it's been consistently good. Some items we liked better than others. My mom got the salmon, and shrimp with asparagus in vodka sauce which we all really liked. Do yourself a favor and get it. I also ordered the shrimp with spinach and tomatoes, it was supposed to be with garlic and olive oil but I wanted tomatoe sauce as well. I enjoyed mine it was flavorful, and everything cooked perfectly. Also they have pizza, for appetizer, makes sure you get that too, it's very good. My sister got the shrimp and fettuccini Alfredo, it wasn't my favorite but she liked it. Also they have eggplant which I enjoyed as well. Lots of cheese and good sauce. Would order again. And food is reasonably priced, not crazy expensive and not cheap. It's worth it and will definitely be back. Also service is good here."

Cate L.,/user_details?userid=Y_odIZT5ZmCuYzqnT-Q-MQ,"New York, NY",2/14/2022,4,Yum really delicious pappardelle bolognese pasta I love pappardelle hard to find its quiet an unique type of pasta I like broad noodles its soo flavorful but thin so the flavor grabs on. They give you a sizeable portion definitely keeps you full. The waiters are very kind and bring you your ordered drinks and even a full glass of water and another pitcher of water in case. This would be so great in the summertime walking around and being parched. I had my early dinner (around 5pm) outdoors in the winter and they have electric heaters on the table it was very warm and toasty. I felt warm and didn't feel cold at all when I was waiting and even after I got my food while I was eating. I prefer the outdoors because they play music so you can vibe to the songs. They played some 80s music I felt it was a very nice vibe. Indoors is nice too they have a lot of tables open both indoors and outdoors for dinner. I really recommend this place the food is good and portions sizes are generous!
Iveth O.,/user_details?userid=0zkvc7K6NTl8p7U2_k2LBw,"New York, NY",11/13/2022,5,Andres and Douglas were very kind and welcoming. The hospitality here was amazing. The food was incredible.

Ofelia E.,/user_details?userid=pFvJD_u68-FSvXKnluTDqA,"New York, NY",11/15/2020,4,"This a solid Italian restaurant but doesn't completely live up to the hype. We made a reservation for a Friday night. We got there and still had to wait over 30 mins, what was the point of the reservation then? Service was good and so was the food, however we weren't impressed. We got the margherita pizza and chicken parmigiana, both pretty basic dishes that are hard to mess up. They were yummy but nothing exceptional. The bruschetta was good too."

They had some outdoor seating as well but we enjoyed the indoor ambience. We were a party of 9 so we had a little bit of everything from lobster ravioli, pizza & and spaghetti. Everything was delicious ! Once I got back home to Cali I began missing this food. Can't wait to be back in NYC just to visit this restaurant."

However something has changed the waiters and staff are not the same and the menu is very different. We ask about a couple of normal dishes and had the waiter answer in a loud rude manner. We ended up walking out and eating  in another restaurant nearby. The waiter didn't even care. I mentioned our disappointment to the maître d' and he apologized.

The waiters and waitresses were super kind. They also have lunch specials. We got the bruschetta and two ravioli pastas. The bruschetta was honestly kind of pricey - it was i think 10 or 12 dollars, for 3 pieces of bread, tomatos, mozarella, and balsamic. After the appetizer, they brought some bread to the table.. The ravioli was tasty. It only comes with four pieces but combined w the bruschetta and the bread they give you, it was enough. The sauce for the ravioli was very salty, but the flavor was good. It has small pieces of lobster throughout."

Eduardo O.,/user_details?userid=Tf5Zbx-_4jEtveM7bhOmoQ,"Downtown, Nashville, TN",9/15/2021,4,"We were looking for a place to eat. And we like the menu and decided to give it a shot. The hostess was a very friendly polish woman, she said our wait for an outside table would me 30 minutes. But in less than 10 minutes we had a table. We ordered fried calamari for an appetizer. And it was delicious. We ordered lasagna and carbonara pasta that was very good. We ordered shrimp pesto and took so long to come to the table. We had to ask the waiter and the hostess and after a good 30 minutes we got the shrimp pesto pasta. That was delicious. I just don't give 5 stars because of the waiting time for the last dish. But definitely would go back again."
david l.,/user_details?userid=74eE-jgCGO24YKIci38UcQ,"Brooklyn, NY",7/5/2020,4,Phase 2 outdoor dining at Little Italy. Da Gennaro is a good choice. There is a good amount of tables and spaces far apart enough for safety. All the employees were wearing mask and very friendly. The food overall was good. The Caprese salad needed seasoning but everything on the plate was fresh. Pizza was cooked nice but just a bit too thin. Chicken and Eggplant Parm was cooked the way I like with the slightly caramelized cheese. The sauce was perfect. I didn't get to taste but the Linguine Vongole was very flavorful and came with real clams. Give this a place a try !
Marie H.,/user_details?userid=101UCpyZ-soMkT-Lx6jDNA,"Mount Sinai, NY",9/26/2021,5,We loved our time here so much that we went two days in a row. The cocktails and food were amazing. The staff was so attentive and on the ball even during super high traffic dining times. Highly recommend this spot. You won't be disappointed.
Rafa F.,/user_details?userid=ac5VAqmA3oFEPyFWv39F7Q,"Guaynabo, Puerto Rico",1/27/2022,5,Amazing food! Best genuine Italian food I've ever had! Service was on spot both the server and manager were very kind and attentive!

Maksut M.,/user_details?userid=006zXSS9nqu1d0ouE5QgSQ,"New York, NY",1/17/2022,1,It was terrible and waste my time just came for brunch at 9:40am. Restaurant should open by 9am and no setup no plates.  Time is 10:45 Am we just get bread which is cold and two plates with Utensils. Won't go again.
Juliana C.,/user_details?userid=OREp1FjD2xwrGWNHiWzy2g,"Midtown, Savannah, GA",8/9/2021,4,"Loved this place! Food was amazing, only thing is I wish the Bruschetta bread (one of the apps) was different from the basket of bread they put on the table. Bruschetta is supposed to be made with toasted bread. Other than that I got the eggplant parm with spaghetti and it was very filling. My bf got the lobster ravioli and that was also delicious and filling. For dessert we got vanilla and chocolate cream puffs and they were probably one of the best cream puffs I've ever had. Lastly the only thing that shouldn't have been said is the waiter gave us the check then said like 12x ""if you could give me my tip in cash or check that would be great."" Just something that shouldn't be said at a semi-fancy restaurant, the service all around from beginning to end should be good."

Rosbelys G.,/user_details?userid=TBc2AyPkku3MS17xZZE6vA,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",5/15/2021,5,I loved every moment from start from end. The waiting staff was super responsive and always attentive. The food was also very tasty and the drinks!

The staff is Super Friendly and they work together like a Team! I just recently travelled to Italy and I just say, This food is worthy of accolades! I had the linguine with an assortment of seafood!

Kendall L.,/user_details?userid=s0lUz6tGrz_-E_3dtXAknQ,"Detroit, MI",8/23/2022,1,"All black people stay away from this place! The service here was terrible. The waiter did not offer us bread, did not shake the Parmesan cheese for us as he did for other tables, and charged us with items that we did not order. This experience made it pretty clear to me that the waiter was racist and did not want me and my black friends to eat at this restaurant. When we were signing our checks, he hovered over us to see if we were leaving tips because he knew his piss poor service was undeserving of one. Only thing the waiter didn't do was call us mulignans, but I'm pretty sure he was thinking it in his head. 0/10 experience. Again, please stay away!"
Cydney D.,/user_details?userid=HBTfFs1qY8lyXiwnA9bd-A,"Northwest Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, OK",7/17/2022,4,"Perhaps one of the better locations in Little Italy, but price was incredibly high. I had the pasta sampler per a recommendation from a friend and it was over 30 dollars, with no protein. Staff was very friendly and helpful! Outside area is very nice, however overlooks some tourist shops."

I am updating my review a little bit based on the owner's clarification. I am not changing my review because the owner answered but because we are living hard times and I consider we shouldn't judge an entire business based on one of their dishes only. The staff is very nice and kind, and they respect the COVID-19 measures. Thanks to the owner for the clarification, not everyone takes the time to do it."

The food really was very good but we just did not feel welcome and our waiter never seemed to be around even though it wasn't busy. We literally saw the guy once. We just really didn't like the vibe the staff gave. We're always in the area and have tried other restaurants around here and they've all been warm and welcoming. Not this place. Really disappointed."

And for starters we had caprese salad, bruschetta, and stuffed eggplant. Highly recommend if you're in the area!"

We really enjoyed the food and the nice music playing of Andrea Bocelli added to the ambiance. The service was good. We must all try to support the restaurant industry.

Derrick K.,/user_details?userid=PavBx8J9dllsWVNBdPA-VA,"San Francisco, CA",4/1/2019,2,"The only positive things I have to say about my order are that the bread was fresh, and the food was thermonuclear hot. They must have a really good microwave. The spaghetti sauce tasted canned. The pappardelle was overcooked and bland as hell. I'm glad the utensil packets came with salt and pepper. The order was delivered, and unfortunately it seemed like they did what lots of places do to delivery orders; send out subpar food & give you something other than what you ordered without asking if it's ok, because they know you're unlikely to call them on it unless you live close by. Plain broccoli was substituted for the broccolo, which on the menu states that it's supposed to be broccoli rabe sauteed in garlic and olive oil."
W W.,/user_details?userid=q5_tC_nm7El1djrODsRHkQ,"Alexandria, VA",8/6/2021,4,"3 stars for food/price, 5 stars for ambience/music, therefore 4 stars. The spaghetti alla carbonara was tasty, but even in NYC I can do better than $21 for lunch for the quality. The oldies love songs cheered me up over the cost-benefit analysis, though, so I grant an extra star for the ambience."

Came here in the evening during the summer and opted for the outdoor seating and the ambience is just lovely. I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara and it was one of the best spaghetti I ever had and it was very flavorful. It comes with onions and prosciutto in cream sauce. For drinks, I got the Espresso Martini and the White Chocolate Old Fashion, and they are both spot on. Great service! Great food! Highly recommended. Will definitely be back to try other dishes."

We absolutely love this restaurant! My daughter and I always order the Rigatoni Vodka with chicken. It's so tasty and delicious. On previous visits we've had the bruschetta which is also great. My daughter loves the Limoncello Flute for dessert. I normally opt for the Rumchata coffee drink. If your in Little a Italy definitely give this place a try.

The owner came over and had a conversation with us and she was extremely kind and I am grateful business has been steady for this place because it's my favorite.

Straight from the freezer, super greasy and not close to being homemade. Waiters were atrocious, counting some orders double and serving creamy pesto pasta which is a far cry from Italian cuisine. It may be Little Italy but very little Italian to be found. Even completely lost in New York, Kevin Mcallister would not find his way here."

Dirk R.,/user_details?userid=MgLz-9maE-GP2ibMffx_eg,"Washington, DC",5/18/2018,2,"So so. The people are very nice. They welcomed us on a very busy night and took good care of us. But the food was average at best. The Caprese was downright bad: the tomatoes were green, the mozzarella was tasteless and chewy. The Carbonara was ok, although probably reheated in the oven or microwave. But it tasted ok. The ravioli were also ok. Glass of Pinot Grigio USD 11, I guess we are in Little Italy. On top of it it was freezing cold and windy inside (!) because they had packed the restaurant so much that they couldn't close the windows. Bottom line: good people, spoiled by too many tourists."
Rosh L.,/user_details?userid=vd6YKUkRIUCj1SweBxmi5A,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",8/19/2020,5,"Great service, charming corner location, EXCELLENT Homemade Gluten free Pizza (as good as Kesté or Uncle Sam's - two of the BEST in Manhattan). Enjoy people watching and the great music they play here. Ask for the lovely server who is from Turkey , she is the best! This is the best homemade pizza in Little Italy but for all the rest, I'm loyal to Paesano's and Il Cortile."
Ryan C.,/user_details?userid=_71UzNDM2xQx4Daxd2e9CA,"Yonkers, NY",1/2/2021,5,The lobster ravioli and the regular ravioli were amazing. The service was great and the food came out very fast. Will return to this restaurant for sure.
Andy D.,/user_details?userid=6_ec3h-Gyk1FvxucfllILA,"Miami, FL",9/26/2021,5,Best pasta and Myner is the best server at this place. Much respect to him on taking care of 8 tables at the same time and treating everyone with respect and making your time at this restaurant the best.
G S.,/user_details?userid=RosF_4Le4qOFj4TcyKF9fA,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",7/28/2020,3,"To be honest, I've never actually tasted any good Italian food in Little Italy. Maybe I'm biased because I am Italian and know what genuine, authentic Italian food should taste like, but despite the ""excellent reviews"" and ""high star rating"" of this particular restaurant, the quality and authenticity wasn't there in any of the meals we ordered. The calamari was rubbery and over cooked, the $28 spaghetti with shrimp was merely mediocre, and the sausage with broccoli rabe? It was just plain awful. I wasn't too hungry to begin with, but the dish itself was lacking in actual flavor. The taste of garlic that should be a key component to this dish was nonexistent, and the sausage itself? It tasted awful! It was similar in texture and taste to the type of sausage you'd get on a slice of pizza. That's not what I was going for at all! The pasta wasn't fully ""Al Dente."" The pasta was either too mushy or too hard; there was no in-between here. The attention, precision, and care that should've been put into the food preparation was evidently not there. Their outdoor set up, however, was pleasant.  My only question and concern, however, is why they decided it would be a good idea to place cacti in the flowerpots next to their dining patrons. I must've pricked my arm at least three times! Frankly, I think I'll stick to having the Italian food I prepare at home with my family than anything in tourist trap Little Italy."
Aria L.,/user_details?userid=Wrry1jS6SVZLeVOsP3UnTw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9/17/2021,2,First we sat down and the table was pretty wobbly and the music was extremely loud but i didn't think too much of it. Then we were given bread and it tasted incredibly strongly of perfume and was inedible. They served us water with a sprig of mint inside which was nice but honestly tasted like freezer and I physically gagged. I ordered the rigatoni menanzare and it was great but I won't come here again. What is an italian restaurant without good bread??!
Rene M.,/user_details?userid=_IdUDU_m-A2CSiuvX9FYiA,"San Antonio, TX",12/15/2019,5,"Great spot with a lot of history. Gangster Joey Gallo was gunned down at this very spot. We wanted some homemade pasta and were greeted by a hospitable host, Emiliano. He answered any questions we may have had and rexommended the pasta sampler, which i had. It was amazing!  Particularly the gnocci in pesto sauce. My girlfriend had the spaghetti and meatballs and that was great as well. I'd highly recommend this place."

Sharon O.,/user_details?userid=MCeUxLIOyGGCDFXwRAgikw,"Bloomfield, NJ",12/26/2017,5,"This is a cute Italian restaurant in Little Italy. The portions for the lunch specials are quite large and plenty to share. My mom, sister and I shared a pizza (you can do half-half, different toppings), and eggplant Parmesan (comes with salad and pasta). Everything was made fresh, and the cheese was especially delicious. The service was also great-- very quick and attentive."

Not only did we get top quality seating indoor/outdoor it was at the corner of the whole restaurant/street and we felt just at home! Servers waiters and food was top notch! Will be back! Big shout out to the guy out front ushering is in! Big plus! Food was excellent
Brittney M.,/user_details?userid=fSIvo9X6uFBIQrFwNrP6gw,"Syosset, NY",9/4/2021,3,Pasta is okay for flavor; definitely not great but a good spot to try. The hostess constantly asks people to move or pulls tables apart to make room for other people; the setting felt very rushed and you don't have time to enjoy your food because people are constantly standing over you. Server was very sweet and accompanying but the hostess really kills the customer service.

It is located on the corner of Mulberry Street and the perfect entrance to a walk through memory lane of Little Italy.

A lovely (not pushy) gentleman ushered us inside and we were sat quickly. We ordered a carafe of the house Pinot Grigio with our food and i'm not exaggerating when I say we received the best service of our lives. The wait staff was extremely attentive, we never had to refill our own water or wine glasses the roughly two hours we were there. The food, wine and free bread was all delicious and our waiter was super friendly. Will definitely be going back."

The servers are all kind and attentive and the atmosphere is authentic. I can't speak any higher about the food. From the Caesar Salad to the fettuccine Alfredo it was amazing! If there's one legit critique, it's that I had to ask for bread with oil & vinegar as it wasn't automatically brought to the table."
Lauren H.,/user_details?userid=v82i1_RY0UNdUYnAzfqh-A,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/11/2020,5,"Delicious and cozy spot in Little Italy. The service is great, the staff is so friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. In the warmer weather, they open up the windows and there is outdoor seating. The food is mouthwateringly good, and this is definitely my favorite italian restaurant in the city. They also offer gluten free pasta, which is amazing! Walking down Mulberry street you pass so many options and it can be overwhelming, with hosts stopping you to ask you to read the menu and promises of ""if you don't enjoy your meal it's on us!"" but Da Gennaro is the best restaurant in Little Italy."
Mike P.,/user_details?userid=g8MQgC7EVnz4ppmffUOb_A,"Oakley, CA",6/5/2019,5,Today in my visit  in New York I wanted to try out Da Gennaro Italian Restaurant   Maybe some where down the line we have family history within the name but the restaurant deserves the 5 stars hands down. Walked in off the street for two and was given this cute little table inside the restaurant with doors open to the patio. A great setting for dinner. The style of the establishment is well decorated old style charm.  Started off with some drinks. Gennaro fresh. Made with vodka cucumber and mint. Refreshing. Smoked manhatten was the next drink. Made with smoke bullit bourbon and bitters. Very good. We had a Freese salad with Gorgonzola and walnuts  dressed with a garlic vinaigrette. Amazing. Also had the mussels in a garlic wine sauce that came to the table in its own pot still steaming.  Absolutely incredible. The mrs. Had spaghetti con polpette   Very tasteful   Noodles perfectly light and cooked to perfection. The meatballs were charred just perfectly on the outside while the inner meatball was tender and flavorful mixed with fresh basil. I had the Lasagna Della. Baked in its own tray straight from the oven. Made with an amazing meat sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese. I gotta say. I was highly impressed with the meal.  I have tried many Italian places and compared to grandmothers dishes and this comes way close to home. We ended with a affogato and a pistachio coppa The espresso served with a scoop of vanilla cream was so delicious. The pistachio coppa  is an absolute must. I would have licked out the glass if I could. Lol. Excellent. Our wait staff was amazing. Valeria and Victor took such good care of us. Attentive. Great customer service. Great recommendations. A pleasure with conversation. Just made the whole dinner experience delightful. I will definitely make this a place to visit again when back in New York. Bon Appetit'
Mike N.,/user_details?userid=HkE0TMK59cSsBmr8WI47BA,"Brooklyn, NY",8/3/2020,4,Outdoor dining is fantastic. Had very low expectations coming to Little Italy but the food was surprisingly amazing. Taking one star off for poor beer selection (:
Kim F.,/user_details?userid=H3ms7OtyLnF_7k93kNE4FA,"Maricopa, AZ",11/1/2019,5,The best Italian food we've ever had. AMAZING lasagne and Chicken Parmigiana. Delicious! Don't pass this place up! Great service! Great environment.

It was the evening on July 4th and it was packed with people and yet the wait time was negligible. The staff was very friendly and polite despite there being an overwhelming number of people. We were told upon our arrival that there might be some delays in the food since they were busy but we did not have to wait for the food long at all. I was here with my friends and we orders gnocchi al pesto, penne alla vodka , bruschetta and portobello mushrooms. Least to say the food was mighty delicious. The place is nicely located and the ambience is great! We sat by the big open windows and the street view pretty. The drinks are amazing. If the cocktail menu confuses you, go for the espresso martini! One of the very best espresso martinis I've had in a long time!"

They don't even offer the lunch menu unless you request it, make sure to do so(it's a huge difference). The service isn't the best either. I ordered the chicken franchise off the lunch menu, it's decent but almost no taste of lemon. Also they charged me for a regular order of chicken franchise, I had to correct them on the bill.

Kristen W.,/user_details?userid=1T3SYRsF0proLOfCwykfyQ,"New York, NY",12/30/2019,4,"I came her this past Friday with a group of 8. I had family from out of town visiting, and some of them have dietary restrictions, including being Gluten-Free. So after many yelp searches, we decided on this place since they had a lot of GF options. We had a reservation and good thing we did because they were very busy. It is a big restaurant and we were seating in a room on the side which was great because we had more privacy. The food was good, not the most amazing Italian ever, but very good none the less. The GF people also enjoyed their food and options. A classic staple in Little Italy and I recommend."
Elaine K.,/user_details?userid=YcTJcD2TvDeB0yrrinVWSQ,"Tewksbury, MA",10/5/2020,5,As a single diner sometimes it's easy to feel lonely. Not here!! At Da Gennaro's I was welcomed with opened arms at first by Masy and then by Basia. My experience here was overwhelming by the personal connection they made with me and the attentiveness of all the staff. The food and drinks were delicious and reflected the friendly atmosphere of all the staff! Thank you all for your graciousness and hospitality!! I came back a second time during the short trip because it is well worth it!! See you soon
Jessica F.,/user_details?userid=omn1aopzlYE7wJAZT3ZEoQ,"Sacramento, CA",2/8/2019,5,The food was amazing! My sister and I decided to stop in for dinner after a long day of sightseeing and we were greeted by friendly staff. I had the Lobster Ravoli and my sister had lasagna. We were both impressed and would definitely come back! George are server was also great!
Joanne W.,/user_details?userid=abHSwae69Rqi5vk7gvIdFQ,"Putnam Valley, NY",1/2/2020,3,Went here during the Christmas holiday week. Had a reservation which allowed to be seated on time which was nice. We were led to small side room which worked out well for our group of 8. Had the sangria which was delic! Ordered the meatball appetizer which were in my opinion not great. Others in the group were not so dissatisfied. Ordered the seafood risotto which again was ok. A little dry. Others had two of the GF pasta choices which they liked. Several of us had an after dinner Expresso Martini which was excellent ! Service was very inconsistent. Our Main server seemed at times a little impatient and frustrated with us! Took several asks to get additional sets of utensils. There was one server who kept coming over to table looking at us and the table and checking out what was going on and then walking away.

Kim X.,/user_details?userid=yVS0746EB5gBNGE8FG5p-w,"New York, NY",9/20/2018,3,"This place was bustling during the San Gennaro festival. They were busy, but was able to keep the tables turning to the point where the dishwashers weren't keeping up with the demand. Our wine was served in plastic cups. It was expensive for the amount -about 12 dollars for a very small pour. The price wasn't listed on the menu. I got the linguine with the clams, which was just average. It tasted fresh, but it lacked flavor and salt. Our waiter was so overwhelmed that I needed to find him for some Parmesan cheese and pepper. I would probably give this place another chance when they're less busy."
Ilmi H.,/user_details?userid=FM9mOJsoZnRgsUOhJGId1A,"Staten Island, NY",9/24/2021,1,First Off The old lady Who walks around in there has the nastiest attitude very unprofessional I had a party of six it was one of my friends birthday they waited over a half an hour for a salad so I approached The older lady that works in there to tell her the situation she had the nerve to say I know what table your at you were here already three hours instead of saying no problem I'll get someone to help you right away and she seen I was ordering lots of food and may bottles of Champagne I was treating everyone that night then I tell the waiter please bring me the bill it was a pretty nice bill I paid left a great tip I thought everything was ok I walked out and did not see the birthday boy 10 minutes after he comes out I said is everything ok he said yeah they made me pay 18 bucks I said for what he said the Little piece of birthday cake I was so embarrassed they harassed him for 18 bucks after I told the waiter to give me the bill for everything I never felt more uncomfortable in my life I will never go to this place again in a matter of fact I will go to the restaurant across the street and spend $2000 just in spite never go to this place very bad place
Christi P.,/user_details?userid=rUBs43GoGVNkyRudQSAs4w,"Harrison, NJ",9/28/2019,5,First time visiting Little Italy and this place definitely didn't disappoint! Got seated quickly and servers immediately came to our table for drink orders. The pepperoni pizza was great as was the bruschetta! The best part though was the dessert! The Coppa Pistachio was AMAZING! It was vanilla and pistachio gelato with chocolate drizzle and pistachio bits on top. I would go back for that alone! Only thing I must warn you about is that a pigeon might fly in since the windows and doors are wide open (however the servers are super quick at shoo'ing them out lol)
Shiyu L.,/user_details?userid=JHTQbQ4gAj8uTotXkS5JOw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/26/2019,5,I stopped by on a Tuesday night around 11pm and I was dying for pizza. I was very happy to find out there is still some authentic Italian restaurant open. I ordered the pepperoni pizza with mushroom and I love it!
Cyndi M.,/user_details?userid=no7CUoqrlpLYAntED6aN6A,"Bronx, NY",7/20/2020,5,Their outdoor dining setup is very cute and the tables are very spaced out so I felt very comfortable eating here.  We were served quickly and all staff were super friendly and kind. The food was great - I ordered eggplant parm and it was cooked perfectly.    I'd absolutely go back again.
Bradley B.,/user_details?userid=vqHyLuAtcQHJ7P1wT11xVA,"Somerville, NJ",7/26/2021,5,Came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday night. Mario was our server and the service was absolutely phenomenal. He went out of his way for us to make sure our experience was great. Will definitely be back!
Jessica P.,/user_details?userid=8wRLIQQIlVxD8cJN6iOA9A,"Hickory, NC",6/4/2020,5,We went to nyc in March and wanted to find an authentic Italian restaurant in New York so we went to Da Gennaro and it was amazing! I had the fettuccini alfredo and it was the best I've ever had and my wife had a pasta with zucchini in it and loved it. The service was five star! Highly recommend if your in nyc!

Marysol R.,/user_details?userid=z8zp6mwpPzHWmYmWHQsqpw,"Tyler, TX",1/3/2019,4,First time visiting New York! Looked on yelp to guide our visit around Little Italy. The host sat us at a table and offered us water and bread. We ordered fettuccine chicken Alfredo and shrimp linguine. THE BEST EVER. MUST have. The only reason we gave it a four-star is because of the refill charge on beverages.
Kurtis J.,/user_details?userid=F3xcwndxvF1OcDBSmHmg7A,"Etobicoke, Toronto, Canada",4/21/2019,4,"Good Italian food in Little Italy. Descent sized portions. Although no wood-oven, the pizza was still good. Excellent olive oil. Pricing wasn't justified entirely, however."
Shane H.,/user_details?userid=HkLFguxzPlsWYbJOG7M91A,"Washington, DC",9/6/2020,4,"Ate here for dinner while visiting Little Italy. I had the chicken parm, which was fantastic, and everyone else in my group enjoyed what they had. The menu was reasonably priced, but our waiter could have been a little more attentive. In all, it was a positive experience."
Tes M.,/user_details?userid=Iik5tEmkLCGDbNQRqkPJ9w,"Honolulu, HI",12/27/2018,5,"We were turned on to this restaurant after taking a ""Free Walking Tour on Foot"". We learned the story of this locations past as Umbertos Clam House and the demise of Joe Gallo. We decided to try it out even though the prices were a little higher than we were planning. We are SO happy we went! Our waitress Valerie was extremely helpful and attentive, not to mention her accent as a true Napoli native was awesome and made our experience feel so authentic. I ordered the Cheese Ravioli and shrimp and it is the best I have ever had. If we could afford to eat it every day in New York we would. We were blown away by this dish!"

Eugene C.,/user_details?userid=6pUxJ02ZzAJPJWWqZ1vJXw,"New York, NY",7/4/2018,3,"I usually don't eat in Little Italy because I've been told by friends that the places there are a bit of a tourist trap and that for more authentic Italian food, Arthur Avenue in the Bronx is where you should go. But I went to Da Gennaro recently because I had a friend in town who went there the other night and really enjoyed the pasta and wanted to try the pizza there. So I went there with some friends, we each get a different pizza. I got the broccoli and sausage pizza and I traded a slice of one of my friend's pizza. The pizza was fine in terms of taste. Nothing spectacular. Honestly, I've had better pizza at some of the more well known brick oven places across the city. I would totally give this place 4 stars if I weren't such a big proponent of food quality in relation to cost. The pizza wouldn't be on the list of pizza places I'd recommend people hitting up while in town. Actually, in mid review, I saw that this place is gluten free according to other yelpers. Maybe that's why the pizza was only okay. Everything else was great. The service was great. The ambiance is great. There are a lot of outdoor tables, which is right on the street. Great for people watching, if you're into that kind of thing."
Kelly L.,/user_details?userid=J14uhsq1ijAKAO0onYRPfA,"Queens, Queens, NY",6/25/2020,5,Love the food and atmosphere here !! The severs are so nice and respectful!!  Mussels with the wine is the best !!

We've tried every variety of Italian offerings, breads, pizza, pasta, meats, veggies, wine, and cocktails.  Not one complaint ever. The service is as good as the food.  There is a full bar, indoor and outdoor seating, and a good menu selection."

It's first time here and it was great experience. We ordered appetizers for steamed mussels with white wine garlic sauce, pasta for ravioli and spaghetti with meat sauce. I was happy to my friend took me this place and I thought this place is little gem in the area. Our waiter was incredible and food was so tasty. I really enjoyed eat here and definitely go back to try other dishes. This place good for family or your lover."

Michael M.,/user_details?userid=Tcdv6UP-TWs1Gx9Rs9UiLQ,"Granite Bay, CA",12/12/2018,3,"I'm Italian. I grew up eating some of the best Italian food one could eat. My 3 stars is really most people's 4 stars. I travel extensively and I am spoiled with regard to most food groups. Da Gennarro is above average in food, service and location. Our server was excellent. The food was average for my tastes but the location is really cool. I'd recommend Da Gennaro especially for the bread and meatballs. Marginal. Average. Disappointing."
Diana A.,/user_details?userid=a_6gPXxR59hZcSVto2AMCg,"Hialeah, FL",7/14/2018,5,"Very delicious Italian food! I'm a huge fan of pizza and pasta so I had to come try some from the famous little Italy! After walking around and discretely looked at what everyone was eating at each restaurant, I felt that this was the best option for us. To start off we had bread to dip in the olive oil, and a gas of water. The water was a little too hot for me, considering that we were eating outside. I ordered a chicken Alfredo ($5 extra for the chicken) and a margarita pizza and added pepperoni since they didn't have a regular pepperoni ($4 extra for the add on). We got the food relatively fast, and all I can say was WOW. My boyfriend and I split the two entrees so we can have a little bit of both, definitely worth it! The crust was very thin, the pizza was full of flavor. The chicken on my pasta was cooked to perfection and with great flavor, the pasta was delicious I swear my mouth is getting watery just thinking about it. It was a little pricey for just pasta and a pizza but it was worth it"

Cute greeter girl literally pulling people off the street to go in and eat. Italian music and a fun mix of locals and tourists. Possible the best spaghetti and meet balls I've ever had. I stole a bite of my wife's lasagna and it was incredible too. They really pack the people in there but it's part of the charm. We wanted as close to an authentic Italian experience as we could get and we found it. We'll for sure be back.

I walked around in Italy for the first time with a friend visiting New York for the first time and so glad I did. We saw this cute restaurant and had pasta. I was craving spaghetti and meatballs and I am so glad I ordered it here. It was the best spaghetti and meatballs I have had in my life. The area was so quaint and really nice, it was crowded and packed for a weeknight and we were lucky we got the last table outside. The service was fast too. I feel like the meatballs where home made you can tell it was packed with so much flavor. The sauce was so rich as well. I finished everything on my plate and sometimes I crave for that specific dish when I am craving pasta. I love this place and will recommend this place to anyone and will even come back for lunch if I have major cravings for pasta. This is a must go to place since it is in little Italy. You will feel like you left New York for a second and are walking around in Europe. I loved every minute."

We wanted to sit outside but seemed like a wait but sitting inside was not a problem. Service was friendly and accommodating, he constantly made sure if we needed anything and if our meal was going well. We had three pasta dishes, burrata salad, and brushetta - they were all delicious. We also paired our meal with Malbec which I highly recommend. The vibe and atmosphere was cozy I'm really glad I found this place."
Karen H.,/user_details?userid=qZW_m37qjYtJeckOT6iBYQ,"New York, NY",8/5/2016,3,Lots of tables outside but it does get busy so service could've been a bit better. They seemed very rushed when taking our orders and we had to ask for the bread. Chicken and eggplant parm were pretty good. Was annoyed they didn't list the price of glasses of wine and sangria. Carafe of sangria came out to $32 which is around what I thought it'd be. Nice on a summer day.

We were walking and just randomly picked this place to dine in. The food was excellent! They have the best grilled octopus I have tried so far. It was nice evening in the city that we sat somewhat outside which we enjoyed. My only issue was that I felt rushed. But that's what happens when your dinning in the busy streets of little Italy. Just to warn you they are a bit pricey but if your looking for quality eats you will get it Da Gennaro.

Let me just say that Da Gennaro whit his welcoming introduction by the maître d' Andrew and our excellent service with Emmanuel met and exceeded all of our expectations . We started with the grilled octopus with farro and parsley and a burrata since they told us about the handmade cheese, every part of our meal what's like a dream come true. For the Main course my father had the filetto di Manzo and I had the lobster ravioli... Incredible,  a place and experience to remember!!! We have plans of coming back every year now."

Gillianna V.,/user_details?userid=bsjJsrb6EN6raavkftZUSg,"Orlando, FL",5/29/2016,2,The host of the place is super welcoming however the services was horrible. The bread never came to us until we asked for after getting our food. We asked for cheese never came until we were almost done. The sangria glass is 11$. The lady we got her shirt was all dirty. I order clams in a bitter sauce is was chicken broth super weird disliked it but other might like it.

I couldn't remember what I had then, but this time I ordered the lobster ravioli and a salad. My boyfriend had shrimp ravioli and we ordered a bottle of Lambrusco. Place was very packed I assume to the delicious food and that it's also fairly inexpensive. I love sitting outdoors and I've been to Italy so it feels just like I was there. My only suggestion is the bread was a bit hard could be much softer and they were very slow in taking our order. Other then that the food is delicious and this is one of my secret favorite Italian restaurants."

It was a little cramped but the food was spectacular. This place had the absolute best fettuccine Alfredo that I have ever tasted in my life!!!! Like I can't even describe how perfect it was!!! Like my god!!!!! My wife was amazed then had me try it and I was just like wow. I was in heaven. I ordered the lasagna which was fine but nothing special. That fettuccini though!!! My goodness!!! Will be back!
Andy H.,/user_details?userid=-MMKSWwfFRu0acODQlNrXg,"Nashville, TN",8/7/2018,4,"Three Words: True Italian Food. When you walk in it looks a little cramped, but it's GOOD food; not the best I've ever had but still good. So you're at the table anxiously awaiting the food. Now you ask yourself, ""What do I order??"" Well your service is great, so your waiter is there pretty quickly. The food that we ordered was Spaghetti and Meatballs, Plain Pasta, Ravioli de Napoli, Chicken Marsala, Portabello Mushrooms, and Calamari. And then after you finish your main course you will want to get the tiramisu. This was not the best tiramisu but definitely deserves second place! Good for smaller families, table for one and table for two. If you love Italian food this is the place for you!"
Carol K.,/user_details?userid=Udrk4c4zXS1VLGEFt0d7GA,"Denton, TX",1/4/2020,2,Service sucked. Food was super average. Go anywhere else for a better experience. Dirty tables. Not impressed.

Krista W.,/user_details?userid=JBLEikTrw6R1yaJgSM8i2g,"Fuquay Varina, NC",12/28/2018,5,My favorite Italian restaurant in Little Italy.  The BEST food and The BEST service!!! I never even attempt to try another place as I know there is not a bad dish to be had.
Jacqueline T.,/user_details?userid=oFs1phYKrp_DO_prnAe63w,"Los Angeles, CA",10/27/2019,5,"Small, cozy, intimate place. It feels very warm and family oriented. The owner walked around asking how things were and the food was ahamzing! Everyone at the table got something different and I promise no ones meal failed them! 5 star!"
Shazia K.,/user_details?userid=o_X3RflbgVXxb1MgW1r_MA,"JAMAICA, NY",6/28/2018,4,"Food was surprisingly good. Most of the places in little Italy, just give you jar sauce fake pasta. Not here!!"

Antonella R.,/user_details?userid=6EH3-BMOM-92Sym0NRUR-w,"Miami, FL",8/29/2019,3,"Went there on a weekday night just because it was the fullest restaurant on the street so we thought it would be good. It wasn't really.. First the tables are super small and really close to the next table so they can fit more people, not the most comfortable space to eat. Our waitress was nice but we felt that she was hurrying us as soon as we sat down, I kinda felt in a fast food place and I don't even think this was her fault, I think this is just how the place works. Bread was old and chewy. Food came out extremely quick which only makes me think its pre-made and reheated (pasta pre-made? Yeah.. WOW) and was simple and unflavored. To top the experience, this place is not cheap at all, even for NYC, you could be spending your money at 10 other different Italian restaurants where you would actually enjoy your dinner."
Aixa A.,/user_details?userid=_w-gjZRs9JsPBS8ko31_5Q,"Hialeah Gardens, FL",12/30/2019,5,Great quality service and delicious food! Wide variety of wines and spirits. Our waiter Elvis was super nice and attentive. Would definitely go back!

I also ask for it to be made in an Alfredo sauce wish fresh mozzarella which isn't on the menu. But, so yummy!"

MJ H.,/user_details?userid=YAwQUeQgnQ-LgiSAGU97PA,"Manhattan, NY",7/5/2018,5,Stopped here for dinner while in the area. We were seated right away. I had the linguine alla vongole dish except I substituted the linguine for gluten free penne. It was absolutely delicious! They also have gluten free pizza. Outdoor seating here is really nice in warm weather and great for people watching if that's your thing.

This was by far our favorite. Right when we walked into little Italy we were greeted with a friendly smile (Louis). He was so kind and friendly that we decided to go into Da Gennaro. The atmosphere, the service was absolutely fantastic. Elvis, our waiter was superb. He was also very nice to our 8 year old who was asking a lot of questions.. We loved our experience here. Many thanks from Nashville TN."

It's ironic that little Italy doesn't always offer the best Italian food in the city! if I have to eat at little Italy I'll probably trust this place!"
Nada K.,/user_details?userid=SnAi_Kol73ccRF8Wy4tZ4Q,"Garland, TX",4/29/2018,5,This is probably the best Italian food I've had in the US. A must visit in little Italy.

First, the gentleman at the door made you feel like family. Great way to start the night. We had a party of 7 for my Daughters Bday and the service was outstanding. I ordered the seafood pasta with red sauce.  This included lobster,clams, mussels, stone crab, shrimp, and scallops. The wine list is good as is the prices. I will definitely come back and visit."

We ordered the prosciutto pizza and the rigatoni alla vodka and it was to die for. The pasta was sooo flavorful and delicious and the pizza was authentic tasting Italian pizza. If you go you have to try these two. It was by far the best Italian food I've ever eaten.

It was one of the worst meals I have ever had at an Italian restaurant. The ""prosciutto"" was ham, the sauce was very bland. My son had gnocchi that were tough. The service was very inattentive. They brought out bread with no butter or olive oil. Had to ask for olive oil. The pasta dishes are overpriced even by NYC standards. Terrible dining experience- a tourist trap."

Ate on a Friday night and they messed up my reservation and forgot a drink order, but were apologetic and generally polite. Overall, good for a casual start to a night."

They have a large outside seating area, and our server was very nice and prompt. The guy that helped with bussing the tables was a bit odd though. When he brought out bread and we asked for butter, he said they didn't have any, but then eventually brought some that was slapped on a side plate. The salad and soup two of us started with were quite large (especially the soup, it was a huge bowl) and the pastas were all very large portions. When our entrees arrived, the guy who bussed the tables asked to remove the oil & vinegar and then took the salt without asking, and it was weird to me that there was no pepper on the table. If you wanted pepper, you had to ask for it and they would grind it over your plate. I enjoyed my pasta dish, but two of the others in our party weren't as enthusiastic about their dishes. I'd return if someone else in my party wanted to come here, otherwise I'd try another place in Little Italy in the future."

The girl out front was sweet and amazing. The owner walked around and was involved asking us about our meal. Everything was perfect! We had their meatball appetizer and it was amazing. They melt in your mouth. My girlfriend had the rigatoni ala vodka which she loved and said the grilled chicken was perfectly seasoned with an amazing vodka sauce. I had the chicken parm which was the best I ever had honestly. Thin and delicious the way I love it. Service here was also excellent.
Lindsay Anne H.,/user_details?userid=oNslVmP5KBNMt-1Xyhzfaw,"Charlotte, NC",10/26/2018,5,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! We could not stop eating and had to ask our waiter to take the food away! The food was incredible, service was great (ask for Miguel) and the wine was perfect. You can just tell them what you are looking for and they will cook it up. The ambience is great and they were not begging us to come in like some other restaurants near by (which was a big turn off for us)."
Jessica B.,/user_details?userid=y1vK_rx_FAEk8Wa2lQvIeQ,"Bergenfield, NJ",9/22/2019,3,"Came here yesterday for dinner during the San Gennaro food festival. Firstly it took forever for someone to come to our table and even ask us for drinks. We never received any bread for starters which I saw other people post pictures of that wrote reviews... we ordered the pesto gnocchi with $6 extra for chicken. The amount of chicken given for $6 was way too pricey. Also ordered the angel hair pasta with veggies which was just OK. We were recommended to this spot by someone to try out. I love pesto so I really liked the gnocchi it was soft had good flavor to it. For drinks the moscato was good and the blood orange martini was also nice. I don't know if I would return back here because service was also awful here. We had to ask for utensils. We had no napkins. We weren't even asked if we wanted dessert they just handed the check to us thinking we were finished. I would think for the prices that we are paying you'd atleast receive somewhat of a decent service, I guess not."

The food was okay, nothing special, but overpriced for the serving size. We ordered the spaghetti with marinara sauce and the CANNELLONI RIPIENI ALL'AMALFITANA. The cannelloni said it had meat, but we didn't see or taste any. Service wasn't great. Took a long time to get water refills. I would want to give this place another try but I don't think I will because its overpriced and overrated."
Damian P.,/user_details?userid=RXi-zuQioJJCJRc2q9FkKg,"Beverly Hills, FL",12/7/2018,5,Favorite place to go when in little Italy. Great food service and the manager was attentive and checked on us more than enough to make sure food was on point and everything was good. Calamari was perfect melted in your mouth like butter. The meatballs were perfect with the ricotta on tops they nailed it ! Got the scollopini veal we will see joe it is
Victor B.,/user_details?userid=8NQE6as68bbXvyMN-0TLZA,"New York, NY",8/24/2019,5,"I've been here several times in the past with my wife but dinner last night was extra delicious and perfect. The service here was excellent. It was a little crowded but it was a beautiful Friday evening so that's to be expected. We started with baked clams and the grilled octopus which was soooooo good along with some wine. I ordered the spaghetti alla bolognese which was absolutely delicious especially since I was craving pasta. We also ordered the chocolate suffle for desert with a cappuccino. Like I said earlier, it was the perfect meal- so good that I had to write about it."
Olga C.,/user_details?userid=wPEKMGyFwYgGGJt4wC4WOQ,"Fort Myers Beach, FL",3/29/2019,5,BEST Italian food we've all have had in a while. The service was outstanding - Victor took excellent care of us and he's multilingual! We were a group so different  dishes were ordered and not one of us had any complaints about the quality of the food or the service from the moment we got there until we left 2.5 hours later! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT if you're in the area...and we know Italian;)
Nicole M.,/user_details?userid=O0Ybk-iWDy72DoaNQjmshQ,"New York, NY",8/7/2018,5,"The food was amazing and I liked the ambience of the restaurant. There are also many seats outside so it would be nice to eat outside if the weather was not so hot. Everyone was nice and friendly. The portion is really big too, and I eat a LOT. I highly recommend you try the pasta I had. I was told that it is one of the bests and it was actually really good that when I first put it in my mouth I was like OMG this is really good! The con: the price was somewhat expensive but I think it was worth it."

Walked by Da Gennaro & the young gentleman, named Leo, gestured he will get us a table. We were so glad we chose this place. Food was great! My daughter had the salmon with linguini & she said it was better than Carmine's. (My cousin celebrated her 50th bday at Carmine's the night before. Sorry Carmine's) Waitress recommended the chicken gennaro & I loved it! We had an awesome & memorable Father & Daughter dinner! Special thanks to Leo! He has a great attitude towards people & I hope God blesses that young gentleman & his family with abundant Love, Peace, & Joy. Hope the owner of the restaurant rewards him for what he does for others. And Tobias too. Very respectful & courteous young man! More blessings to Da Gennaro & their staffs! God is good!!!"

Ari L.,/user_details?userid=f_tnXODTwuMhK17g5akffg,"Odenton, MD",6/29/2019,3,"Very touristy. That about sums it up. No drink list- meaning when you order soda you are unaware that they charge you per cup. Ok, didn't know we were in ""real Italy"", difference is, in Italy they give you a whole can or a bottle of soda and ice on the side. I know it's just soda but that irritated me. I ordered the minestrone soup- best one I've ever had. It was a large portion, too. Their pastas were a 2 star - Olive Garden is better. Sad but true. This strange guy who kept pacing back and forth kept coming to our table to remove items. First he asked for our oil and vinegar to take to another table, then he took our salt but never asked if we needed it. So strange."
Phet M.,/user_details?userid=5wRY3qx8h7PLxerwMjCCHQ,"Orlando, FL",3/8/2019,5,We are from Orlando FL and came here to have dinner with some from friends who live here and been wanting to try this place.  The food was amazing.  Go check this place out and ask for Elvis to serve you.  He was a joy to have and made our evening and dinner such a treat!!!!!  Don't miss out on this place when visiting the city.

We found this quaint little place to be very busy at lunchtime. We ordered eggplant Parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs. Huge portions and very timely delivery of food after ordering. We additionally ordered the homemade red sangria, excellent! Overall, very authentic Italian dining experience, we would highly recommend!"

Even though I was seated right away the waiting time was too long: first, to place my order, then to get a drink, then to get pizza. I've ordered a Margherita. I don't know how to call what I got... There were no tomatoes, no mozarella and a sad excuse for basil was some shreds of greens. To top off this disappointment, the crust was so hard that I BROKE MY TOOTH  chewing through it. One star is for the kid in the front who greeted me and a other for the manager who owned to my demise and footed the bill. NEVER AGAIN HERE!"

Even a classic Alfredo melts in your mouth. Don't forget dessert...my favorite is the tiramisu. Thank you for the wonderful service, Elvis!"
Vero V.,/user_details?userid=1iJtXpLGcjNZQK0HyPBb3Q,"Miami, FL",8/10/2019,5,Had a great experience at Da Gennaro. Excellent food and excellent service provided by George. Great atmosphere with outside seating. Must try!
Cindy K.,/user_details?userid=vwCUfV4V0FyRrXCcVMX7zA,"Whiteville, NC",3/19/2019,5,I adore Italian restaurants but this one is my new favorite. The service is attentive and the tomato sauce is to die for!! It's like being back in Italy and I can't wait to return!
Mapi R.,/user_details?userid=bRbyq7WzKzr8maRg2lDMIA,"Sunrise, FL",4/19/2018,4,"Staff is very polite, food is excellent I had the melanzana (eggplant in marinara sauce) which was amazing I don't even like eggplant but it was delicious, it  is enough for two people if you're not that hungry. For the main course I had the minestrone it was a bit different than the ones I had before but I guess it's the house's special recipe it tasted like authentic Italian food. The wine was very good it was a Barolo 2012 which made the experience even better I highly recommend this place."

But Da Gennaro I will travel to anytime, its that good! The bread and olive oil they bring out is worth the trip alone. The burrata is some of the best in the city. My favorite is the seafood pasta! The mussels are a great starter. Leave some room for their homemade tiramisu."

Lovely music.The waitress was amazing and very knowledgeable of the different types dishes. She was able to explain to me in a way that I knew what exactly in a dish. We ate the dinner for two with the lobster, linguini noodles with pink sauce, clams, mussels, shrimps, and scallops. Everything was amazing and melted in our mouth. We also had some fried clams, which were amazing as well. So fresh and tasty. For my first time in New York I must say great place to eat. Very clean and elegant."
Orange P.,/user_details?userid=SgEGkPBNTBJ2yVn8fBjDLA,"New York, NY",6/26/2017,1,One star for beautiful atmosphere and they have outdoor seating. The service is ok. The waiter was nice. The food here is just terrible. The bread was hard and dry. The olive oil they used was flavorless. The entree I had was very bland and sauce literally flavorless. I had ravioli from chef boy r dee that taste better than this. I really want to like this place too since they are at a prime location and nice decor. For the price they are charging and the quality that they are giving they need to step it up.

Carol H.,/user_details?userid=jwYrobGTYBwdfGqJAMeq6A,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/24/2020,4,Excellent Italian food.  Good Social Table distancing.  Didn't feel rushed. Great Clam Sauce Spaghetti. Mussels in wine sauce was superb. Good portions. Reasonable prices.  Waiter service very attentive.
Caitlin C.,/user_details?userid=aarhWfxDvTTEEx6X-82VZA,"Oxford, PA",12/20/2018,4,"The food is absolutely delicious! I had the ravioli dish and the cheese inside was amazing. The bread served at the table was a little cold and hard, and that is my only complaint. The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite nice and they have it decorated for Christmastime. The waiters, waitresses, and manager are all very kind, and it was quite literally the only restaurant on Mulberry without an employee yelling at you in Italian to come in. Loved it!!"

I can safely say that Da Gennaro changed my mind. It wasn't overpriced and everything was delicious. Our host Andrew was very charming and informed us about the gluten free items on the menu, his suggestions were very helpful. I had the steak with portobello mushrooms... I also tried my friend's raviolis... ups... super yummy and fresh. Great flavors and great service. I'll bring all my visiting friends to this spot from now on :)"

Jodie L.,/user_details?userid=SqH9wGguL5-fho2JMpNM-w,"Brooklyn, NY",11/28/2018,2,Went for a girls night out and I have to say I was not impressed at all. Extremely over priced for pasta with the meat as a side a la carte. I tried the lobster ravioli a total of 6 pieces. Between everyone's food and appetizers I still left hungry and had to get dessert elsewhere. I have to say the oil for the bread is amazing though and we did keep asking for more.

Joe H.,/user_details?userid=j-vKwHxd5b_GXeMDbwukFw,"Manhattan, NY",12/10/2016,3,The atmosphere was nice.  The staff was nice and attentive. The food was ok. I have been here a few times.  The chicken parm had a good sauce and the chicken was a good thickness. The pasta and sauce that came with it was good as well. It's not home made and little Italy isn't what it used to be but I would come for lunch when I am in the area.
Erica D.,/user_details?userid=vMiMj5Zg44WBIhxjL_TxYg,"Oviedo, FL",4/5/2017,4,The pizza we ordered was amazing.  Tasted fresh. Would totally return for the pizza. However I didn't like the tirmasu and the sangria glass could've been bigger. The service was good as well. Would come back again.

We got a great first impression by the hilarious and energetic host who sat us immediately on a Saturday night. We sat outside and it was a beautiful view with all the lights around in Little Italy. The prices were most definitely reasonable, and the food was incredible. There was four of us and we all loved our food, and the portions were perfect where you aren't overfilled if you eat it all, but it's just enough. The service was also awesome, all the staff were friendly and constantly checked in. I wish I lived here so I could come back!"

Sylvia G.,/user_details?userid=WUOx7yv7QkQiDkT5ti74ZQ,"Las Vegas, NV",7/25/2018,4,"My best friend came here and loved it last visit and place was packed so we ended up trying it out over the plethora of places in Little Italy. It definitely met expectation for an Italian restaurant was a little tight in spacing on the tables but we enjoyed the meal and experience. We had the meatballs for appetizer which had a very creamy light topping of ricotta cheese that was super delicious and melted in your mouth. An Arugula salad that had a bitter taste to it and ordered a Papperdelle pasta with scallops in a pesto sauce that we shared that was nothing but delicious. We ordered a bottle of Chilean Pinot for $43  instead of ordering by the glass as the price was just the same if we each ordered 2 glasses of wine.  Wine was very good, smooth and easy to drink with our meal. Service was pretty good server wasnt around too much but i guess that was due to restaurant being so busy but the runners were very friendly, and helpful and jumped in to help guests whenever needed. We started off with a small table for 2 and as soon as a large party next to us left the runners immediately slid another table making us a four top giving us some more space to dine. Would I come back...yes just would stay away from the Arugula Salad."
Marlene M.,/user_details?userid=B8oIodKzhXtj70OyntA4JA,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",8/6/2019,5,The restaurant staff was friendly and patient.  The food was delicious and you get to dine al fresco!  On the corner of Hester & Mulberry for convenience.

I recommend making a reservation ahead of time. Also had the ice cream. I was too full to finish it but it was great. Only complaint was my friends and I were seated way too close to another table. The people sitting close basically had dinner with us and it was a bit uncomfortable. Other than that, great food!"

We were reluctant to choose any restaurant along the festival route because of the ""barkers"" and the restaurants that kater to the tourists who frequent this event. To our surprise and relief Da Gennaro delivered with a great menu, great waiter / service, and price point. We had 4 different items and all were tasty & authentic. Don't wait for the next Feast of San Gennaro to go there!"

Jeanine Z.,/user_details?userid=3Oqft3aAWPHPsKgAwZIF7A,"Brooklyn, NY",9/20/2015,3,"I came to this restaurant while at the San Gennaro feast. We sat inside. It was crowded. We sat down and ordered some wine. They only had three choices by the glass: merlot, Chianti and Pinot Grigio. I wasn't thrilled about that because I don't really like any of those 3. My friend and I ordered a margarita pizza and a salad with chicken to share. The pizza was good. Not great, but good. The salad wasn't really good. I didn't like the dressing. Usually with a salad with radicchio, endive, and arugula, I like a simple oil and vinegar. The dressing was a little heavier. The chicken was also not good. It was kind of tough. The food here was mediocre, in my opinion. The service was good but I probably wouldn't return."
Amy C.,/user_details?userid=HQ1iBRQX9NNM3PaqUIfgOg,"Flushing, NY",9/18/2015,4,"Da Gennaro is the place to be. I have been here 3 times already and have had a great time. The most recent visit was last night during the San Gennaro feast. I met my friend for a late dinner. We definitely had a long day and a sit down dinner was a great choice. We ordered a carafe of pinot. Very nice. Very nice glass of wine. As for our entrees, my friend ordered the pizza capricciosa and I ordered the penne al arabbiata. The food was nice. My friend didn't rave about the pizza and said it was ok. However, my dish was delish. It had a lil kick of heat which I liked. The staff was super friendly and very attentive. We decided to have a lil more wine and ordered half of a carafe of the same. What a nice and relaxing time spent at Da Gennaro. I will definitely be visiting them again."

V F.,/user_details?userid=M_R14-hIdYDkkG9kYkWWKg,"Boonton Township, NJ",12/18/2017,2,"I have visited this restaurant at least three times. Pros: the food comes out quick, the food is hot (temp.) Cons: they pack you in like sardines at the tables, the waiters are very rude, the portions are rather small, the food is overpriced ($22 for spaghetti and meatballs?!?), they do not ask/offer refills on soda, they do not come back to the table to check on the food, and last but not least, the food runner SCREAMS when he announces the food when he brings it to the table. There are so many options to eat on that block.... I would only eat here again if the other places were completey packed."

Of the many places to choose from to eat, we asked for a table at Da Gennaro.  Then we dared ask to change our table from inside to outside, and he sat us next to an EMPTY table 2"" away from the one we sat at. When we asked if we could move that table over just a bit, he stormed off yelling in Spanish (which he obviously didn't realize I speak) that we thought we were queens along with other perfectly inappropriate niceties.

The staff was friendly and efficient. I ordered the chicken Marsala, my husband the chicken Parmesan, as well as the Caesar  salad. The waiter recommended a merlot with our pasta and nothing disappointed. The Caesar was incredible! Lots of flavor and very fresh. The bread and olive oil was amazing, I could eat it forever. The chicken Marsala was pretty good. It comes with 2 pieces of chicken, one if the chickens seemed more flavorful than the other. The pasta and sauce were great, but the best I ever had, but pretty good. The chicken Park was incredible, the sauce was flavorful and hearty, the chicken cooked to perfection and juicy.

Joshua M.,/user_details?userid=EFIERJgDBV7Ch6AuUgKlYg,"Rochester, NY",7/18/2015,5,Da Gennaro is a staple in little Italy. I have been coming here for four years thanks to a very good friends recommendation. Every time I come I get something new. Whether it's the calamari fritte or the gnocchi it is all good. This time I got the pasta fagiole and the pepperdelle dish that was on special. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I drive 6+ hours to get to New York City and Da Gennaro is always one of my first stops. Bellissima!
Allan R.,/user_details?userid=exM8D3LP4oekkl2etzyTLA,"Fondren Southwest, Houston, TX",7/31/2017,5,"This was awesome! Very unique experience here. Located smack dab right and center of Little Italy, a very scenic restaurant. Not elegant or fancy. But makes me feel like i was in a romance movie having a date with my wife. Right off the bat we were swept off the street by an authentic Italiano. We were a big group but they sat us down and made room pretty quickly. Immediately they filled our glasses with still water from a glass bottle leaving it on the table after making sure they were filled. Right after, our waiter came to take our drink orders. My wife was in the mood for wine so she had a very soft and tasty moscato, while I the italian Peroni. Right along with our drinks came the italian bread with olive oil dipping sauce. I love that stuff, can't get enough. For the main course we shared a Chicken Fettuccine alfredo, which was awesome. Great flavor and very filling. Goes to say that we loved this place so much, we came back the very next day. This time we had the pesto gnocchi which was to die for, while my wife had the lasagna which eas very tasty and cheesy and good. If i come back to NY again, you better believe I will visit again."
Amber R.,/user_details?userid=A-PnGDPCeEGBiORBVQr9zg,"Cerro Gordo, IL",12/9/2018,3,"I stopped here on impulse while walking through Little Italy. It was very cute on the outside. Inside was charming, warm but crowded. I got the fettuccine Alfredo and white sangria. I loved the sangria-sweet, adorable,perfect. The Alfredo on the other hand felt bland to me. I had to ask for bread which I was disappointed-I thought it came with the meal. My total was about 49$. I left early because I spotted a rodent overhead and lost my appetite. If it wasn't for Ratatouille, this place may have had 5 stars."

My husband had their homemade lasagna, the sauce had so much flavor as it virtually melted in your mouth. We had an excellent bottle of Sangiovese from Italy and was quite reasonably priced. They bring you bread with olive oil with spices. And they have amazing Italian limocello as well as grappa. The waiters pretty much all had thick italian accents. Definitely did NOT disappoint!!

Riley F.,/user_details?userid=f6NsU6rtYwnwySxIGHRVfw,"Lee's Summit, MO",1/12/2020,5,It was fabulous! Service was excellent but not pushy. I had the meatball panini and my boyfriend had the chicken fettuccine. They were both delicious and the sangria and calamari were excellent as well. I would highly recommend stopping for lunch or dinner when in little Italy.
Lauren G.,/user_details?userid=j5805_aB766gVlnVuCPG-A,"Indianapolis, IN",12/4/2017,5,"We LOVED this place! You simply can't beat the decor and vibe of not only the restaurant but the neighborhood as well. We are visiting NYC for the first time and just adored this restaurant. We did it up- appetizer or bruschetta (with the freshest mozzarella you can imagine), I had the pesto gnocchi (which was DELICIOUS but I struggle to finish) and I added shrimp which was a great decision. My fiancé had the chicken Parmesan and it was the perfect amount. We shared a full carafe of sangria (delicious) and then had the tiramisu and a cannoli for dessert. Both were so good! You are well taken care of when you come in with multiple people refilling your water, taking your plates, offering you pepper or Parmesan... sad that we aren't able to come here more often!"
Gustavo S.,/user_details?userid=N8DnmtEO-xzjIpi5rEfFBQ,"Houston, TX",6/1/2018,5,We went for a couple of drinks and because of the  excellent customer services and we ended up eating appetizers. We tried the bruschetta and calamari and they were excellent... Highly recommended specially if you are st the tables outside just next to the street
James N.,/user_details?userid=UdvaNuoQmC2F5z7rN-6Eng,"Louisville, KY",12/3/2017,5,"Unbleivably good food.  Caesar was very good but the pasta and main course stole the show.  I had the Veal with prosciutto and eggplant with a side of linguine. I may dream about it for a while. The flavors were flawless and harmonious.  My wife and daughter are Celiac and have to eat gluten free. My daughter had gluten free penne bolognese and it was the best gluten free pasta I've ever had, truly tasted like they could have made a mistake and served regular pasta.  Her friend had gnocchi with pesto and it was buttery, and dense full of rich flavor.  My wife had chicken piccata and it was done perfectly.  Cooked just right, not greasy, perfect lemon flavor without being overpowering. All in all, the best Italian meal my family has ever had."
Angelica Desiree R.,/user_details?userid=lA2ClQhpbFx5X-rQYGS1tg,"New York, NY",3/5/2018,5,The lasagna was amazing. They had a lunch special so it was at a great price. I am already craving another one. Service was fantastic. Actually felt like I was in Italy
Lorenzo M.,/user_details?userid=2uL9lnXmKShFJQOrOiYOGw,"San Antonio, TX",1/1/2018,5,"We just had an excellent dinner at this place in the middle of Little Italy, Manhattan. We all thought the place was amazing!!! Every we taste was delicious. I really recommend the Minestrone soup, one of the best I have ever had. The Scallopini all Sorrentina is superb an you should try the Antipasto Gennaro for 2, an excellent seafood appetizer. A bit pricey but well worthy."

I spoke with the host three weeks before our wedding and they were very accommodating. We had 24 people, and the restaurant handled our small crowd very well. We were seated in a side room that was decorated beautifully. Right around Christmas time, there was greenery hung around the brick walls, and beautiful candles lit all over the room. The staff really went out of their way to make the space beautiful for us. We had an amazing view out onto snow-dusted Mulberry Street. We ordered one of just about everything on the menu and thoroughly enjoyed all of it. Everything was fresh and delicious, the drinks were flowing, and our servers took excellent care of us. Thank you, again!"

Michele B.,/user_details?userid=sEjkgVJNQTEgcufNv1CEOg,"Bergen, NJ",4/19/2019,5,"We have been here a few times now and Da Gennaro is our go to Little Italy restaurant. This trip we came into NYC for my daughter's birthday. We ordered the mozzarella Caprese salad, calamari fritti and bruschette. It was all fabulous and ordered another Caprese salad because we enjoyed it so much. My daughters both has soup, one had Pasta e Fagioli and the other Minestrone. I tried them both and they were great. Very large bowls but we ate every bite. We had a delicious Italian valpolicelli wine and Loved it so much we ordered another bottle of it. For dinner we had chicken parmigiana which was a good size and I heard it was delicious. The penne alla Gennaro, linguine alla vongole, farfalle com broccoli rabe e salsiccia and parpardelle special was incredible. The service was very attentive and nice making great recommendations for the food and wine. We enjoyed every bite and will definitely will be back!"
Laura B.,/user_details?userid=JZ3ZYnf40rQoh6bZeESw1Q,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/16/2018,5,Spent the evening learning how to make pasta at one of Da Gennaros cooking classes! What an incredibly fun night making pasta followed by a delicious dinner and wine! (:

Sandy L.,/user_details?userid=KjX17e1oZWraAxjJ7dKHWg,"Newport News, VA",7/30/2018,2,"Starting with a very nice olive oil mix with herbs bread dipping, love it. But the main course were a bit disappointed, the sauce for the sirloin steak and stuffed Veal were too thick and too salty,  overwhelming and over powered the natural favor of the meat itself ,  may be better to put the sauce on the side when you order, not a very good presentation after all. The service is ok......"
Genesis B.,/user_details?userid=V618XNiNsIA56zyApBci6g,"Howard Beach, New York, NY",7/30/2018,5,"I'm from New York and this is my first time in little Italy i wanted to eat real good Italian food and this restaurant caught my eye and I decided to try it.

Liz M.,/user_details?userid=2X7MDV7Ga5Qdgwj89E2stg,"Manhattan, NY",5/20/2015,4,Surprisingly delicious for little Italy which has turned into your run of the mill tourist trap. I ordered the gnocchi with red sauce and it was amazing. My friend ordered the pesto gnocchi and I loved hers too. The low spot was the mozzarella en carrozza for the app. It was under seasoned and nothing to write home about. I'd actually consider going back to little Italy for this place. Very accommodating wait staff.

Freddie R.,/user_details?userid=c-mKCySXf2-TwvbmiitM3g,"Laguna Beach, CA",4/1/2017,1,Came to Little Italy expecting nothing but the best Italian food and My wife ordered chicken fettuccine Alfredo. She totally hated it. No flavor at all on the pasta and she described the chicken as having a weird texture. I tried the pasta and I was waiting for a cheesy flavor to explode and it felt like I was eating pasta with a no name sauce. Nothing........so disappointed. I guess our expectations were too high.

Tish F.,/user_details?userid=TOJ1gSBeCgmusrxm4OU1Qw,"Orlando, FL",8/2/2019,3,"Nice restaurant with a nice ambience. We sat outside and really enjoyed people watching. I had the eggplant and would rate it 3 stars. My hubby had the chicken parm and would rate it 4 stars. My son had the gnocchi with chicken and he rates it 3 stars. The coffee was horrible and wished I hadn't ordered it.  I had the house Chianti, as well as the tiramisu and both were delicious.  Definitely both were 5's.  The service was wonderful and they were definitely on top of it!  Beware that it's not free refills on soft drinks and they come from a fountain. I would come back, although my hubby and son both said they wouldn't."

The food was actually pretty good. Overall just annoyed at the service and our experience. I'm sure other places have just as good of food with better service."

Don't order the Baked Clams as they only give you 6 tiny ones,not even a medium or large sized clam in the dish which is absurd in Little Italy at a cost of $15 when I could of ordered a pizza for the same price."
Fai A.,/user_details?userid=1umITgmAyEZr9lHcdwcidQ,"Seattle, WA",11/10/2016,4,"More like 3.5 stars. As we were strolling in little Italy, we were convinced by one of the employees the try this place out. It was more busy than the rest of yeh restaurants so we thought we would give it a try. It's neat from the inside and dimly lit. The service is also very professional. We ended up ordering the margarita pizza and lobster ravioli. The Margherita pizza was pretty decent, not anything spectacular. On the other hand, the lobster ravioli was delicious! The sauce that it came with was so flavorful and the ravioli was very tasty and soft as well. We ended up getting another ravioli dish with cheese in it and on it, but it wasn't as good as the lobster ravioli. This place isn't a bad option to try, just make sure to order the right pastas!"

I love their soups (pasta E Fagioli) salads (mango, strawberry and arugula) and pasta dishes (sautéed calamari in white wine sauce.) I would highly recommend them for breakfast or brunch too as their menu options are fantastic! One of my favorite restaurants in Little Italy!"
Geronimo G.,/user_details?userid=Dcdm7VcnAo7VqZy1yV6KbA,"Queens, Queens, NY",3/22/2019,5,"OMG... this place SAVED MY TRIP!  So, I live in NYC, but family friends visiting don't.  Before we even got to this place it was a day of tourist hell - the tour bus company the family I was chaperoning was staffed with one incompetent worker after the next. The family I was showing around was just getting more and more miserable.  So - it was time for food.  Well, the first place we went to claimed they had beer but all their beer was warm and nothing but foam.  Did I mention their 5 star hotel they were staying at had horrible service, served powdered eggs and the concierge knew nada?  By the time we got to Da Gennaro it was peak family trip anger.  But omg... the service was SUBLIME!  The food was PERFECTO!  The beer... was COLD!!! lol... The family I was with was so happy they tipped close to 40%.  The family thanked nearly all the waiters, the manager and took business cards.  They have since returned to Florida but can't stop talking about DA GENNARO!!! Seriously!  You know what it's like to take a family psyched to see the Statue of Liberty and nobody tells you you had to get on the 3pm ferry?  And that ferry doesn't even stop there?  But the tour company charges you anyway? It's like, let's meet dirty, chain smoking Elmo in Times Square to see how crappy NYC can be!  Da Gennaro turned that around... I'm stuffed just thinking about it. Go there.  Quaint decor.  Spot on service. Delicious food. Cold beer. And it says something that most of ALL the other Little Itally restaurants were VACANT! Da Gennaro has it going on. Ciao Bella!"

Drue D.,/user_details?userid=i5RCSRXED_cXmEiUWKhE-w,"Scottsdale, AZ",7/9/2015,5,Dropped in to Da Gennaro tonight for dinner. Selecting it among a sea of Italian restaurants made it challenging but the food was fantastic! The bread was great and the oil concoction was so good we took pictures so we can try to recreate it at home.  This place is great. Service was solid and the dishes we all had were top notch!

Patricia B.,/user_details?userid=DDWsPouX1ADpWHzeMko8sw,"North Bergen, NJ",2/17/2019,5,"This place was excellent! I ordered the filet de manzo which was basically the Italian version of the filet mignon with Gorgonzola cheese and a mushroom sauce.  My husband ordered the veal Parmesan. We also ordered the seafood salad as an appetizer. The seafood was so good! It had a buttery and lemony flavor to it and pieces of onion and garlic to boot! Delectable! The veal and steak were very tender and flavorful. You could taste each ingredient on the plate. Also, their bread was truly oven baked...homemade....and they brought us a dish of olive oil with roasted peppers and capers with garlic and spices and herbs that just jumped out at us as soon as it got to the table!!!! When we dipped the bread in it it's as if we were transported to Southern Italy! Amazing! Definitely an experience! A ""Must Go""!!!! A very clean and family friendly establishment! Can't wait to come back with family and friends!"
Katelyn S.,/user_details?userid=DQi3ub1uF6jxbLzq6oQ6KQ,"Yonkers, NY",11/27/2017,4,We stopped by Little Italy for the first time a few weeks ago. I had the Gnocchi with melted mozzarella and it was beyond delicious. I also got their house sangria. It was good but for a mostly juice cocktail it was not worth $13.00. Overall we had a fantastic experience.

Every time I have someone in town, Da Gennaro is where I bring them to offer the best and most authentic little Italy experience. Last time, our waitress Vallery was super friendly and attentive."
C W.,/user_details?userid=cwo1Ay7n9JciM5GYtR9_ww,"Columbus, OH",10/3/2019,5,Lovely dinner at a quintessential Little Italy spot.

I feel that you can definitely tell a lot about an Italian place just based on bruschetta, so we ordered one. It was very, very mediocre. The entrees came out which were a pesto noodle dish, a simple tomato sauce penne dish, and a chicken parm dish. The chicken parm was the best dish by far, everything else was about as good as the Bruschetta. The service was really good, and everyone was friendly. The bread and oil was plentiful. It's about 20-30$ a plate. overall it was just alright."
Big D T.,/user_details?userid=yBWEmG-iFkfrAhONxUjeMg,"Fishkill, NY",7/7/2014,4,Lunch with the wife. It was excellent. I had the lasagna filled with delicious ricotta cheese and a savory meat sauce.   Wife had the lobster ravioli.   Try the bruschetta.

We were fully prepared for a subpar meal inside a tourist trip, but were pleasantly surprised by how good the food and service were at Da Gennaro! Immediately upon being seated, we were given fresh bread with a delicious olive oil and herb mixture. One of our friends ordered the ceasar salad to start, and although I didn't try it, it looked delicious. I had the pesto pizza which was AMAZING, by far one of the best pizzas i've ever had. My friend had the tortellini alla bolognese and it too was delicious. Even the sangria was great! Unlike most places, this wasn't spiked fruit juice. It was real sangria! If you're in Little Italy and looking for a good meal, don't hesitate to try Da Gennaro, you' won't regret it!"

Oktofani E.,/user_details?userid=AlN9Hw6nCjo5S-SnlkTWzA,"Toronto, Canada",8/2/2015,1,"Another over rated restaurant in tourist attraction area in NYC. I can't deny that the waitress are tentative and quick to respond but the kitchen staff seems having no idea with what they were doing. My scallop cocktail was tasteless, wasn't even impressions; while my clamp pasta was way too salty. The only thing, which was worth of money, was sangria."

Steve I.,/user_details?userid=63S2_NfP7EOi9bbqz8Pnug,"Pompton Plains, NJ",9/19/2016,4,"Ate outside during San Gennaro. Nice atmosphere. House Cab and Sangria were very good drinks.

Olivia L.,/user_details?userid=utmRaF_3KH6Dvj4L3NYj0w,"North Shore, Haleiwa, HI",6/18/2018,1,"Do not go here if you are vegan. And do not go here if you are in search of good service. Looking past the cheesy, for-show bravado of fake Italian authenticism, our server communicated very little and when he did, it was dismissive and rude. We inquired as to the ingredients in a few menu items. He did not answer us, and was very uninformed on the contents of his menu. This touristy and horribly impolite restaurant of little italy is not worth the price or the fake authentic italian food."

My card was over charged $25 which is really irritating. The restaurant is already pricey as is, and then they want to be sneaky and overcharge my card because they think I won't notice? That's unacceptable. I do not support a dishonest business. The young man with the glasses was our server, I didn't catch his name- but his service was good however the stealing is not acceptable to me. Be very aware of the amount you are charged if you are paying card. The food was not worth the dishonesty."

I'm 100% Italian and I am very picky over Italian places when eating out. I've been to quite a few places in Little Italy and Da Gennaro is the most authentic and has the best service you could want. When you go, ask for Clark to be your waiter, and he'll take care of you. One of the best in the city. Thank you Da Gennaro for being a special gem."

Dessert was good and coffee was fresh. Highly recommend.
Michael R.,/user_details?userid=3ciRMCOufYB9u9aDIhDXsQ,"Secaucus, NJ",6/18/2017,3,Ah! It's alright. Kind of small. Food is okay but nothing to rave over. Will probably not come back.
Joyce D.,/user_details?userid=nK1ngGUg2Hjoo2N6i-X__Q,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",6/14/2017,1,Very very disappointed. The cocktail shrimp was $16 but there were only five shrimps. I'm pretty sure they just assumed we are tourists who can't speak English so they offered us this pure ripoff.
Chelsey S.,/user_details?userid=QULAvXUm3tRSevSLmSt9Cg,"Scottsdale, AZ",11/12/2016,5,Food was good. We will be back again. Not a 5 star restaurant but if your area and hungry. Stop by for some decent Italian food. I had the lasagna and my mom ordered chicken fettuccine. Lasagna good but that fettuccine  she had was probably the best I've tried.

Yekaterina J.,/user_details?userid=cyO_PiHqtvNQlbWdIfRhig,"New York, NY",10/10/2017,1,"My husband and I ordered a Margherita pizza, when it came I took a bite of the crust before noticing that there was a large black hair in the cheese on the pizza. Neither I nor my husband have black hair. I waved the waiter over and pointed out the hair to him and asked him to get us another pizza, and that we didn't mind waiting for a new one to be made. 20 minutes later the waiter returned and put a new pizza in front of us. However, it wasn't new, because the same exact chunk of crust that I had bit off the first pie was missing from this one. So, either the new pizza happened to have the same chunk of crust missing as the chunk I had bit off the first pie or, more likely, they thought they could just remove the hair and serve us the same pizza without us noticing. Absolutely disgusting, you need to be seriously cheap to try and re-serve a hairy pizza to a paying customer!!"

The house Mae Olive oil was amazing..!! We ordered the chicken Alfredo and tortellini in meat sauce. Both pastas were tender/al dente. The Alfredo sauce was rich and tasted like the best butter I ever had. Chicken was juicy and well seasoned. My meat sauce was hearty and delicious. No room for dessert but I will definitely be back

Marisol A.,/user_details?userid=KGYH8hgGQRJsbSkufKn71g,"Brooklyn, NY",9/24/2017,2,Went to this restaurant today and wasn't very impressed. I asked for garlic bread never received it and when I asked for it again I was given regular bread. When I was given the bill i noticed that I was charged for 2 sodas. When I asked the waiter about being charged for the 2nd soda he told me that they don't offer free refills?!! Who charges for 2nd refill on sodas these days? And if that was the case then why didn't he state that when the request was made?! 1st and last time!

Samantha C.,/user_details?userid=pF0bPcs6aSQxAtV3HjX87w,"Nutley, NJ",12/30/2017,4,"The food was really good ! i can't give it five stars because a soup was advertised as a special without a price and our waitress did not tell us it was a HUGE zuppa de pesce minus the pasta . should advertise or at least tell people how big the soup is because we barely could finish our actual orders. our actual meal also came while still having the soup and the waiter said he'd be back in 10 aka finish the food, almost pushing us out. i'm only giving this four stars because i blame the waitress for pushing us out and assuring herself a big tip (soup cost us $60 extra for two) or i'd give it five stars."

Sarah R.,/user_details?userid=nRjl7d1ynuaWlpPYVEWsnw,"Manhattan, NY",5/16/2016,5,Food was great and Shaban was a great waiter. This is our favorite place in little Italy and we will definitely come back! We recommend the profiteroles if you save room for dessert!
Bek K.,/user_details?userid=nNnKoIlabHaCZW2ELKfoIg,"New York, NY",12/18/2016,4,"We have been here on Sun evening, place was very busy. Waiters are very nice to customers. Food is very tasty (everything we ordered). Nice atmosphere and interior. Price for 2 appetizers, pasta and Italian crapes & 3 glasses of wine is $120 - witch is a bit pricy for the area... you can get the same much cheaper anywhere else. in general 5*-1* for the price."
Crystal C.,/user_details?userid=tVD8tJhPslNgi4-7m6Oy5w,"Dallas, TX",3/13/2019,5,"This place was so good, we had the Alfredo, pizza and spaghetti bolognese. Valerie the waitress was awesome! With so many restaurants to choose from in this area we're so glad we picked this place. It's def on our list to eat at the next time we visit NY."

The first time I went I customized my order to something that was not on the menu and our server was more than accommodating. It was amazing! On my last visit the service was just ok, but the food was still amazing! One more great visit and I may change the rating to 5 stars!! Try the Homemade Gnocchi!!"
Saul S.,/user_details?userid=ZtruYplDQHNv4yYTiOYRMA,"Carson City, NV",12/8/2018,5,"There are many good Italian restaurants on Mulberry Street in Little Italy. We have checked out several. Earlier this month we had dinner at Da Gennaro. I pride myself in being somewhat of a connoisseur when it comes to Italian food as well as restaurant service and atmosphere. I must say without a doubt, Da Gennaro is the best Italian dinner my wife and I have ever experienced. The menu selection is extraordinary, as are the sauces, appetizers and entrees. We went back again for lunch and experienced the same ambiance and food quality. Everything was prepared perfectly, and staff and managers checked on our satisfaction throughout and after dinner. Hint: My wife is a sangria fan--and they offered house made white, rose or red at dinner. The sangria is excellent too. (If you want seating in a quiet atmosphere, ask for a table in one of the back rooms.)"
Lariss S.,/user_details?userid=ce_w4fxa8OqB0qQ9PN22_w,"Lone Tree, CO",5/21/2019,5,"First time in Little Italy and couldn't have been better! The food, service and atmosphere at Da Gennaro was above and beyond. The servers and the manager, Jason, were very welcoming and knowledgeable with the menu. It was my mom's first time in New York City and the manager treated her with a free dessert, which made her feel very special. I would highly recommend Da Gennaro if you are looking for excellent food, a warm atmosphere and excellent service!"
Jessica J.,/user_details?userid=SXSB8rAU9XQgYXP-HO2g8A,"Clover, SC",7/5/2017,5,"Great service and food. Loved the environment, definitely what we were looking to experience in Little Italy."

Athena Z.,/user_details?userid=BOQETrCOjYQPxTBdmK8G1Q,"San Jose, CA",2/18/2019,1,"We chose this place simply based on its location. The place is composed of two sections, but, expect to be crammed near the corner one as other remains empty. The bathrooms had no soap, toilet paper, or paper towels, which was a bummer after riding the subways. A lady, which appeared to be the owner paced back and fort dehumanizing her employees for petty issues. The food was GREAT, but the simple fact that the owner had no shame in treating her employees in foul manners made the experience beyond unpleasant. We found a hair in our food, but we couldn't bare the courage to complain because we feared for the employees."
Kathy J.,/user_details?userid=edX6AU-6QtzUvvhpXQDLWQ,"Montgomery, NY",6/30/2017,4,"My husband and I stopped by around 6pm on a Friday evening. Seats were starting to fill up on the sidewalk so we grabbed one quick! We enjoyed wine/beer and delicious bread with amazing dipping oil while we waited for our food. We weren't very hungry so my husband order calamari and I had a mushroom pasta dish. Both were  fantastic. The pasta was homemade and the sauce was incredible-I could have licked my plate! Excellent value, service, and food.  We'll be back!"

Kristine L.,/user_details?userid=7C3uweVovobiiGve29mBjQ,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",11/13/2018,5,Extraordinarily delicious. Excellent ambiance. Exceptional service. We ordered the alfredo and bruschetta. So satisfying in every bite. I've never been waited with such attention. Definitely eat here if you want to be spoiled by all the waiters. The owner came personally check on us to make sure we were satisfied. I really enjoyed the special attention we got with our delectable meal. I will come back when I visit Little Italy again!
Robert T.,/user_details?userid=VqK0_2k9AIF3YZkl7Oqy4Q,"Miami, FL",11/10/2018,5,"What an excellent meal at a NYC classic. Chicken Francais, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken sorrentina, pasta e fagiolo soup, all delicious. Service is wonderful and Anthony is a charm. Bravissimo!"
Peter K.,/user_details?userid=BDjiEmXljD2ZHT61Iv9rrQ,"New York, NY",12/30/2015,5,"Awesome legendary Italian restaurant in the heart of Little Italy. This place is the site of the original Umbertos Clam House where the mobster Joe Gallo was shot. They showed us which table it was. The food here is awesome! The red sauce is great, the pasta is perfectly al dente. The seafood is fantastic. One of my favorite places in Little Italy."
Haylee M.,/user_details?userid=mj70ruTS15gpD0AWwONEZg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/29/2019,5,My mom & I came here for lunch and it was absolutely amazing. The service was impeccable.

We will be back(:
Patra C.,/user_details?userid=usNpbgDnmN7Fz7TphWVCYA,"Queens, NY",12/17/2015,4,"My friend and I happened to be in the neighborhood; with a little convincing (he's been here before), I gave in and decided to have dinner here. I've always been skeptical about eating in this area, but Da Gennero had proved me wrong. I went with the Mango Mojito for the drink, personally it tasted weird and I wouldn't recommend it. Although food (I ordered the Risotto) was decent and staff were friendly. I love the ambiance and the fact that we weren't rushed at all."

Timy M.,/user_details?userid=bfyMnTteWfN46wBxe_rQJA,"New York, NY",6/1/2015,5,"This place is our regular stop in Little Italy. We were here last night again, they started the service with the warm bread and a homemade olive oil dip with fresh herbs. I ordered salmon for my main dish which was excellent my wife ordered chicken special which was out of this world. Service was excellent and friendly . We always like the decoration, in summer there are fresh baskets of flowers on the side walk which makes this place stand out even more."

Navya T.,/user_details?userid=XjhjZ-gkSzRTfa5vtKf1Og,"Frisco, TX",1/4/2019,1,"An overpriced restaurant for entirely subpar food and even more disappointing service. After arriving at Da Gennaro, our waiter took ten minutes to acknowledge us and we were never even given the bread basket, which is customary. This lack of attention continued as we did not see our waiter for the rest of the visit and were having to ask random waiters for help. After finally receiving our food, it was not the level of food which was needed to make up for the horrible service. After eating, we continued to wait another fifteen minutes until we waved down a manager to ask for the check- which was insanely overpriced. The entire restaurant was overwhelming with negligence and lack of communication. Wether it was a problem with management or other employees, the restaurant is a trap for visitors and a complete waste of a time and money."
Paul R.,/user_details?userid=1-9n89mzK6F37iqqtsbmMg,"Great Falls, VA",12/30/2016,5,"Others have said it:  Classic old-school Italian-American cooking in a classic Italian atmosphere.  Crowed?  Yes, but not noisy because everyone was EATING!  Simple things are the hardest things to fake.  Da Gennaro puts out an outstanding marinara -- perfectly balanced acidity, slightly tart, not sweet.  Meatballs that are so smoothly textured that you can carve them with a spoon (which I did).  Condoteri such as oil & garlic sautéed spinach or broccoli leaves and stalks.   Just fantastic.  I wanted to get something for afterward but we decided to go a block south and get the cannoli from a wonderful bakery that was still open (we could see it from the restaurant window).   Do yourself a favor and try this place; you will not regret it."
Jessica G.,/user_details?userid=2lL9daOK7pH52VHr02FPhg,"Miami, FL",12/30/2018,5,Great in every aspect! We were a party of 9 and all the staff was very friendly and professional. Service was quick. All the plates were very tasty and you can tell they were freshly made with good ingredients.
Amy Jo W.,/user_details?userid=RZTAhRj_oDD6Urcs6TO6qQ,"Ball Ground, GA",10/14/2013,5,"It was our first time here at this incredible establishment, however it won't be our last. We received top notch service from beginning to end starting with the host Massimo, our waiter Vito and Manager Giuseppe! Everyone was so professional, attentive and made our experience so pleasurable! The candle light atmosphere was romantic and the food from dinner to dessert was impeccable! Hands down the best restaurant in Little Italy! We always have very high expectations and highly recommend this place. Second to none."
Ivan C.,/user_details?userid=I7tFdvuxoviVcy3WRercAA,"Doral, FL",12/27/2018,1,"Absolutely the worts italian restaurant or restaurant of any kind that I have ever been in my life. Terrible experience starting from the service (Manuel was not attentive and just trying to flip a table) to the food was mediocre. I understand is expected if your business model is to run a turist trap in NYC, but decency should never be forgotten."
Emily C.,/user_details?userid=ypx3ji1lwuid5H2k6ieeMQ,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",12/26/2018,5,Our favorite place for lunch when visiting the city. We come here every year. Service and food are excellent. Andrew was especially helpful.

The decorations for the holiday were lovely, the wait staff was terrific and the food was great! I didn't expect such a delicious meal in Little Italy anymore, but I was pleasantly surprised. The olive oil for the bread was spicy and flavorful, my friend's gnocchi looked amazing and my linguini alla vongole was one of the best I've ever had (and yes, my grandfather was raised in Italy and I've lived there too.) I really recommend it. Buon natale!"
Eric M.,/user_details?userid=rQDPFIZCkXy5AFGvMendpw,"Sun Lakes, AZ",12/17/2018,5,VERY good meal. Service was great and food was wonderful. Small restaurant that can get crowded but worth the effort.

The atmosphere, the service and the food were exactly what we were looking for.  We had the calamari, home made burrata and mussels to start.

Meme B.,/user_details?userid=nDz9yR9IsPa7YpKeqJXRaQ,"Elk Grove, CA",1/19/2016,2,It was good. This place is always packed especially in the summer with the out door seating. It has the feel of fine dining but they use paper napkins except cloth. Minestrone soup was great cause it was snowing great flavor. The Caesar salad was ok nothing special.

All of the meals were sooo good! The only thing I didn't like was the bread they served before the meal, it was too hard. The other thing I didn't like was that they would not split the bill. Other than that it was a great experience!"

During nice weather, it is wonderful to sit in the outdoor cafe and people watch while having any of their excellent offerings. A personal favorite is the Fettucine Alfredo with grilled chicken. With al of the competition in this area, Da Gennaro is always a sure thing."
Loryn A.,/user_details?userid=vOnjboQSruwAAcLW8zeqqw,"South Orange, NJ",11/18/2018,5,I come here with my grandson every Sunday night. They are so attentive and fast and truly caring about his food needs. (Gluten free) the food is delicious consistently and the portions are very satisfying. Everyone is so kind and friendly. I love it here and will continue to keep coming back! Thank you to all of you wonderful people!
Michael S.,/user_details?userid=O5lfO7vAAXb7Cdso7DlDKw,"San Antonio, TX",11/17/2018,5,Good food. Service was friendly and prompt.  Elvis was our server and he was outstanding. Front room was lively. We ate in the back room which was calmer but still pleasant and bright.

Nicole L.,/user_details?userid=A_OETe5Xr26FTNRPkRQ4zw,"Washington, DC",6/15/2011,3,"We walked from Chelsea to Soho and somehow ended up in Little Italy. Though I visited New York many times, I had not seen Little Italy it was quite a sight especially with the road blocked off for the weekend. It was touristy but what the hell, it was fun. We checked out the menus at various restaurants and out of the blue we wanted a photo of us,  the nice gentleman at Da Gennaro took it for us. We walked around more but decided to go back. The table we were seated at was right by the road so we had a good view of all the people walking past us. I was going to order a Sangiovese but the server recommended the chianti for a fuller bodied wine, I was very happy with his recommendation. We wanted a light snack as we were going to out later in the night, so we had a pizza and a veal parmigiana. Everything tasted good."

And most of them while friendly are pushy and in one case rude. Da Gennaro was the only place where the man outside was friendly and not pushy which made me want to eat there. And I am so glad we did, not only was everyone amazing the food was spectacular!"

Isabella S.,/user_details?userid=OYMC1X0OmRTvQkhK7M2WPQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/3/2015,4,"Being that my father is straight from Italy, my standards for Italian are HIGH if and when I do decide to go out and get Italian food. Me and a friend were walking through little Italy, not feeding into the tourist trap restaurants that have a handsome man waiting outside trying to hustle you into his restaurant. As we continued along Mulberry, we saw Da Gennaro and decided we really liked the way it looked. There was seating inside and outside, nice lighting and it looked really cute the way it was set up. We approached the menu and unlike most other places, we didn't feel pressured to eat here. I've generally been disappointed and unimpressed every time I've gone out to eat in little Italy. In my opinion, most of the food is average to below average. Da Gennaro changed that for me! We had very prompt service and our server was friendly, but not overly friendly in the creepy way that some of these servers can be. We were served bread with a generous amount of pretty awesome dipping oil. We started with the calamari which was so light and crisp. The calamari wasn't rubbery at all. Only complaint is that I wish they included the octopus, and not just the calamari rings. I ordered the stuffed shells and they were aaaamazing. My friend ordered one of their homemade pasta dishes (many of the pastas are home made), which was so tasty. We were pleasantly full and pleasantly surprised. Their dinnerware appears to be a little out dated, and the table is set up with paper napkins which are not my favorite, but all we had to do was ask for a cloth napkin and our server brought one quickly. Most entrees are between 15-30 dollars. We ordered two entrees, an app and a bottle of prosecco and our bill was just under 100 dollars, which wasn't too bad. I will be returning for sure."

I however ordered a simple Fettuccine alfredo, it was very bland, no flavor whatsoever, it tasted like the  fettuccine was just tossed in cream with no parm. I did not complain i just asked for extra parm and pepper to try and give it same flavor. My waiter noticed I did not like my food and insisted to make it up to me. He got the manager for us and they insisted to take it off the check and offered another meal instead i opted for coffee and desert (no charge)The staff was excellent this is why I'm giving 4 stars, and because my fiancé loved his gnocchi."

Daniel J.,/user_details?userid=tb2bIs2z91iJXa3poXApLg,"Old Lyme, CT",8/25/2018,3,"The location and the atmosphere were great. Dinner in little Italy, what's not to like? The food was adequate, yet not impressive by any measure. Meatballs were alright, but possibly frozen based on slightly rubbery texture. Same goes for the ravioli. The stuffed mushrooms were also liking in flavor and well, stuffing. The pizza was inferior to pretty much any pizza I've ever had in NY. The house Pinot noir was pretty cheap tasting, but cost $12 a glass. That's just ridiculous. The service was good. The bathrooms were gross. All in all, this place was extremely overpriced, and the food was under portioned and not much better than neighborhood joints where I live in CT. Maybe worse."
Er C.,/user_details?userid=NUkKJN61Fy1fOkPPqHLcjg,"Tacoma, WA",8/15/2018,5,Visiting New York this week. Lots of great choices in Little Italy but we decided to choose this restaurant and we were happy that we did. I had the Caprice and the Cannelloni. Both were amazing. The artisan bread with their dip was also very good.  Service was great and the open air atmosphere brought an old school Italian feel to our dinner. We really enjoyed it.
Mike S.,/user_details?userid=lRaiclQyA4chyZ-xqOzing,"Perryville, MD",1/3/2018,5,My wife and I needed an evening out after spending a week with family roaming around NYC. I suggested little Italy and Da Gennaro was the place she chose. Friendly and helpful staff. Menu is not crowded with unneeded dishes. The pasta Alfredo was very good even for one with a cream sauce. I had the pasta with chicken and mushrooms. The portions are ample for all as we now have dinner for the next day. My wife ordered a lemon ice served in the whole skin of a lemon which was full of lemon ice not just halfway filled. Though small and with tables close I was still able to converse with my wife. If you are looking for a lunch or relaxed dinner try here.
Jaime B.,/user_details?userid=mxDPJd9I_DwxgdXi-VaHjg,"Washington, DC",1/1/2016,3,"We had, the ""mozzarella in carrozza"", expecting melted cheese in pot with olive oil, but the dish was mainly a cheese sandwich fried with tomato sauce on the side, (the sauce was really good, while the cheese was average), for main courses we shared the  asparagus rissotto, very tasty and well cooked, soft and it was a large quantity, the lobster ravioli was spectacular, it came with half lobster and four cheese raviloni, i missed a little more flavor on the sauce but it was very tasty. The negative point was on the coffee, where we order double espresso understanding that being an Italian restaurant would grant a good coffee brew, what they came up with, was more like a espresso shot with added water... The price was acceptable for the whole set was under $100 but without wine. I would recommend the place but not expect the best Italian food ever though good in average."
Shana M.,/user_details?userid=JR2AaSA0dtZE1AqHxDxd-A,"Cheltenham, PA",8/8/2016,5,This was the best authentic Italian food my family and I went here and we've never tasted Italian food like this it's like every taste is a savor in your mouth and our waiter Angel was very nice!

Anyone salt sensitive with high blood pressure do NOT go to this place. The only thing I was pleased with were the appetizer calamari rings. Don't know why I took the rest to go because I threw it away just outside the door. A bad way to spend 100.00 for lunch. If there was -star rating, this place would qualify."

Then for main course we had a carbonara and Italian sausage and peppers. You won't leave here hungry and washed down with a couple of peroni it cost around $90. Well recommended."

Chandler C.,/user_details?userid=p7QWT3wC1N6ghavhZJyeYQ,"Roanoke, VA",1/11/2018,5,"My husband and I live in Virginia. When I tell you that we based our recent New York trip around this restaurant alone, I am not kidding. I would eat here every day if I could. The alfredo sauce is the creamiest and richest I have ever eaten. The lasagna is phenomenal, and don't even get me started on their olive oil they bring out with their bread for starters (if not for flying back home, I would have ordered bottles to take back with us!!). This is by far the best Italian meal that I have ever eaten. Go with friends or family that you don't mind sharing plates with. My husband, my in-laws and I all got a different pasta dish, and we took turns passing it around the table so we could get a little taste of everything that this restaurant had to offer. The portions are decently sized; make sure you come hungry. The staff is also extremely pleasant and made our dining experience run smoothly. I contacted the manager a couple months ago (while in VA) for a gift card for my Father-in-law for his birthday and she was so helpful and accommodating. She sent it to me immediately. I would most certainly recommend Da Gennaro if you are ever in Little Italy!! I wish they were closer to us at home!!"

Kelly P.,/user_details?userid=q8OdcTdl_VEsw-zL8Vwrqw,"El Paso, TX",1/23/2011,5,"So, we kinda got sucked in here by some smooth-talking Italiano whose job is to flirt with tourists and get them in, but, hey, we were hungry, and the lunch specials were still going on (even though that was a lie, but we got to order off that menu because that was what got us in there). The place is pretty cute, although it almost feels like there's more waitors than tables, but all the workers were very friendly. I got the spinach raviolis and my friend had the pesto pizza. Pizza was good, raviolis were AWESOME. I'd go back for them (before 4pm, that is)."

I had the special mango strawberry salad which had the perfect balsamic vinaigrette and homemade farfalle with a delicate pesto sauce, shrimp and bay scallops. I easily could have finished my generous portion because it was so deliciously satisfying. If I am in Little Italy this will be my top choice."
Rise D.,/user_details?userid=-y_IDVU2_v0ym0QMX3E6cg,"Honolulu, HI",10/21/2012,4,I'm glad I got to try this restaurant in Little Italy.  I was walking around looking for a place to sit down because I was walking around all day and happened to pass by this restaurant.  The wait staff was so friendly and attentive.  The bread and garlic olive oil was delicious.  I ordered the risotto and it was really good.  The portions were pretty big and the food came out quickly.  I recommend going here if you are ever in the area. Prices were decent too.
Natalie R.,/user_details?userid=Lgv0wIH6GYH3gBevwZiKMA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/18/2015,2,Tourist trap. Good service. Shit food. Pasta was over cooked and NOT fresh. Canned beets in the salad. Pizza under cooked. Sangria tastes like they added flat soda. Very disappointing. AVOID!
Laura N.,/user_details?userid=7YTx3w2vO45LVW04fr08Pw,"Brooklyn, NY",9/9/2015,2,"Place seemed like a good choice, with plenty of dining al fresco, but was a disappointment. Food is mediocre at best. Not authentic or gourmet. Veal was tough; Margherita pie wasn't traditional--sloppy cheese, no pieces of mozzarella or basil (looked and tasted like a regular slice from any pizzeria). First time a waiter ever cleared my table and asked ""food no good?"" Food doesn't warrant the prices. Avoid this tourist trap."
Peter K.,/user_details?userid=nPPRV6xhMKuXDdVVoTfHbQ,"Saco, ME",9/9/2015,5,The food was amazing! The service was even better!  I had the chicken parmigiania and wow was it perfect!  I have eaten at many restaurants and I would go back here in a heartbeat! Thanks for the great experience
Kincaid W.,/user_details?userid=YLgZx7WqfiF4elLWL93Jqw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/22/2018,5,This is my favorite restaurant in New York. The service is amazing and the food was excellent. The fra diavlo sauce is my favorite (note it is a little spicy). Would recommend for a night or or just a casual dinner.
David P.,/user_details?userid=pu8PBVIw2whqwe57M8SiRw,"Pembroke, MA",5/11/2015,3,"We keep finding ourselves going back here. The staff is very friendly and the food is consistently good. The wine is good and moderately priced. There are other good restaurants in NYC and Little Italy, but this is a great stand by. P.S. Get the artichoke appetizer and save some bread for it."
Mark M.,/user_details?userid=ZXfX5DrIiu8xOupFdHXp5w,"New York, NY",5/11/2015,3,"Da Gennaro.....I had plently of great Italian food, from my Italian friends grandma cooking to real Italian eateries. Although, I was hoping the taste to be a bit more authentic from the Caprese Salad to the Stuffed Peppers to the Ravioli. The experience was great since it's outside and service is good as always."

It sits on the corner of Mulberry and Hester, which let's in a lot of light and you can people watch from inside. Basic menu items include antipasti, pasta, carne, peace. Everyone just RAVES about the olive oil mix (which already includes parmesan for us westerners) plus the warm white bread they start you with. It's got all of the inner workings of tourist restaurant that you would find near the Piazza Venezia in Rome., big menu, small wine glasses, hearty portions, and lots of people that the waitstaff can usually handle except on a busy sunlit afternoon outside -- at least the servers will sympathize and can be honest."

There are a lot of good choices of Italian restaurants in Little Italy and this one was well worth it. The food was fresh and delicious, the staff was quick, friendly and courteous, and we left full and happy. David was so friendly and welcoming, we felt right at home. The manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our meal and we let him know this was a special experience. Highly recommended!  For a couple of out of towers, this was exactly what we were looking for. We will be back."

Gregory P.,/user_details?userid=frLZ5wQa3aD4IrZAkDlOVQ,"Ocala, FL",6/12/2016,5,My first review! My husband and I came to little Italy and enjoyed every minute! We brought in by a nice Italian man who recommend the food and it was delicious!  Our waitress gave us suggestions  and we let her pick our meals herself.  She did great! I had homemade papardelley pasta with mushrooms in a creamy pink sauce and our waitress picked the spaghetti and meatballs for my husband.  He ate the whole thing. The brushetta was good. Portion was a little small but we enjoyed. She suggested we have the profiterales ~~more homemade items from the menu.  The wine was Italian. The atmosphere was very nice.  We sat by the window.  The staff was amazing and my waitress was attentive and friendly.  Enjoyed it a lot.
Abel F.,/user_details?userid=Xx5MuI5G1IrRIGSTKfW8Cw,"San Antonio, TX",7/27/2015,5,Delicious restaurant! ! Service was impeccable! ! I would  recommend to anyone  coming to little Italy on vacation.

Vivi B.,/user_details?userid=MARY1ynnZOvE2TML4VNi4g,"Bloomfield, NJ",7/25/2015,1,"The food was okay! Not homemade. But the server was the worst of all, arrogant, never came to the table after he took the order, or acknowledge us for anything."
Maureen P.,/user_details?userid=w7xOe64if4-8bHOWSjuO2A,"Waterloo, IA",2/23/2018,5,"This is my favorite restaurant in Little Italy!  The food is great and Alex is my favorite waiter. I have been bringing guests from out of town here for over 10 years because of his attentive service.  He always remembers the finer details of how we like our wine and entrees. They use fresh ingredients and have a broad classic Italian menu. The bread, wine and salad are always a great start when you are really hungry. The thrown open front windows and walls (during the pleasant months) pull you in from the street or invite you to dine outside. When these have to closed for the winter... the classic holiday garland is beautiful too. They are all a friendly staff with attentive service and fresh Italian  food. Alex is probably the senior waiter of the bunch and definitely our favorite!"
Ryan S.,/user_details?userid=ALBRf8EtIRDhAnUI96GPyA,"Mulberry, FL",2/13/2016,5,Had a amazing experience at this small Italian restaurant.  Food was delicious and the service was amazing!  Being from FL I would come back here before trying anywhere else for the first time.

Sarah M.,/user_details?userid=ct7E4e73DqMVrmEYGDD9Bw,"Alexandria, VA",6/29/2015,4,"Wasn't expecting too much from a restaurant in little Italy as I heard it has become super touristy, but De Gennaro really surprised us! Wonderful food, very flavorful and authentic. Service was also fantastic. What really made our visit memorable though was David, our greeter and host. Friendly, attentive, and a great talker, he made our night! The cherry on top was when my mother and I asked him whether it was safe to walk back to the metro as it was past midnight...he told us it was, but just to be sure, he walked us there himself! A true gentleman and the star of the show. Your Jordanian sisters appreciate your hospitality :)"
Proma C.,/user_details?userid=XLM--sKndsXjyST9ChduGA,"Portland, OR",6/25/2015,3,Good food! Quantity is not...so if you are hungry this is not the place. I had the spinach ravioli...good! Husband had the spicy marinara over penne..that was true to its name..spice yet tasty. The road side seating is nice as you get the feel of the city as you munch. Great for a one time experience.
Danielle S.,/user_details?userid=n_drVb0XBqDvkYU1vb-p1Q,"Brooklyn, NY",9/4/2016,1,"Severed ties with my favorite little Italy restaurant today. Worst service ever and management didn't try to make it right at all!! I usually am an advocate of a tip no matter what but not today! Attitudes were disgusting!  We ordered chicken Francese with Penne and were brought out linguine (which I hate). We told the waiter and then he brought out just some dry penne, no Francese sauce. Then the manager ""did all she could"" by telling a busboy to take the plate and put some fresh penne on it. He comes back with just penne and linguine, no chicken! We couldn't believe it. The manager then brings us a cannoli like that is supposed to fix our now cold and unwanted dinner. So then the bill comes because we're just ready to go and we get charged for everything. So I say are you planning to take anything off and the waiter says the manager says no. Just bad service all around. I don't mind paying for what I asked for but if you give me the wrong item 3 times then it should be discounted or even free."

Wasn't blocking the door or disturbing their business in any way. Was approached by  a really large man named Dave, a manager, who physically tried to move me without even asking. I complied without question. He is a bully and kept threatening me by putting his hand on my shoulder even after I moved. I asked him not to touch me, and he got in my face. I asked him why he was bothering me, and he said, ""You're bothering me! Now I'm gonna stand here and bother you."" I was literally just standing there not saying a word. He went on about how he had been in the military, etc... I guess that was supposed to intimidate me. He was belligerent and really cruel to the woman standing next to me. She also wasn't doing anything but standing there. There are ways to handle these things, and he dealt with it very poorly."

Conner L.,/user_details?userid=LtxmVivSYexZTzpy-sEW4g,"Acworth, GA",8/9/2017,5,I was in Little Italy and there was a lot of restaurants and I chose this one.

The shrimp pasta i ordered was great and the portabello mushroom... just a great experience!!!!! I also really enjoyed the seating outside, perfect experience."
Yaz R.,/user_details?userid=zgMAfVCGp3DtJHCq57GMyw,"Bronx, NY",4/29/2017,4,"Got married yesterday at the nearby Marriage Bureau and had reservations at Da Gennaro. The process to make reservations was painfree (we made reservations two weeks ago in person) plus they called AND texted to confirm my party of 12 (with 3 kids) was coming the day of. The drinks were good (cheaper than I expected tbh), the appetizers were yummy (the calamari was perfectly fried and the bruschetta was to die for), and all of our entrees were really, really good (we all had different ones ranging from: chicken parmesan, shrimp parmesan, fettuccine alfredo with chicken, etc). We had initially wanted the small private-ish room to the side of the restaurant but our waitress Eva suggested IN the restaurant as ventilation was better. Thank god we did, all of the open windows really helped, as 4/28 was the first real spring day we've had. It was overall a great lunch!"
Samarah A.,/user_details?userid=d9rfi8YJJL2hnlLpPzRCzA,"Manhattan, NY",11/27/2015,5,"Where to start?! We started with chefs special seafood soup. It was beyond amazing!

Firoozeh B.,/user_details?userid=0Rwh5AGwvI6ZfK-qQagpXg,"Redwood City, CA",4/16/2017,5,Came upon this great spot as we were walking through Little Italy! The greeter was funny and made me and my friend want to come and enjoy their Sangria. Started with the fagiole soup and it was to die for. It was a cool day yesterday and we sat on the patio so this was a perfect starter for us. Our waiter was on top of it and explained everything to us.. ended up splitting a pasta and the osso bucco and we were in heaven. Comfort food at its best. The Sangria was tasty and we stayed way too long on the gorgeous patio people watching. Ill be back for sure when Im back in the area.

Robert L.,/user_details?userid=Xqg18kzSy-4d_svrNTwOnw,"Medford, NY",11/15/2014,4,We started off our dinner with bread which was served with olive oil. The oil/herb combination was very good tasting.

Our waiter (sadly I don't remember his name) was hilarious and friendly and just made our dinning experience over the top. We actually ran into him the next day and he remembered us and embraced us in hugs. Seriously my favorite dinning experience in my week long trip in NY. Will definitely be coming back whenever I find myself in NY again."
Rob F.,/user_details?userid=UbVw1L0EaxmmMJiDQsaBAQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/19/2017,4,Went for lunch on a weekday.  The chicken with tomato-cream sauce is excellent. The gnocchi was good.  And overall the service was quite good.  Would definitely recommend if you are eating in little Italy.
Tom A.,/user_details?userid=v5T9ga2fbREiFf8ONZh-DQ,"St. John's, Canada",5/27/2014,5,"We stopped here for lunch while sight seeing, and it was everything we expected and more. The meal was amazing and the service was prompt and pleasant. Would definitely come back."
Brittany L.,/user_details?userid=kyO3fBzkbOsnFSJq7i997Q,"Civic Center, Manhattan, NY",12/6/2014,2,"Good place for tourist who don't know italian food. The furthest thing from ""fresh"" pizza or anything for that matter. Atleast the vibe is nice"
Stacey O.,/user_details?userid=-RsFYcZz0HeSrAhu5xDWBg,"Northside, Houston, TX",7/9/2017,5,"My family and I really ENJOYED the ambience , food and waiter, Javier.  We went to the restaurant twice during our 5 days stay in New York WOW.....We will return on our next visit to New York."
Mireille N.,/user_details?userid=LxbRiZW9P6p9ia8GmVzupg,"New York, NY",10/1/2016,3,It's a nice restaurant but the sangria is like water! And when the manager asked us how we like it we told her that it's not good but she told us you can get wine if you want to...
Nathan V.,/user_details?userid=Bg_4UoI1-I-zXWAfbGWmCQ,"Savannah, GA",11/29/2014,5,"We were walking down Mulberry St in Little Italy New York trying to choose a place to eat. We passed several places that looked good, but the pushy guys in front turned us away. We then came to Da Gennero, the man up front was very polite and did not try and push us in the door. George our server did a great job, never letting our drinks run dry. The food was fantastic and well worth the price. I recommend this place to anyone in looking for good food in Little Italy."
Kristen S.,/user_details?userid=bKdPNgHYvi46Jr-vE9kdnQ,"Fairfax Station, VA",11/14/2014,5,This is one of my favorite stops when visiting NY. I could dine on just the bread and amazing dipping oil alone. I always try one of the specials and their seafood is always my first choice. Enjoy!
Zachary S.,/user_details?userid=hXIMBZdA2SBfmqdpYYjvTw,"Cypress, CA",6/20/2017,5,This place is amazing from top to bottom from the food to the service. Everything says 5 stars it's family owned and when you come here you are part of the family. Ask for Manuel he is a host but will tell you the truth what is best and what to pass on. If you come to New York or you live here this place is a must.
Lindsey C.,/user_details?userid=jaFprKlxFKHQq2B7qStmdA,"New York, NY",12/24/2013,5,Very good italian food. The set up is very nice and quaint. Lovely family place or for a Friday night date. The tables are a little close together but the server accommodates  you nicely. Amazing desert!
Sunny J.,/user_details?userid=PV8woV6wefdA2BX46C2ITA,"Stockton, CA",5/29/2017,5,Was my first time here. Food was delicious. Beautiful location. Entire staff was very friendly.

Emaline T.,/user_details?userid=Zyu0yMp5-55UwnUI4kg3Eg,"New York, NY",4/3/2014,4,"New boyfriend brought me here on our first official date. It was a lovely spring evening but too chilly to eat outside. It was pretty packed when we arrived but thinned out by the end of our meal. We had great wine, great service and my pasta dish was delicious. The ambiance was really great, too. They had live music and the lighting was very romantic and soft. Definitely would return again."
Rachel B.,/user_details?userid=9HpgXpNG7qYbknGK_AWziQ,"St. John, IN",5/27/2017,5,One of the best Italian places I've been!!!  Request Gigi....He is great and very informative.  Loved every part of my experience.
Angelica A.,/user_details?userid=9R7jbu12U5nHE68wMnPcKQ,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",8/23/2017,4,"Great service. Made reservations prior to visit and was seated immediately.  Food was amazing. So authentic. Loved the gnocchi al pesto, it that was so filling that I got full only 1/2 way through the meal. Loved the ambiance. Surprisingly a very tranquil restaurant despite being on a very busy street. Well worth the money."
Gary J.,/user_details?userid=uRzyFK73ikhVMCYjk7w6QQ,"Philadelphia, PA",5/7/2017,5,"Excellent, attentive, and very polite service. Very good food. I really enjoyed the seafood risotto. The salads for sharing are also excellent."

We paid $80 for one of the poorer Italian meals we have had in a long time. It was funny because albeit expensive, this was still one of the cheaper restaurants on Mulberry. Lesson learned: don't go to a tourist spot and expect high quality."
Picky J.,/user_details?userid=cBE5hRJ_LQkin7NRwaYWYA,"Aliso Viejo, CA",4/15/2019,5,wow this is one of the best italian food i've had!!!  spaghetti bolognese was great!! their home made Meat sauce! and linguini alla vongole is my favorite and this place was the best i've had!!

Holly M.,/user_details?userid=D_6vdWIcdVfOCZGP6I8XVg,"Queens, NY",8/2/2016,1,"Been here twice. First time I didn't remember what I ate. Wasn't memorable. Had planned never to come back again. But ended up coming here because some friends were visiting and it was the first place we found without having to wait. I didn't want to be the kill joy. Got the calamari, because I thought I was being safe. Now that I look back on it, probably wasn't the best idea. Has anyone ever had fried rubber bands? I did. Cause that's what that calamari tasted like. Rubbery, no salt...flavorless basically. My friend got the lobster ravioli. She said it tasted like she bought frozen ravioli from Walmart. (Sorry Walmart) I agreed with her. Their food isn't fresh, and you can taste it. And they're kinda pricey for what they're offering. (Bland tasteless food) Lesson learned. Keep on walking if I ever think about coming here again."
A S.,/user_details?userid=5WiCpKBGhyN_tx9KuqtvoA,"Lincolnshire, IL",7/21/2014,4,"Visited with family of 4. Tasty food and great atmosphere, nice attentive service. Only complaint is the very strong A/c blowing in our face making our food a bit cold. It was summer tho so I get it."
Bill M.,/user_details?userid=Jcx0cjuiYHZMNpKjQXTLhw,"Bethesda, MD",5/18/2014,3,"Traditional Little Italy eatery on Mulberry Street. Went there on a nice spring Saturday night. Busy, but we were seated immediately at 9pm. Food was ok, but heavily salted. Service was efficient and waiter was attentive.  4 salads, 4 entrees and 3 glasses of wine. Bill came to $149, excluding tip."
Amy S.,/user_details?userid=NbSOAwBZvdd5kCa1XHCMBA,"Uxbridge, MA",2/18/2015,4,"Went for Valentine's day, had no reservation but was seated right away. Small place so seating is tight. The server was nice enough to let us move over once a window seat became available. The food was delicious. Sangria was even better. The servers were very attentive and great! Highly recommend this place for their food and service!"
Hernan P.,/user_details?userid=L2hfvO5JVGqEo9UHov7YEg,"Montclair, NJ",7/6/2013,3,"Good food at a reasonable price. Not giving 5 stars because the service was terrible, it took about 15 before we got somebody to take our drink orders. Also, they automatically add 17% for gratuity to the final bill, which is not deserved with the poor service provided"
Jackson C.,/user_details?userid=P_dOYp9fIaQ2W9OVDaUFPA,"Manhattan, NY",5/22/2015,1,The worst service ever  the food not as italian as the restaurant looks very bad experience . Prices too high not worth the time and money .
Fatima Y.,/user_details?userid=zbYyzIarF_EqQEfR5IqgNA,"Atlanta, GA",9/22/2014,5,Visiting New York for the first time and stopped to tour little Italy. This restaurant was very packed therefore enticing me to go in. We ate there and not only was the service A++++ but the food was AMAZING!! I literally cleaned my plate! I recommend this place 100% and am shocked the rating wasn't higher than this! EXCELLENT!! Also the wine was amazing! Just awesome!
Lau T.,/user_details?userid=AjAQIR_gfVZBc50H5vDiuw,"New York, NY",6/26/2016,1,I had ordered the Spaghetti Marinara and the Gnocchi with Bolognese sauce. The flavor is lacking. Where are the herbs? The handmade gnocchi was chewy and unevenly shaped. If you have had proper gnocchi- chewy is NEVER an adjective used. It was a mouthful of out of the jar supermarket brand sauce. Very disappointing.
Bob C.,/user_details?userid=M19Vk74yPpTGg7jm_AKoIw,"San Diego, CA",6/26/2014,4,"Had another fantastic meal at this spot. As far as I'm concerned, this is the best restaurant on Mulberry Street. Try the chicken parm, rigatoni with vodka sauce. Service is consistently good and the atmosphere near the street is awesome."
Christina D.,/user_details?userid=tWkGOGs2WukIW8yAS0LwbQ,"Morristown, NJ",9/20/2014,1,Unsastified with service and food! I could get better service at Bensi!!! The server never came to check on us! We had to wait for over 20 mins for the check!! The greeter was overly animated and was pretending to know us when we never went to this place!! Would never go back!!

As always, food is very good ... Tasty and rich in flavor.  Rigatoni a la vodka is excellent and so is capelini primavera.  I've had them both.  The best restaurant on Mulberry Street in my opinion!"
Bexx M.,/user_details?userid=4mQ7Q1kqFDWmRD_pbdXq7Q,"Elmsford, NY",1/2/2016,4,"Went for lunch today. We both had a glass of sangria ($11/ea ) which was really good but I might ask how much a carafe is next time. We had bread and house infused olive oil while waiting for our entrees. The bread was good, the oil was great. I ordered the lasagna lunch portion. It was a meat lasagna which surprised me, but it was delicious. Hubby got the chicken parmigiana lunch special that came with linguine and a small salad, all on one plate. The chicken was really good, the pasta appeared and tasted like it was from a box which was unfortunate as the lasagna noodles seemed freshly made. The waiters were extremely soft spoken, so we found ourselves asking them to repeat themselves over the din of the restaurant. Would go back but won't make a special trip for it."

Irwin L.,/user_details?userid=wJBfKwyxxA0Z9NWoq61S8Q,"San Jose, CA",6/3/2009,2,"My friends and I got hustled while walking down the strip of Little Italy. Waiters flashing lunch specials at you should be a clear sign that the food was probably not too good. Anyways, we were seated and given our menus. Maybe it was just me but the menu was too big and confusing for it's own good. I decided on the lobster ravioli. It came out on a huge white dish with literally three circular blobs and ketchup water layered on top of it. You can't even taste the damn lobster! Honestly, I could have just took my tourist ass to a local Walmart, buy a can of Chef Boyardee and call it a day. I would've saved 15 bucks and my stomach would have been satisfied. Maybe I'm being too harsh. The complementary bread and garlic dipping oil was tasty though."
Philippe D.,/user_details?userid=ZgEnGhJTg7mvLY2a5fYkNg,"Seattle, WA",7/21/2013,4,"Really delicious Italian food. The fettuccine alfredo was delicious.

The restaurant ambiance is great, couple of people standby for hospitality and a nice wine selction. Prices were standard and overall experience was nice. I loved my lamb shank and cheese ravioli. The bread was delicious alongside the pesto in the olive oil. Loved this italian gem in this city :)"
Sarah O.,/user_details?userid=kx2kvadTQTGzToouxP9owA,"Seattle, WA",10/26/2016,3,"On our NY trip, my husband and I had to visit Little Italy, even though we knew it was a tourist trap. We decided to have dinner here after a little coercing from the host and sat at an outside table - even though it was dark and rainy! The host was happy to accommodate us. We ordered the calamari, veal parmigiana and shrimp pesto pappardelle. They were all pretty good - nothing amazing though."
Anthony F.,/user_details?userid=Prf3IP6z1u37kRAp5b_C1g,"New York, NY",12/18/2007,1,"If you enjoy the smell of dead mice then you would enjoy eating at Da Gennaro that appears to be beautiful, but is poorly maintained. We waited 10 minutes to get a seat and finaly were seated near a ledge with flower pots on them. We were handed the menus to look at and just as I looked out to my right I saw a dead mouse in the flower pot next to me. I can't eat in a place like that I know this is NYC but come on dead mice shows poor management and the Department of Health should check it out. Do Not Eat at a filthy place like this...!!"
Alicia S.,/user_details?userid=UXlEXdhMTP4MaEh4gY5MUA,"Birmingham, MI",10/24/2018,5,"I stumbled across this place a little over a year ago, and I make sure to stop every time I come to NYC. I tell friends! If you are looking for a cute little Italian restaurant, this is it!!! My friend who isn't a heavy drinker, polished off 4 Italian margaritas. I'm assuming they were fantastic, but I always have to get their homemade sangria. So there is my drink suggestion. Appetizers... beef carpaccio, hands down the best! For dinner I've ordered the lobster ravioli every time I go. It's soooo good! I've tried the traditional meat sauce and it's amazing on the pasta and lasagna. It's not that sweet sauce some restaurants try to pass off as edible. If you like crappy sweet pasta sauce, there is a  nasty place across the street from this place that is right up your alley! The fettuccini Alfredo was delicious as well. For dessert if you have room has got to be creme brûlée. I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but please go here! If this place ever closes I'll cry"
Alexa K.,/user_details?userid=YNDPN4fvxyB3rg5HalTEZA,"Manhattan, NY",3/16/2016,4,Good food. Nice ambiance. Better than a lot of the Italian I've tried in Little Italy.
Beatrice C.,/user_details?userid=Jk0mUin2mPmziL_5ZxbKkQ,"Queens, NY",6/9/2012,1,"Came here with a friend and the manager outside convinced us to come in. We ordered a pitcher of sangria which wasn't bad but definitely wasn't the best. There was ice in the sangria which I am not used to. We ordered the hot antipasto for 2, so since it said for 2 we anticipated a large dish, we were dreadfully wrong. The plate was a GREAT DISSAPOINTMENT!! Every item was not up to par. The stuffed pepper, I can't even tell you what it was stuffed with, it was all mush with no taste. The eggplant rollitini tasted like it was microwaved, it was also mushy and had no taste except for the glob of cheese they threw over it. Honestly the highlight of our meal was teh bread basket sadly. After the digusting antipasto we did not want to order anything else. It was the worst meal I have ever had."
David H.,/user_details?userid=mNThBJWugDeu_lRRsZzIsg,"Meatpacking District, Manhattan, NY",10/16/2012,2,"It's seems for bad Chinese food you go to China town and for bad Italian you head down to little Italy. I would be amazed if any one of Italy would eat here the food is like high end supermarket ready to go meals, served by a Mexican with cheesy music in the background and tourists trying to translate the menu and worrying about the cost. If your stuck in little Italy and want to get out of the rain it's fine for anything else stay away"
Theresa H.,/user_details?userid=iaKF3_wI6C5PKxFXaPM9-A,"Linthicum Heights, MD",9/30/2014,5,Absolutely delicious!! Had spaghetti and meatballs. Meatballs were very tender.

Athenais A.,/user_details?userid=eFXzmjhlMY9z2HLLscdAUA,"New York, NY",3/21/2012,5,"Trust me when I say that this is the BEST Italian you will find in Little Italy - I live here and have been to most.  Not to mention, that on a beautiful day, you can just sit outside, dine and wine and never feel rushed.  Don't hesitate - pick Da Gennaro! :)  Yum, yum, yum!  What more can I say?  Once you're seated, they bring out the yummiest bread with some amazing olive oil, garlic, parmesan cheese concoction that is irresistible (there is no way you're only having one slice of bread).  Their marinara sauce is the stuff dreams are made of!  Try the ""fried cheese"" appetizer.  Trust me, you won't regret it.  It's almost like a grilled cheese...then you dunk it in that marinara sauce, and let's just say you don't ever want to leave Da Gennaro.  Additionally, their pasta is sooooo good.  They have many delicious options and none of them disappoint.  I have tried three different ones and all of them were delicious.  My favorite was a tomato cream sauce base with prosciutto and peas.  I seriously have to roll out of this place every time I leave.  They also have reasonably priced bottles and a delicious tiramisu (and I'm not even a fan of tiramisu).  The owner is beyond nice and friendly.  She happened to sit next to us one day to complete paperwork and chatted me and my friend up.  Thanks to her, we tried that delicious dessert, on the house."
Damon O.,/user_details?userid=GHmDKQds7PNGT1aI2kiXIw,"Hummelstown, PA",12/22/2015,5,"We ordered a pasta sampler plus lobster ravioli plus meatballs.

You won't be disappointed."
Vicky N.,/user_details?userid=lxxfZdJUKZ0RjWUOFf3eQw,"Fountain Valley, CA",6/12/2010,3,"Complimentary bread and olive oil? It's okay, the bread was hard, but the olive oil with stuff in it made it a little tasty. My fettuccine alfredo was also okay. My friend's penne pasta with alfredo sauce was watered down.

Kristin C.,/user_details?userid=g74JUGLpirgZpfz6RsZ29A,"Chicago, IL",9/29/2008,3,"We stumbled across Da Gennaro while strolling through Little Italy. With so many restaurants to choose from, it was hard to pick one place to dine, and honestly, we chose this place because there were A. people in it, and B. it was raining, but they had some seats in the window that were covered. It was a nice change of pace (read: cost) to go somewhere with a lunch special. We both got the chicken parmesan special, which came with a side salad and pasta. It was a good portion size, not too small and not too big. We also both got a glass of white wine -- and we were both convinced that the wine was half water, because it was pretty bad. Either that, or it sat out without a cork for weeks. Other than that, the service was attentive, food was good and the setting was cute and cozy. We opted out of the tiramisu for a scoop of gelato down the street ...a great decision on our part!"
Jim M.,/user_details?userid=gFSTuWhyZYigaSi9bnCJPQ,"Antioch, TN",9/3/2016,5,One of the best restaurants in the city. The management treats people with incredible respect and they provide some of the best Italian food I've ever eaten. And I'm Italian!
Angie F.,/user_details?userid=q3w54EFXORlGZN9lG_6zSw,"Manhattan, NY",4/17/2016,4,Food was amazing. Drinks were even better. Service was a little disappointing. We had 10 different people wait on us and it took forever just to get a menu. BUT worth the wait :)
Carla G.,/user_details?userid=WtYSBuN4pakEpM9oTUQMgA,"ASTORIA, NY",4/28/2012,4,"With so many restaurants in Little Italy to choose from, this one is hands down my favorite!  It is now my automatic ""go to"" restaurant in Little Italy.  The food is very good and moderately priced and the wine list has a lot to choose from and many bottles that are very resonable.  Every dish that I had tried has been very good to excellent.  The service is always great and I had the pleasure of meeting the owner one afternoon and she was great!  She has a passion for her work and it shows in every meal that I have had here."
Victoria S.,/user_details?userid=uDgz8pNy--SQm6Ae3uRiFg,"El Segundo, CA",6/20/2011,3,"Da Gennaro is one of the many in Little Italy. We were trying to find the perfect combination of fresh pasta, good wine and interesting views. After going to several, we landed at Da Gennaro's because of the entertaining and charming host i.e. cute Italian guy. He promised us a meal to our liking and showed us to our table. We order a few pinot grigios, chianti and a cheese pie and my friend had the breaded veal cutlet. The bread was fresh and they had a great olive and parm oil dip. The pizza pie was just OK. Not a bad meal but not great...but it was worth it for the atmosphere."

The atmosphere is great, and can be perfect for a group of friends or a date. I love it in the warmer months when we can sit outside :)"

I enjoyed a plate of pasta, (francheise) cooked to perfection. Prices were decent for lunch...I would not dine anywhere in little Italy for dinner...personally for me the dinner prices just aren't worth it. But definitely stop by any little Italy restaurant for lunch. Oh the sangria was great but the small pitcher only serves 3 and a half cups! I was expecting a larger size but it was delicious."

Gia P.,/user_details?userid=qautyIOVBoVdbR2cIFgktA,"Manhattan, NY",11/10/2015,3,"Added 2 stars because: a. Service was great. Everyone was very attentive and my server was excellent.  b. The restaurant is beautiful and the atmosphere is very cozy and romantic. Could've been perfect for a date if... the food was better and the wine wasn't very cheap quality. My average check at a typical Italian restaurant usually ranges at $50-70 per person, here I felt ripped off for paying $30."

The food was all pretty good and not too pricey. I would eat here again but I'd like to experience the more authentic restaurants Little Italy has to offer.."

Julaine N.,/user_details?userid=5IO9i-2ItRTb4ADnKtQwZg,"Frederick, MD",3/6/2011,2,"The food is okay. The service is poor. They try to cram too many people in this place and the waiters awkwardly try to find a place to stand. Twice a waiter knocked the food on our table without an apology. The seasoned olive oil they serve with the bread is amazing, but the rest of the food, especially the marinara sauce, needs work. The acidity of the marinara makes it taste like it came from a can. Overall I think there are better options to explore in little Italy. This place was just okay."
Ra- T.,/user_details?userid=D7xwP5hmsUyu2HF9_qyOUg,"Avondale, AZ",11/20/2012,5,"My wife and I were at this Italian restaurant for dinner on our last day of vacation in NY,  the place is the best Italian restaurant in the area,  The food was delicious and the staff super attentive, the owner Giovanni ,  great guy he takes care of his guests just as if they were family.  Remember when in New York visit Little Italy's best Italian restaurant ""Da Gennaro"" and ask for Giovanni you'll know what I am talking about...    oh and order pasta carbonara  and a glass of wine to go with that.     Mama miaaaaaa. busy little place but very cozy and great service, go here to be a part of a true Italian dinning experience."
Katie A.,/user_details?userid=J1DjS3v1rdo-GsaFgT8C6w,"Youngstown, OH",5/28/2016,2,"My family and I have been coming to this spot for years and have always been impressed with the quality of the service and the food. We came to the restaurant on a Saturday evening around 7:30 and were very disappointed in our experience. All of our pasta's very over cooked and under salted. We had to ask multiple times for pepper flakes and fresh forks and got our food halfway through our companies meals. Overall, the quality was subpar. Most definitely a tourist spot due to it being located in Little Italy, but most definitely not worth the lack of air conditioning in the NYC heat."
Melinda F.,/user_details?userid=b0q-O-_8NN7s8czdEHscZQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/27/2016,3,The menu descriptions made everything sound great...or maybe I was just really hungry...but very underwhelming when your dish arrived. They could be more creative in ingredients and presentation. Flavor was good although everything seemed over salted. It is borderline good.
Vanessa S.,/user_details?userid=WvfQHMfYjQ6DuI0wh9s4bg,"Brooklyn, NY",7/29/2014,5,"5 Stars !!  My husband and i are on vacation in nyc we decided to visit little italy and we found this amazing restaurant , i had this lobster ravioliss  and let me tell you the best raviolis i ever had my husband did the pesto gnoccis , fresh pasta .

Anchal A.,/user_details?userid=ieEeGhPSUFe2h2ps9IZaGA,"Bellevue, WA",9/5/2015,1,Horrible service.. Food was good but there was no hospitality at all. The waiters were rude and non responsive.

Julian C.,/user_details?userid=DKSjs_ghI8ddh5ZK3RdvXg,"Manhattan, NY",7/19/2016,4,"Da Gennaro was a great place. We went for lunch and enjoyed our meal. I ordered the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and it was delicious, and fair priced ( like many of the other lunch specials). This place was very clean; And had a good atmosphere. I plan on returning."
Amanda Taplin M.,/user_details?userid=_IzH_0iCUR1qmU_N2m8cxw,"Union City, NJ",9/26/2014,1,"This place is absolutely terrible. We came in late and the manager threw a menu at us and said ""order now."" Little did they know all we wanted was some wine and dessert. I told him that and they were nice afterwards. They brought everything out at once which was fine and then made us wait over 25 minutes for the bill while the manager gave another table free drinks at the end of night and lemoncello. They were so incredibly rude. I work for a PR company and would never recommend this place to anyone or any client I will ever work with. It's absolutely awful. Please do yourself a favor and never go here."
Heidi P.,/user_details?userid=PMLpk2GmSccHknDRgR0a2g,"Placerville, CA",7/8/2008,4,"This was my first trip to NY and Little Italy. We were with 4 children and 4 adults. We wanted to sit on the side walk so we could watch all the people go bye. Right away they started moving tables and bringing chairs for us. The place was TOTALLY crowed ed yet, they promptly made room for us. Service was a little slow. Had a hard time getting refills on my new phews colas. I had the special chicken Parm. It was a little dry, yet all the cheese and pasta sauce made it yummy. I collect wine creates. The one wooden ones with the name of the winery stamped on the outside. I spotted one that looked like they were going to throw out. The wine box had been shipped from Italy and I wanted that box so badly. My sister in law asked our waiter if I could have it and he said, ""IMPOSSIBLE"" being Italian her self she said nothing is impossible. When our bill came our waiter made me so happy by giving me the coveted box. I'm looking at it right now. Its in my living room next to my Peju wine box up on my  shelf. LOVE IT!!"

Alison M.,/user_details?userid=4qJME-01inmlf4ysMKPeNg,"Washington, DC",11/16/2009,3,"I totally felt like I was walking into a tourist trap here, but pretty much all the restaurants on Mullberry looked the same way. The bf was hungry and cranky so we tried our luck at Da Gennaro. I almost walked out when the hostess tried to seat us at someone else's table,but the were kind and put us a a private table in the back. The decor here looks like it hasn't been cleaned or updated in years. There were fake flower pots outside on the window sills, the menus were dirty and the paintings on the walls were crooked. There were also so many tables in this place that you can barely get to your table without climbing over someone. Surprisingly the food was actually very good. I ordered an eggplant, tomato pasta dish and the bf had ravioli. We both cleaned our plates, but I don't think that makes up for the atmosphere. I wouldn't come here again."

When I went back the experience was definitely a positive one, I will be back."
melissa l.,/user_details?userid=NZqLZI64LDYAAjnjdq-AYA,"San Diego, CA",2/16/2012,5,We sat at a table next to the open wall. Perfect. The flavored olive oil and bread was yum! I ate the pesto gnocchi. Amazing! Great experience!
Jeremy P.,/user_details?userid=4Tawn1t3QJq8-J9QOpMybw,"American Fork, UT",6/13/2013,4,We had pizza and loved it.  The atmosphere was great.  We talked to the grandson of the original owner.  There were some great stories of the past that gave this place an even better expirience.
Kaitlin O.,/user_details?userid=FHArGT9sXSi6yVncFLfyrQ,"Eastpoint, FL",8/4/2015,4,Great food and service. Lunch specials were just what we needed to power through the rest of the day. House wine selection was very good also. Little Italy definitely got a little more touristy as you go up Mulberry.
Anthony C.,/user_details?userid=R5fIehDdHNqCLguf2nhFSw,"La Jolla, CA",7/21/2011,4,"This is the ""go-to"" place for my family when it comes to a quick lunch or dinner in Little Italy. The bread is warm and fresh and coupled with the house special olive oil dip, it is irresistible. Try to linguini and the chicken - you'd be enjoying every bite of it!"
L N.,/user_details?userid=dxJo5yCQjgGUU88gjweiEw,"Salt Lake City, UT",2/24/2012,4,"Food was amazing! I had the Pasta Trio! Lots of food and tasted delicious! Reason for the 4 star instead of a 5 is due to service. Was hard to get service, drinks refilled, bread, etc. Once your seated your kind of forgot about."
Leah M.,/user_details?userid=991Kl_jseNXkcARCDS8q-A,"San Francisco, CA",3/4/2012,3,"Don't t get the stuffed artichoke. But great service, the bread and olive oil is to die for and the food is so-so. Pretty expensive too for the neighborhood and for the food we got. MayBe we just ordered the wrong thing but it def wasn't worth the price we paid."
M.R. P.,/user_details?userid=9NVI8KI2GrNpXEomh1WuUg,"Duxbury, MA",3/1/2016,1,Patrons beware! Went in on Valentine's day with husband. Food average but not outstanding. My review has more to do with their business practice - overcharging their customers! I noticed on my credit card statement I was overcharged over 3X my tab! Have called to speak to the owner or manager on over 4 occasions and have been told each time they are not in and to call back. I have even left my name and contact number. No response. Now I feel it prudent to warn the public.

Mabelyn M.,/user_details?userid=ZQzom7124JdSoKRTJFoopw,"Jersey City, NJ",7/21/2010,4,While in NY last week my boyfriend and I decided to have dinner in Little Italy. I hadn't been in the neighborhood since I was a child and I didn't remember there being SOOOO many options of restaurants on one street. We finally decided on Da Gennaro being the host out front convinced us we would love it. I highly recommend the ravioli in pink sauce and the mozzarella caprese. And the tiramisu is really good. This place will be my official Little Italy restaurant when I go to NY.

Gus B.,/user_details?userid=S1q8lFSTCPOnckyMQaV5yg,"North Miami Beach, FL",10/17/2011,3,This place is always full. Great atmosphere however don't expect the best food knowledge from waiters. I ordered the tilapia with sautéed veggies. I asked if there was any oil and they said no it is steamed. Let's just say the food came in oil soup.

Jen C.,/user_details?userid=TsZBZ7aI5SSkvfLHp_qGIw,"Ontario, CA",1/23/2013,5,We just had appetizers & wine here. It was so delicious. We definitely recommend trying the stuffed artichoke & the Italian grilled cheese. The olive oil for the bread is sooooo delicious. We bought some to go!
James T.,/user_details?userid=9kT21eSeyX8AXII8wTh1TA,"New York, NY",9/13/2015,1,"The food here is terrible! Bland pizza sauce, cheap cheese. Flavorless lasagna that was mostly bechamel sauce with almost no meat. I guess this place relies on the never-see-em-again tourist trade."
Alicia M.,/user_details?userid=bdDvf7ezhpn32lf6Vl-Z1Q,"Buffalo, NY",10/12/2014,2,"Not impressed. It was busy but we were seated right away and quickly brought some water. This was about the best service we got all night. They took our order and 2 pasta dishes and a chicken special was ordered. The food was good... not really any complaints there but the chicken special did not have a price on the menu but seeing the steak and seafood we reasonably priced, I imagined the chicken would be in the $20 range like the other chicken on the menu seeing this meal seemed very similar but with the addition of cheese. The chicken was tasty but it was just a small piece of chicken with spinach (that tasted like it had been in the freezer for a little too long), Mushrooms, and mozzarella.. Long story short, we get the check and see that my small piece of chicken was $31.99. I couldn't believe it. Seeing the steak and lobster was about $35, I was flabbergasted my chicken would cost close to that. The dipping oil for the bread was by far the best we have ever had. On to the service, or lack their of. We asked for balsamic vinegar, extra napkins, and cheese for our meal and got nothing. Each subsequent time we asked for something, we reminded them about the first thing we asked for and no dice. Meal was $110 for 3 people. We wouldn't go back ."

Pure tourist trap... pretty sure most of the menu wasn't even actually Italian dishes but rather American versions of Italian dishes. The best thing I got was the side of broccoli sauteed in garlic. Everything else was tasteless and definitely not fresh.
Kevin G.,/user_details?userid=xjNOSHObAtmQ69JvsOLQAA,"Naperville, IL",8/8/2014,5,"Quite the hidden gem of NYC. Quite definitely the best Italian food I have ever eaten. I highly recommend the chicken Alfredo and the lobster ravioli.

Jeffrey G.,/user_details?userid=WJOhcWl2Rhk8W8MkgcPmHg,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",12/20/2015,4,Enjoyable dinner with the family. Very good service with attention to detail even though it was extremely busy. Good was well prepared and all came out together and hot. The pasta carbonara was done just right!  The vodka sauce is well balanced and have to say the tiramisu was a great surprise.  Would definitely recommend this place especially at this price point.
Stephanie M.,/user_details?userid=xMG78yMbgkKjfF7px2KPww,"Herriman, UT",5/7/2013,3,The bread and olive oil served at the beginning of the meal was delicious. The Gnocchi was excellent but the Risotto ala Milanese was below average (not sure there was any saffron actually in it). It was also really cold when we were there at the beginning of February so I had to put my coat back on.
Jim B.,/user_details?userid=EIGwGuU0C0CT0cxxTeigRw,"Plano, TX",12/21/2014,4,"Very good.  Recommend trying something off specials, as that was the best.  Regular pasta dishes good but nothing unique, but the specials menu was the bomb!"
E B.,/user_details?userid=dkU_UY9m9O97P1CJAk4oQQ,"Township of Washington, NJ",8/18/2014,1,"This restaurant was very disappointing. The bread was stale and tasted re-heated. I ordered chicken scarpiello. The chicken was dried out and overcooked it. I even got a chewy bone. It was also totally flavorless. This restaurant was full of tourists from other countries. It is obvious locals do not eat here. For the price, I am sure there are much better restaurants in Little Italy that serve better food."
Erin M.,/user_details?userid=newNHuAsLzkC-0KsEZK4KA,"Irvine, CA",4/24/2012,4,"I walked into this place because it was the most crowded restaurant on the street. My logic was...if it was this busy, it must be good. I was right. I had a salad, cheese ravioli with a 1/2 lobster and dessert. It was really yummy! Very friendly. Reasonably priced. I would recommend and I would come back...if I lived in NY."
Grace P.,/user_details?userid=Ii2mgC6eJaLFcWlYgncf8A,"Jersey City, NJ",9/11/2012,2,"Disappointing.  I am a new transport to the New York City area, so as I was exploring the city and I thought it would be a good idea to go to Little Italy to get authentic Italian food (emphasis on authentic).  We picked Da Gennaro because it seemed busy and the ambience was nice.  The five of us ordered pasta dishes.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan with linguine.  When I tried my food and got a sampling of everyone elses, I regretted not staying home and just getting take-out.  My neighborhood take-out place tastes much better.  Even I could probably make better pasta.   It was a far cry from authentic and I was so disappointed.  But if you are already there, the best of the dishes we tried was the parpadelle with mushrooms.  In the future, I think I would be reluctant to go to Little Italy now.  I can't help but question the authenticity of all of the restaurants there."
Hank C.,/user_details?userid=PSDSdUHIEGW3189cGc7XMg,"Whitsett, NC",6/18/2013,5,Great food and fantastic atmosphere! The bread and olive oil was awesome... Hope to come here again!
Serhat A.,/user_details?userid=Xi2-KgyGusjlrYhGew4rgQ,"Manhattan, NY",5/26/2014,2,Portions are not big enough though service was pretty fast. Do not take tricolor salad. It's just the greens. Taste of pasta was enough. I do not advise.

Jaime R.,/user_details?userid=KS0TQc1WaxAAQm-YOW6MnA,"Chula Vista, CA",8/25/2010,1,On a Saturday night the service was mediocre. I ordered a lasagna(yeah I'm a tourist) and I got a kids portion! To top it off it had cheap gum like mozarella. I was dissapointed I felt that they prey on tourist and give you an Italian accent to lure you into believing it is authentic.

Joe C.,/user_details?userid=EKqa5NMnFRH9cjOouSIhcg,"Arlington, VA",1/12/2014,4,"The girlfriend and I were playing tourist in NYC. We stumbled on to this joint on mulberry street accidentally. First off, let me say, that we did not encounter any of the negatives that we read on previous posts. Service was on the money! Very friendly and prompt-refills on water etc. girl had the chicken with eggplant Ina brown sauce. It was huge but very tender and very nice little number. I had the stuffed shells-excellent. The bread and olive oil dip was off the hook good. Good Martini as well. Staff was very friendly all around. Saw one of the waiters give a comp Bloody Mary to a group of chicks seated next to us.  I give it four stars just because I thought the shell portion size was a bit small."

Unfortunately the man working outside was quite aggressive and got us away from the location we were headed. I was reading yelp reviews but missed the ones that were ""not recommended."" I got the chicken parmesan and pasta and my husband got the lasagna. The chicken parmesan was overcooked and lukewarm. Honestly I believe it was cooked the day before. The pasta wasn't terrible but was barely warm. My husband's lasagna looked more like a frozen meal and tasted at least 3 days old. Nice ambiance but the food is unacceptable. My meal was taken off thankfully but my husband and I lost the opportunity to have a nice meal on our day trip to the city and my husband had to clog his arteries with terrible food. I ended up eating a food bar which is quite a shame considering all of the good food in NYC."

Friendly staff and great service!!"
Jason H.,/user_details?userid=MXcYK1NCAKlPK5Ugf7cUyQ,"ASTORIA, NY",10/17/2013,5,I decided to try this place since I was around there.. Wanted to surprise my wife.. As soon as I went there they gladly attended us rite away.. We ordered tortellini soup it was fabulous and some Alfredo pasta delicious!  Even the bread was tasty!! My wife was so satisfied and so was I.. The service was excellent not to mention that our server Alex was amazing! He made our dinner special!! Thanks to him for an amazing time.. We will for sure go back there really soon!

We were not sure where to eat when Massimo approached us, told us they specialized in homemade pasta and sat us right away. Service was Great, very attentive, water glasses always kept full. The oil for the bread was the best we ever had. We had chicken rollatino with linguini, veal parmigano, and penne in a pink sauce, all was exceptional. Loved the atmosphere with the accordian player. Priced fairly. Highly recommend this spot when you want to eat in Little Italy!"
Veronica L.,/user_details?userid=L6r_mihq9Of5u3HObReqRg,"Coachella, CA",9/8/2015,1,"So I'm  from southern cali, and I took a vacation with a friend to new York recently. We decided to check out little Italy for dinner one night. Some of the waiters from Da Gennaro pulled us off the street and offered us a table, it was great. That was until I received my chicken premagania which looked and tasted great up until I pulled a long black curly hair from my mouth, it was in my pasta!! And I have red hair so I know it wasn't mine! not only that but the hair was twisted and really deep in my pasta. Now I am a server myself, so I understand mistakes happen, I just sent the food back and asked for a new one, while that was transpiring I took a bite of my friends food and also bit into a hair!! So then the server who was a complete jerk and totally unattentive came by and I told him what happened, he rolled his eyes and insisted on bringing over Roberto the manager. Roberto was truly and utterly unprofessional he said we were the ""only table"" giving him problems and said ""none of our cooks have long curly black hair"" basically insinuating the friend I was with put her hair in the food. He was not at all apologetic. The half ass apology he did eventually  give was not at all genuine. It wasn't the hairs so much that bothered me, it was Robertos response and crude attitude that set me off and as soon as they brought over my new plate of chicken premagania, I gave it right back to the busser and walked away, but not before I looked at Roberto and told him I felt he wasn't sorry, because he wasn't. I will probably only get to visit New York a few more times in my life but I will definitely make sure to NEVER visit this place again. Makes me sick even thinking about it, my restaurant manager would have never handled this situation in such a fashion. And I hope the owners consider giving Roberto proper customer service training, or maybe getting rid of him all together. BAD FOR BUSINESS!"
Lauren D.,/user_details?userid=uFOGvTGXY_MfEyStMqrfNg,"Philadelphia, PA",12/12/2013,5,"Our favorite spot in little Italy. Delicious food, priced well, great people watching and a fun atmosphere. We will definitely be returning."
Man Chi N.,/user_details?userid=ZvV6qNZbKrT82scd3y_RYw,"Manhattan, NY",5/9/2012,2,"Came here last night with 3 friends for dinner since they were craving pasta. The bread and olive oil was the only redeeming part of this meal. We were waiting for a friend inside the restaurant and the waiters kept asking us if we were ready to order. When we were finally ready, no one came by to take our order. After ordering, we waited a while to get our food which was strange considering how it wasn't crowded and the other patrons are eating their food. My friend ordered the pasta with pesto sauce and it tasted like Alfredo sauce with a little pieces of basil, not appetizing at all. My other friend got the calamari with marina sauce with linguini and the calamari wasn't fresh. I got the breaded veal and linguini and it was average. Had to chase the wait staff down for fresh pepper and he was talking to another server while grounding the pepper and didn't hear us say stop until we screamed at him. They were being very pushy with trying to make us order dessert but I sternly told him no thanks and get us the check. With that type of service, they would've been lucky to get 15% but 17% tip was already included so we just paid for our meal and quickly left the restaurant. As a New Yorker, I am convinced the restaurants in Little Italy are tourist traps. Too expensive for terrible service and less than mediocre food."
Dee B.,/user_details?userid=T9LGx2I-dciSBOcfdHxNGw,"NJ, NJ",7/1/2008,4,"My daughter and I had a great meal at Da Gennaro's. Both the food and the service was outstanding.

Debbie C.,/user_details?userid=2T8pLlObwjmCsXq_9TcnVA,"White Plains, NY",4/22/2013,3,"I stopped by this restaurant after already eating across the street, which did not prove to be a wise choice.  I should have started at Da Gennaro Restaurant.  The gentlemen David outside was a pleasure! Truly helped to make a great afternoon there even better!  Staff so polite and helpful.  Kudos to you Da Gennaro and not only will I be back but will start out with you first!!  Looking forward to seeing David outside again!!"
Elaine K.,/user_details?userid=TLu3JnDOVdlvlSr2S3X6AQ,"Manhattan, NY",6/28/2014,5,"I have been a customer here for at least 10 years and I find the food excellent and the service impeccable. I have special dietary needs and they always graciously accommodate me. As pharmaceutical rep, my clients were always pleased with their food and especially enjoyed their delicious olive oil, herb and Parmesan dip for the bread and the high quality of their entrees. The owners, Akram and Massy are always gracious. I'm not good with names but when I come its usually Alex or Simon who take care of me, and I have not found one waiter lacking. I think as with any excellent restaurant, there is sometimes a little wait when they're busy, but not a problem. It astounds me that yelp offers a pizza place as an alternative. No comparison."

Jolene K.,/user_details?userid=13t4E39aQbBD0SxcLAAisg,"New Fairfield, CT",12/18/2009,1,"My daughter and I went to NYC to see the tree. Being Italian I wanted to have a nice lunch in Little Italy, or what is left of it.  There is nothing left there except maybe one block and one good Italian deli. Everywhere you go there are Chinese people coming up to you asking you to buy purses. They are rude and very aggressive. Nothing was worse than the barker that this ristorante has in front. He came right up to us and started talking about how they have home made pasta and blah blah blah. But he put his arm around my 22 year old daughter and was forcing her into the place. He was all over her with his mouth kissing her. Finally she had to shove him off of her. I am waiting for them to open to complain. She really felt violated. How dare he put his hands on her. We went to S.P.Q.R right next store and had a wonderful Italian meal. With respectful waitors and no barkers!"
Andres G.,/user_details?userid=-k6xMG0l-PFvKwKKnptSZw,"Los Angeles, CA",7/7/2013,1,Sooooo it was good up until we got the bill having not told us there was no free refills sooooo wack so they get a 1 star. It wasn't even on the menu that they charge for refills.
H S.,/user_details?userid=I85HG2hja3RjZYJCEAS70A,"Boston, MA",8/8/2010,3,"Pretty yummy, typical Italian place with some nice outdoor seating. Able to snag a seat that overlooked Mulberry, I spent most of my meal people watching while sipping on some red. Not too shabby. The barker outside was very entertaining to watch... ""table for four? no? okay fine, go.... sir, sir! table for 2? follow me""-- man what a weird little job, and the place was pretty packed anyway! The waiter was sweet, but the service was unfortunately a little slow. Food was good but typical Italian food that you could definitely get anywhere else in the area."
Michele S.,/user_details?userid=ASGsmMJqsJYer8PjcpNv_Q,"Naples, FL",9/12/2012,5,"Maybe it's because I was so excited to be in New York again for a day or maybe it's because the staff was so darn friendly and sweet, but I had to give Da Gennaro's 5 stars!  After meandering up and down in Little Italy; being harrassed all the while much like they do on Lincoln Road in Miami; I was going to eat at Il Cortile....a place I've been before and enjoyed.  However, the gentleman there was soooo damn pushy, that I moved on and I'm glad I did.  Massimo pestered me as well; but in a good way and I was seated outside for a wonderful dinner.  It started with their wonderful dipping oil; olive oil, chopped fresh italian parsley, parmesean, garlic and red pepper flakes....served with wonderful New York bread, it was almost a meal in itself.  At $9 a glass, the cabernet was pricey; but hey, it's New York.  I ordered a tri-colore salad which truthfully needed some parmesean on top (which they abliged) and some more salt & pepper, then it was perfect.  For my entree, I ordered the arrabiatta and asked for a little of the cream sauce mixed in to have a spicy pink sauce.  It was so fantastic I had to stop myself from licking the plate!  I finished it off with a cappucino; also excellent.  All in all, I had a really nice experience there; great food and even better staff!"
AM S.,/user_details?userid=rWBt1uyzcsB55jNfWkDzDQ,"Manhattan, NY",2/12/2014,3,Food was great.  Minus two stars because we were shoved in a back cold awkward room even though we had reservations (would have liked to sit in the front lively warm room especially since I was with my Mother and Grandmother who were visiting).
Daphne O.,/user_details?userid=B9avZsUMpF0GbJ6wWQ6C7Q,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",6/24/2013,4,Between 2 adults and 2 children We split two of the Chef Specials and were not dissappointed. It was plenty of food to feed everyone and very tasty. We weren't able to get a seat outside but the restaurant is open air and we could still feel the energy of the street outside. Would definitely reccommend!
Greg D.,/user_details?userid=lg0ZViwXduHCxSO6uDuE5A,"Logansport, IN",8/10/2012,5,the BEST gnocchi i've ever had!  words cannot begin to describe how wonderful my meal was.  the bread and olive oil dipping sauce...extraordinary!
Annette F.,/user_details?userid=e6whLoxy12LrCHFSZhvkOA,"Scottsdale, AZ",9/10/2010,5,"The best around....the sauce is amazing!  Try the apple sangria, particularly in the summer!  Meatballs are almost like my grandma's (and she's Italian!)  Desserts are to die for and atmosphere rivals the best."
Alexandra H.,/user_details?userid=ujHgMjxvZ8QGwBo_5Mbtiw,"Los Angeles, CA",3/16/2011,5,Went with my friend while we were on vacation in NYC. We knew we wanted to eat in Lilttle Italy but not sure where. Cab dropped us off on Mulberry St. and we walked and checked out the restaurants on the st. We noticed Da Gennaro because it was cute and romantic. They had there lunch specials on the board outside the restaurant. While we were looking at it the restaurants host came out and let us know about other specials they had going on. We decided to eat here. We were seated real quick and are server was real nice to let us choose where to sit and made sure we were not cold since we picked a table next to the outside tables. We ordered sparkling water and wine and they arrived to are table quickly despite the restaurant being packed. Minutes later the busboy brought out some fresh bread with oil which was warm and good.  I ordered the shrimp pasta in pink sause and it was do die for. Our food and drinks were at are table quickly and our water glasses were never empty our server was constantly coming around to check on us. The atmosphere was great service was great the food was excellent.  Totally recommend this place.
Lissi G.,/user_details?userid=hkDOWpzWL4OhcBuxArr4Zg,"Thousand Oaks, CA",10/10/2011,5,Have been here 3 times now. Everytime I go to NY we go to Little Italy to eat. Always want to try someplace different. Big mistake. Tried 3 other places. Nowhere has even compared. The stuffed artichoke is amazing. The bread with the olive oil dip I could eat all day. The pasta Alla Da Gennaro (might be the wrong name but it has that in the title) is something I could eat everyday. I will always eat there everytime I go back. FAST service too!
Alyssa P.,/user_details?userid=pIK03pFWRdCPtfzo0KP5hg,"Kitchener, Canada",12/8/2011,5,"I loved this place, this was my first and only timy in Little Italy and I went during San Gennaro and what an excellent choice, the food was amazing. At first I was a little disappointed because we had been planning to attend San Gennaro for several months and we were all looking forward to trying several different snacks from many different restaurants and as soon as we got off the subway at Canal St. it was pouring rain so we headed for a restuarant with shelter. It's truely the only Italian restuarant food I've ever had as good as my Nana makes. I tasted a little off everyones dish and they were all really amazing. Between my family and I we had the gnocchi, cheese tortellini, chicken parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs and everything was so good. I would say the best of all was the gnocchi, but it was all great. I loved the traditional bread and olive oil to start. The food and the service were great and the cute Italian guys outside directing us in weren't too bad to look at either! :) I would highly recommend this restaurant."
John M.,/user_details?userid=WKtMYautIq7r0jdZFs2fjA,"Manhattan, NY",7/28/2012,5,The chicken parmigiana is to die for. Go there and get it. You won't be dissapointed.
Radhi R.,/user_details?userid=0NPCPK9489K_CEv2qt2VrQ,"Potomac, MD",9/23/2013,1,"Horrible Horrible!! Service was terrible, food was just average, mussels were not cooked at all. The waiter was rushing us. We asked for water about 5 times and they finally brought it to us 5 mins after the food was already served!!! To top it off, the guy pouring the water was filling the glasses up only 1/4 level?? Was confused, we left promising never to go back. Little Italy has too many other good places to waste your time and money at this restaurant. VERY disappointed and more upset that I wasted my money at this place. HORRIBLE SERVICE and ATTITUDE."
Don B.,/user_details?userid=yOUxIqw3QcpdesANFz0aPA,"College Park, MD",9/5/2013,1,"DO NOT EAT HERE! I can cook better Italian food out of a box than the meals prepared in this kitchen. The first basket of bread was stale. The service is terrible. We had to ask several times for items to be brought to the table. I asked the waiter if I had done something to be treated so poorly. He just looked at me and walked away. The manager just smiled when I told him that De Gennaro was on my list of worst restaurants. I wrote ""NO TIP"" on the gratuity line."

I was visiting from Washington, DC and was spending an afternoon walking through Manhattan. I wanted to have lunch in Little Italy but had no idea where to go. I walked up to Da Gennaro (with Bella my small Yorkshire Terrier in her just purchased carrying bag) and asked if I could sit outside with her. The Maitre d' immediately said, ""of course"" and gave me a great table for 2 and I was able to place Bella on the other chair.  The service was fantastic, polite, and professional.  The food was perfect.  I was looking for spaghetti and meatballs and had that.

Rob C.,/user_details?userid=P_83pyiRNfwcX5QqntK3Ow,"New York, NY",6/5/2021,5,Still a great spot to bike to on a beautiful Spring day. We had a delicious anchovy olive and capers pizza and a Little gem salad with zucchini & radish and sesame dressing

Marcello E.,/user_details?userid=Z1FNilu7-rAslBnJlFqt-A,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",9/11/2021,1,The place has huge potential but it's really not as good as the reviews make it to be. I've gone twice and in both visits the pizza topings were uncooked. In both visits the place was severely unstaffed which created long waiting periods even though the place is packed with guests coming for dinner. It's not the employees fault they're trying to do their best with what they've got
B G.,/user_details?userid=lIjaTkw7KrPYCCOOzAf-jQ,"Racquet Club West, Palm Springs, CA",10/9/2022,3,"food was quite good but service left a lot to be desired, 20+ minute wait from asking for the check to receiving, then they lost my card for ~10 minutes, so about 30 minutes for what should have been a 3 minute process max"

Nice cold draft beer (in a real pint glass - seemingly a rare find when dining in the street during COVID restrictions). Very friendly staff who insisted I order the Calabrese pizza with a good Italian pronunciation, I appreciated that. Service got a little slow when the crowd picked up but you gotta cut them some slack during COVID. There weren't many servers and one of them got stuck at the register taking takeout orders.  If we didn't have somewhere to be after our meal, it would have been fine. All that being said, I would definitely go back. It's worth going out of your way to explore Red Hook and eat delicious food before or after a stroll on the pier. I'll take this over [BK Crab] any day."

As if red Hook was not enough off the beaten path as is, this new addition to Red Hook is off the beaten path in remote red hook! Located closer to the water and off ""the main drag"" of van brunt streets restaurants and galleries, it is adorned with street art in the exterior on Ferris st, and a rustic vibe inside. There is a large full bar, and leather couches for lounging, but a pretty limited menu. They have some fancy-ish pizzas, a few sandwiches and salads, and some dessert options. Went for my husbands bday for the first time with his parents, who seemed disappointed about the limited menu selections. I think they were looking for some pastas, and ""normal"" pizza. The special pizza of the day was 4 cheese, which e bday boy opted for. Interesting.... not sure what kind of cheese, but the dominant flavor was def not mozzarella! It was a quite strong tasting cheese, and also topped with sautéed spinach and grape tomato halves. The toppings were fine, for us, but not mentioned at all... it was a surprise. The strong tasting pizza cheese made it taste kinda rich. I don't know if I'd reorder. Myself and father in law got the meatball hoagie- I had heard thru the grapevine that the meatballs were ""amazing""-- they were ok, not doing cartwheels over them. Th e ""hoagie"" was in delicious bread, but def not hoagie style--more like a panini. I enjoyed mine for th e most part, and FIL seemed un-impressed. Lastly MIL got a special, pumpkin ravioli, which she claimed were good, but judging how much she (didn't) eat, she may have just been being nice. Bottom line, I had a nice time, enjoyed the space, and the food was ok. I loved the atmosphere. Looks like a great place to meet friends for some drinks. I think the in laws were seeking some more traditional type Italian, and NY style pizza, and said they'll stick to Marks Pizza, the take out joint on Van Brunt."

Michael T.,/user_details?userid=2gcJ0RxWNfSKUPkeB-Y99A,"New York, NY",9/16/2019,5,"We went to HOEK in a whim because we had been sitting in the park. What a whim!! The food was delicioso! The waitress (owner?) told us the jersey tomatoes were not great so we should get the bruschetta with tuna. (It's not on the menu but she had it for lunch.) she was right! We ordered the zucchini pizza with fior de latte and I loved it! I expected zucchini slices like most pizza places use but HOEK gave us long, thin curlies that looked just like the red onions also in the pizza. Great look and taste! The anchovy pizza was also great. (Look out for the garlic salt on the table! We thought it was Parmesan and ruined the anchovy pizza. Luckily, it seems to have happened before and they brought us a fresh pizza.) It seems like the wait staff go where they're needed (ie: we did not have one attendant, we had them all). It was a little confusing at first but worked out fine. If you're ever in Louis Valentina Jr Park for a sunset make sure you go for a pizza at HOEK afterwards. Oh, a Cream Ale and a shot for $8 happy hour!"

Holly G.,/user_details?userid=W7ZsaxdobHL0ypizukHw3g,"Brooklyn, NY",9/23/2019,2,Pizza is mediocre at best. Service is terrible - very chaotic and they had some mixups in the order. It took a long time for them to send out the correct order so my kids were starving by the time their food came out. And then they tried to double charge us and got defensive and pushed back when we asked them to correct the bill. Giving 2 stars because the appetizers were ok. I would not go back.

That said, I won't go back except to order takeout, then stand outside-- because of the outrageously loud music. I'm the third person so far among neighbors who agree. I am begging the owners to dampen these dangerous decibels, which will hurt your ears and those of your staff and customers. You're the closest restaurant to the quiet waterfront in Red Hook on perhaps the quietest corner in NYC, and yet you've brought this blaring Manhattan club music to it. Your fantastic, delish place is not called Hoek-Up, so please ditch the meat-market music. How about getting known as a quiet restaurant, where people can actually have a conversation above soft music?"
Eva S.,/user_details?userid=HvZCUxDFv_7-jart02zEqQ,"New York, NY",9/21/2019,1,"Horrible experience. The owner is an emotional wreck.

If the wait staff made a mistake the first place you start investigating is within your own team, not your customers on their birthday! So unethical!"

We were in a group of four and we arrived around 12pm on Saturday. The restaurant had just opened but they were welcoming and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. The server took great care to explain all the menu items to us and make recommendations, as none of had been there before. I started with the fig/goat cheese/speck bruschetta and it was AMAZING! They bake the bread from scratch and it is served warm and toasty. All my friends loved it as well. I then ordered the Fior Di Latte pizza which was a wonderful, cheesy margarita style pizza. It was made from scratch and baked in the fire burning oven that serves as the centerpiece for the restaurant. The pizza is charred to add to the amazing flavor. I am a serious pizza lover (being from New York!) and I have tried many places, this is one of the absolute best!!! They also serve local sodas and craft beers to add the perfect complement to your meal. Highly recommend, will definitely be returning."

The pizza is really good and clearly made with high-quality ingredients.  I really enjoyed it and think its worth a try. The service, however, was a bit slow. Workers were also bringing in wood and they had to leave the door open for a large portion of our meal.  It was freezing(about 20 degrees) and we were sitting right near the door. Honestly didn't seem like the right time to be doing wood loading work, and it was a bit annoying. Despite this, I will still return, as the opening of a restaurant always creates some mishaps.

Arshia V.,/user_details?userid=vCoTN9nnOjVakVGfddlxzQ,"New York, NY",9/22/2019,1,"I would NEVER want anyone to go through what we went through last night. We were huge party of professionals having a great time but none of our pizzas were coming out. The servers were pretty nice and then all of a sudden this monster of an owner (extremely rude, not hospitable at all) came out because they were getting everything wrong. We weren't sending anything back either we just wanted food that we could eat. 90% of us were vegan/vegetarian and this owner tells us all pies were served and calls the cops on us. Almost a $700 tab and we went home hungry escorted by the police!!!!!!!  (Forced to pay or we get arrested!) Who does that? How embarrassing? Every single one of us at the party were capable of covering the tab ourselves, we were still waiting for pies and the cops show up telling us the complaint was we were disruptive the entire time and were refusing to pay the bill. None of that happened! We were still waiting to eat. The entire party was sober also because they didnt even come around to take drink orders. Wow!! We were predominantly a party of COLOR and this was clearly a HATE Crime... I have never felt so violated and never thought I would be a victim of one either. Please do not support this restaurant! If there were 0 or Negative star rating I would gladly give that."
Elizabeth S.,/user_details?userid=ZFtkaCNOkG1ceCYB_pbalQ,"Brooklyn, NY",9/25/2019,1,"I'm still baffled and upset by our interaction here on Saturday night. I was with a birthday party of professional folks, and the staff was friendly enough. A pizza we hadn't ordered came (and then was taken away), and the vegetarian ones we had ordered did not. We weren't rowdy- a crowd of professionals trying to get fed, chatting to each other. I suddenly hear a loud voice say 'Well I'd prefer if you just left' to two of my friends across the table. They had asked for the whereabouts of the pizzas. The owner had come over and immediately escalated this situation, yelling. She then brought the bill over (we had asked for the missing pizzas to go) and told us to take off anything that we hadn't ordered, still without bringing the veggie pizzas. One of our party took the bill and was verifying what had come- we were a large group and they are a new restaurant and, sure, that can get confusing. So we were (quietly) doing this when I saw flashing lights out the window. And seven cops came in. Apparently while she told us to make sure the bill was correct, she also called the police and claimed we were refusing to pay. We weren't. She then proceeded to yell some more at those of us who tried to pay (the un-resolved) bill, in front of the police. I don't know what she was thinking- she initially only yelled at the brown members of our party, so there's that. But the end result was possible racism, and theft- using the cops to make us pay for something we didn't get. Please take your business elsewhere."

I didn't get any photos of the food because I inhaled it so quickly. I will be thinking about the anchovy butter carrots for the rest of my life. The wine selection is also really amazing.

The roasted tomatoes were ok.  The empanadas were good. Pork belly was good.  And the Rib eye was just ok. It was a pleasurable dinning experience.  Not sure if I would go back
Xiaowei W.,/user_details?userid=J5JFGk0xF67-7usZIUPcLQ,"Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY",12/15/2022,5,"It's Colombian owned but the food style is European-esque, reminds of places in Basque Country. The burrata in squid ink leek sauce is amazing, I don't see anywhere is doing it in the city."

Natasha N.,/user_details?userid=iPMWuk86thWCSSRYF0Drsw,"Rego Park, NY",9/21/2021,1,I would never come back to this place everything over price for greasy and test less food very bad experience and sick after that
Elizabeth P.,/user_details?userid=lGK9O4mERFJ8KrMsffLgkg,"Englishtown, NJ",3/8/2022,5,"absolutely delicious! they have this sauce that you can put on any of their dishes which was to die for (i'd love the recipe!). their chicharron was perfectly crisp and the wagyu brisket was amazing as well. for dessert, id recommend the panna cotta. servers were pleasant and so patient with all our questions"
Janet Z.,/user_details?userid=gzILMpu4yfCknUBccTHSgQ,"Dayton, South Brunswick Township, NJ",2/18/2022,5,"Super cute vibe with poster (keith herring poster!) and a bar. We ordered the empanaditas, yucca fries, wagyu brisket, and panna cotta. Everything was delicious and cooked amazingly and the service was friendly! The taste of the papardelle was so good and the texture of the yucca fries was crispy outside and soft inside. The panna cotta was amazing and smooth. Honestly everything was good and I'm definitely going back"
Quan T.,/user_details?userid=Se31HDxwz076579xZAUurQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/24/2021,5,"Probably one of the hippest restaurants in Brooklyn! I'm so glad I found this little gem in my neighborhood. The food is amazing and the servers  were super friendly. I also love the vibe here, romantic and also family friendly at the same time. We got four dishes here (three apps and 1 main dish to share) and it was more than enough for two! The empanditas and the Spanish rice were amazing! The menu changes weekly(?) I think. It's definitely a surprise but it's always amazing so it's like an amazing surprise. Overall, 5/5! Definitely coming back!"
Gary B.,/user_details?userid=gL6hMuws_XCUAF6PjIHYww,"New York, NY",7/1/2022,1,"Came here for pride this past weekend and was debating on leaving a review. Good drinks, ok food, but the thing that turned me off was watching the chef/owner? (Unclear) yell at her staff in a front of a full crowd....it was not cute. I don't think I'll be back, seems like a toxic space."
Tanya G.,/user_details?userid=qwIhu9qDYfz-qfViYhBRPg,"New York, NY",11/8/2021,3,"Wayyyyyy overpriced for the neighborhood. Listen there is a handful of better Colombian restaurants in the area that are more economically priced. We came in because we grew up in the neighborhood and are Latinos. Don't get me wrong the food is pretty decent but the portions are crazy small for its price. I recommend coming for a happy hour because the drinks are very good and with happy hour price not bad, we split two apps ad walked somewhere else to gets tacos to fill us for the night. I also wished to see more Latin influences inside the space, but looks like your typical hipster urban outfitters deco."

Scott D.,/user_details?userid=02MnFVjN172noklzpvJpKw,"Stamford, CT",3/7/2022,3,Very nice people. Very nice place.  Food only ok. Had two dishes  - the duck egg arepa and the carrots with anchovy butter - that sounded delicious on paper but were swimming in butter - as if richness was the answer. The arepa itself was very good. The roasted carrots had a caramelized appeal.  But both drowned in a butter swimming pool. Pappardelle with brisket was ok not great. Hamburger had something weird going on. That said the place itself was warm and welcoming.

It has a great vibe and delicious selection. My partner got the burger and thought it was great, 9/10. However we were super disappointed by the duck egg. We could tell it was good quality and prepared well, but there was just way too much salt! Finishing my dish was such a battle, because I wanted to love it but the salt was too pungent. Even the yuca fries were very salty, but still somewhat bearable. We enjoyed the ambiance and good wine but I'm not sure if we'll come back."

Burger was requested medium and came out well done. Wings overcooked. You have to view menu on a chalkboard inside and then go outside and order. Waste of money. Did not enjoy.

As a vegetarian, this is a place not to go. I am not strict, but the only thing to order is arepas. The menu is on the wall and is not descriptive at all. For example it doesn't say that collard greens are cooked with pork belly. My friend ordered a burger medium well and it was dry and burned. The wait staff was okay and deleted the greens from the bill. If you have any dietaty restrictions beware. The mixed drink was decent."
Ashley F.,/user_details?userid=yY2sYad_jQnbAhI5q4rtfw,"Hackensack, NJ",2/28/2016,4,"Me and my boyfriend decided to go around 8pm on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy but still very great service. They serve water in those wine bottles. I got a regular margarita for 8 bucks, not too strong but not weak either. Worth it for 8 bucks I guess. Came with salt and a lime. We both shared the beef empanitas appetizer. You get two empanitas for 8 bucks which I thought was a good deal considering how delicious they were. They were hard and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and the beef was super tender and not fatty. Came with a side of the cilantro based spicy dressing, yum! Then for my meal, I got the gnocchi for 21 bucks. It's expensive cause they're homemade and they were good! My boyfriend got the burger which comes with fresh mozzarella and an egg on it, for 15 bucks. Doesn't come with fries unless you pay an extra 6 bucks. The burger was amazing tho. The meat used was probably the best burger meat I have ever tasted. My boyfriend compared it to good quality steak. Probably worth trying. It was very dense meat and I found it filling. The atmosphere there is dim lit and the tables come with a candle. Nice date place too!"
Max C.,/user_details?userid=9KOmeIHjaRGobyN9UtWVnw,"New York, NY",2/20/2018,3,"Beautiful space with great service, but the food is not as good as it should be for the price. The menu is scribbled on a giant chalkboard (that is hard to make out from your seat) which leads to you getting certain items suggested and explained in detail. Handheld menus would help a lot since most of the dishes are so different and complex. We had the shrimp in broth (which was good but under seasoned), the burrata in squid ink (which was very messy and also begging for some salt and pepper) and finally the gnocchi which was good. Drinks were solid but also very expensive. Bill for two was $140 and we were still hungry with a nice aftertaste... not a total bust but borderline"

Karolena G.,/user_details?userid=v9rib_wI51rKHTzHOgis9Q,"Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY",9/24/2017,4,Maite was great! We ordered the rack of lamb and the monk fish. There were great flavors in all of it. The burrata in squid ink and the pork belly were also very tasty. No menu which is a little annoying but the menu changes a lot because they use seasonal  ingredients. I took away a star because it was so hot in there! No air conditioning.
Tanya D.,/user_details?userid=_HOwzo1k46HBogCUgED8XQ,"Brooklyn, NY",12/6/2015,4,"Probably  could be a five star place, but I think my tastes are a bit too pedestrian  to get the most out of this place. I got the burger, which I loved in theory. When I sliced into the egg on top and the yolk ran all over the meat I thought I saw god. And they use steak trimmings in it, so it's not your average burger. But alas, my love for the simple perfection that is the burger  at Onderdonk  and sons is unwavering.  (And about half the price!) Nice atmosphere  though, good servers, and you can tell they use high quality ingredients  and put thought into their dishes. I'd be interested in trying the lamb, fish, or maybe pasta. Not a fan of the menu only being on a chalk board though, I like one in print, but I get that they are trying to emphasize that they use fresh, seasonal ingredients that change often."

Casey D.,/user_details?userid=95NVR1Ld31h_Xs7_VJcBHg,"Manhattan, NY",6/2/2019,3,"I loved the food at Maite, the duck egg arepitas and yuca fries are must-haves. My one and pretty major complaint is that because they have a rotating menu, the only menu displayed is on a chalkboard which is hard even for someone with 20/20 vision to see. I'm legally blind and it was absolutely impossible for me to see the chalkboard menu, I told this to the waitress who very kindly read out the menu to me, but I really think they should at the very least provide a print out menu. It's a very easy and simple fix for people with disabilities or people with limited vision. I really hope that Maite makes changes to make their restaurant more accessible, inclusive and disability friendly."

Don't bother coming here if you're looking for a quick dinner of mediocre food. You might have to wait a bit for the food to arrive, but that's because it's all freshly made to perfection. Enjoy one of their RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS cocktails while you wait. And try their cheese plate too. It's not to be passed up. I ordered the gnocchi and my mind was blown. Just... just try everything. Seriously. You can't go wrong here."
William L.,/user_details?userid=zfpXytjimCnP0b6tiuOWrg,"Melbourne, Australia",4/29/2018,1,"Not very impressed. The restaurant looks nice but the food is basic and overpriced. The pork belly is a substandard cut as it is 80% fat and comes on a plate with a hot sauce but nothing else. The burger is a basic burger with only bun, meat, cheese and an egg which was totally unseasoned. The only greens we could get was a watercress salad. We were complementary of the fries though. Drinks were expensive - $9 for a small beer and $15 for a glass of wine which was nice but at a price you would expect in a wine bar in Chelsea! Nice ambience but until they can construct a balanced dish at a reasonable price I would give this one a miss!"

After a long day yesterday we came across Maite and gave it a try. WHAT A GOOD CHOICE! I had the burger, and my Hubby had the Shrimp. My Burger was cooked perfectly and was delicious. Nice Ribeye patty with a crispy fried duck egg on top ( new one on me but LOVED IT.) Seasoned very well. Hubby got 4 huge Prawns with melted scape butter. Of course I had a bite and it was soooo good. We had some refreshing libations too off of a really cool specialty drink board. I think they were called Kikos??? A sparkling Rose with grapes, went down real smooth.The prices were not bad at all, and it was a cool atmosphere with really good music playing. If we are ever back in the area we will definitely return. Had lots of tasty looking things on the menu, and the service was quite pleasant!"
Barbara S.,/user_details?userid=HB4KQasFvtCJwTyBvsEroQ,"New York, NY",9/12/2016,5,Amazing tapas and amazing drinks. Staff is super sweet. My friend and I came in here on a Monday night and it was surprisingly still serving food until close. We shared toasted bread and some amazing eggplants. V good. I recommend.

(not even the wine selection, I tried 2 wines). The char on the burger was overwhelming, bitter taste all the way through on a medium cook, my fiance had a mid-rare burger and said the same. I find that in newly hip neighborhoods, with high populations of transplants and hipsters, any dining experience that is remotely ethnic (this: Colombian fusion) gets high marks even if they're painfully mediocre. This was one of them. That said, nice servers and ambiance. But it's about the food, and it was just bleh."
Micaela C.,/user_details?userid=iJx1_u6q85t_9LJcSfW2Hw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",8/7/2018,5,"This has become our favorite new ""splurge"" spot in Bushwick. The ambience is super cozy and kind of romantic, drinks are entirely too pricy but they do offer fresh and creative twists on classic cocktails. (When are folks gonna learn, if you have a $7.00 option for wine or beer I'll have three. If it's $9.00 or more per drink I'm only ever going to have one) The food is absolutely delectable! From what I can surmise, the menu changes based on what's in season. Most plates are meant to be shared so that is what we do! Our most recent visit was this past Sunday August 5th. We sat at the bar. The bartender was basically perfect at his job. Friendly and welcoming. Informative and charming. We got the Empanadas (incredible) the cheese and zucchini in truffle oil and on the bartender's (spot on) recommendation, we ordered some toasted garlic rubbed bread to build the most insane tartines ever! We had the shrimp and Spanish rice. This was really good, the only note was the shrimp was a touch on the ""fishy"" side but I'd probably never have noticed except that everything else was so very superb.  Finally we split the burger with crispy egg. If your a drinker, your bill will rack up real high, real quick! But I'm gonna say it's well worth it!"
Phillip M.,/user_details?userid=PCOxJX0i4NlEceCiAdq8_w,"The Woodlands, TX",8/12/2017,4,Beautiful and relaxing environment. Great place for a date. Food was a little over priced and portioned small. Other than that I loved it & the beer.

It's never too crowded, the decor makes the atmosphere very convivial, there're very audacious when it comes to food, and bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable in their art. Great place for groups thanks to their big ""farm-style"" tables, and also great for dates thanks to a relax and intimate atmosphere."

Upside: everything tasted good with subtle flavors. Downsides: Hard to read the menu (especially depending on where you sit) as it is on a giant board in the back of the restaurant. There are no real menus. Also, it is very expensive. When we asked how big the servings were they made it sound like they were bigger than they were. But a good environment."

I liked the combination of an original Colombian feeling and some European/diverse food. Of course, the chef knows how to cook arepas, and how to combine them with international food. The maracuyá margaritas (micheladas, delicious) were really good. Very happy finding, this Colombian celebrates!"
Michael S.,/user_details?userid=dF7Lr6sVqprk_s1BCzmB6w,"Brooklyn, NY",1/3/2017,5,Great food and very helpful staff.  Interesting pairing and a large cider list.  I would highly recommend the burger.  Pricey but worth it.
Jill S.,/user_details?userid=kbSFYwXSj6nsCvOtDYb_Gw,"Los Angeles, CA",9/4/2015,5,"We were a large family group so we had the opportunity to sample multiple dishes.  What stood out for me were the empanditas, the burrata, the gnocchi and the steak.  The restaurant has a lovely ambiance, the wait staff was attentive and happy, and the food was delicious.  What more can you ask for in a restaurant?  I will definitely dine there again."

Kelvin C.,/user_details?userid=PenJmVOR3YnWGfWWepUzqw,"New York, NY",4/8/2015,5,This is a hidden gem.  You can easily walk by this place and not really notice it from the exterior sign but when you walk in you are amaze of how big and open the place is.  The decor is really cool and the restaurant has good background music playing.  The food here was really delicious and the staff was polite and helpful.  I am definitely going back to eat here again or even sit at the bar and grab a couple of drinks.  It is family friendly and is definitely a great date night kind of place.
Spencer N.,/user_details?userid=4d22XaYASALkK4f4eVZMjA,"Manhattan, NY",4/6/2016,2,Staff is cool. Not worth the price by any means. Got the gnocchi and a beer. With tip I spent 40 bucks. Gnocchi was pretty bland.

Keep on keepin on Maite."
Glenn P.,/user_details?userid=58DeY5jIDrpSrgjfFBJ70w,"Manhattan, NY",4/21/2015,5,"This place is perfect for for dinner. There are incredible small plates here which I love so we can try a lot of things. We had the empenaditas, the beets plate, polenta cowries, which I've never even heard of before, and the Bucatini pasta which I loved! They have a great selection of drinks and a very knowledgable staff. There menu changes slightly all the time, so definitely worth checking out regularly."

This comes at a price--not a steal in terms of item pricing/size. However, the cooking is superb; menu changes frequently (depending on environmental accessibility) with lots of unique options, sprinkled with some simpler staples. Definitely ask your server for recommended dishes. The staff is quite friendly, helpful and dare I say, attractive...  for those passionate about food or the environment, this quaintly rustic ""tapas"" place may be for you"

Carla H.,/user_details?userid=NBMs8jmPj9typk9frar9_Q,"Santa Monica, CA",7/9/2015,5,"I was visiting friends in BK from LA and they took to to Maite, a cute neighborhood gem. There, we had some amazing cocktails and appetizers (including the pizette), and a burger I still regularly think about. It's a fun, lively atmosphere filled with locals, we chatted up the table next to us and had such a great time! The staff was super nice. The food is well-prepared and the menu was almost too good (it was hard to choose!) And the chef is a female which is obviously awesome b/c you know, FEMINISM. I will definitely be back on my next trip to NY!"

This is Bushwick's best new restaurant.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic meal cooked to perfection, or a fun place to grab a drink (nice dim lighting that's perfect for a date!!!)."
Jessica M.,/user_details?userid=rfYiphKnPzSruYN6GJn3sA,"Staten Island, NY",11/11/2015,5,"Maite...very unassuming corner restaurant with supermarket written across the signage out front.

Maite thus far has been the only place with the level of sophistication I was hoping I'd come across. Yes the price points are higher than most of the other restaurants, yes the chalk board menu does not help if you're with a large group or older folks ( hey gotta take mom and pops somewhere when they come to visit ) perhaps the gnocchi was too small of a portion for some other reviewer. ....but as someone who worked in hospitality for 15 years can attest to....those deliciously  overly plump little mixtures of cheese and potato? Dough were beyond perfect and soft with coli flower that's charred just right swimming in a pool of some kind of stock, wine? and shallot sauce was absolutely fine for my fat ass.  I am not wealthy...but if you can drop as much money as these kids do on drugs and booze around here you could enjoy a very well thought out and executed meal every now and then.   Support the uniqueness of all the different venues in the area and if you don't like it move on to the next!  God knows there is plenty to go around."
Eric M.,/user_details?userid=a7WkJGzoEHbb7TLCsS1gcw,"Brooklyn, NY",5/2/2016,5,"Really excellent meal, excellent cocktails. One of the best meals I've had in NYC in the past few years. Dishes that sounded basic--e.g., asparagus, apple, and mint salad--were unbelievably interesting (and delicious)."
C O.,/user_details?userid=bu9b_ebmSSd-OpQwGO9jGQ,"New York, NY",3/2/2015,5,I like trying new places and the experience is not always as good as the one at Maite.  tried this place at a friend's recommendation last week and had the burger which comes with an egg on top of it.  I had every intention of sharing my meal with my friends but it was so delicious and moist (you MUST get fries) that I had to have it all by myself.  My friends ordered the filet and were in agreement that it was the best steak they've ever had. The wine is priced very well and a wide variety of appetizers (MUST try empanadas) make it a satisfying experience without breaking the bank.  I will be coming back to try the rest of the menu. Thanks Maite for this delicious gem.
Kate F.,/user_details?userid=vh7eMVPA4jA8kQ4a7gZcxQ,"Manhattan, NY",3/1/2015,5,SO excited that this place has opened up so close to our house. Wandered in here for dinner and had the best meal I've had in a long time. The pappardelle with rib and escarole is incredible. The atmosphere and so welcoming as is the staff. Please frequent this establishment!
Catherine D.,/user_details?userid=GPCiNXydvOzftFh9z0cDCw,"Brooklyn, NY",2/25/2015,5,"Came here for dinner, but fell in love with the atmosphere and food. Great vibe and great menu with the perfect amount of options. Get. The. Burger. There is a 'crispy egg' involved... Also the coques are incredible - trust. Glad to have this new addition in the neighborhood!"
J N.,/user_details?userid=yOvA0ypSCM-dMjTOXxB2Hg,"New York, NY",2/22/2015,5,"Discovered this little gem yesterday and what a great find it was!  Such a cute neighborhood spot and the food was amazing.  We had the brussel sprouts & empanada appetizers, which were so good and the parpadelle with pork shoulder & hamburger for our entrees.  The hamburger was the best i've had!  All of the food was farm to table with super sophisticated flavors, for a great price.  This will definitely become a regular spot for us!"
Haley C.,/user_details?userid=PyynOG-iAXpHuOg0IyBoBg,"Brooklyn, NY",12/31/2015,5,"The food here is AMAZING.  The menu changes every day, so you can always expect a new variety. The meats are top notch. The portions although small, are very filling. I would highly recommend!!"

Jody P.,/user_details?userid=Hb964iPLKmjRdSBJ_0mAow,"New York, NY",3/19/2016,4,Outstanding and flavorful food. The swordfish was delicious as was the grilled avocado and fennel. The atmosphere was warm and charming.
Nana K.,/user_details?userid=_ixnQOSLTT4_uZFP5YxrKA,"Manhattan, NY",1/8/2016,5,"Cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. They don't have a big fixed menu but instead they write special plates on the board that is available on the day and I think this makes the food so fresh and tasty. The gnocchi and hamburger is totally delicious. If you taste the food, you will notice how much effort they put in to find good ingredients."
Egroj Z.,/user_details?userid=7AQR73jTXuFt0YPzC2_plw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/23/2016,2,"I wanted to love this place since it's across the street from me but it was just ok. The burger was tasty but didn't make up for all the other things. The price and service were my two biggest issues. I just don't think the food was worth it. $15 for just a burger + $6 for the worst basket of fries I've ever had. Seemed like it was time to change the frying oil or something. Everyone at my table thought their food was pretty good it was just so overpriced ($30 for a small serving of halibut, $26 for 4 ""wild shrimp"") for the service and environment the restaurant provides. A restaurant charging this much for food really needs to be on point service wise and this place is not. The bartender was more attentive to our table than our waitress was and there seemed to be some drama in the kitchen and it was very apparent to everyone dining. Just not the vibe I was expecting. I walk by it all the time and it seemed so warm and inviting but when I actually got inside the energy was a little cold and frantic. Will probably give it another shot since I have to look at it out my windows every day."
Andrew B.,/user_details?userid=QHH-t8E09JsTqqWi7qMxJQ,"New Canaan, CT",10/8/2016,2,"I have waited a long time to eat here. I live out of town and had read all the positive reviews and was excited by the expectation of a great evening. My daughter and I sat at the bar and ordered two small beers for $9.00 each....over priced in my view. We then ordered the Halibut for my daughter which to be fair was very good. I ordered a hamburger and about 5 mins later asked if it came with anything........no......so proceeded to order fries to go with it. Probably a good idea to convey the fact that the burger comes with nothing when ordering. The hamburger (also quite small on a non descript bun) is $15 and now they want me to spend another $6 for fries....hmmmmmm. The fries were then brought to us 5 minutes later without the burger which showed up about 15 minutes later. I don't undertand the issues that evening, there were about 3 tables occupied, many staff members standing around talking and a huge disconnect with the customer. This restaurant has all the ingredients of being a home run in my view but overpriced for its location and not organized. Not a great experience."
Sarah L.,/user_details?userid=c3Gm_JD9LsNyGDvU5yNerw,"New Haven, CT",7/14/2015,5,"We arrived on Sunday, after a long and well intoxicated wedding weekend. We were a large group and hungrily hungover, to say the least. The restaurant was perfectly pleasing to the eye, with wide open windows, soothing colors, and rustic wood, mingling perfectly with a unique Buschwick edge. Our table was long but intimate, and our server was right there when we needed him, memorizing myriad appetizers, entrees, and drinks without missing a beat. But the food...oh the food! So fresh we could taste the land, and so diverse we had to order two of everything. The ribeye was my favorite, perfectly and evenly cooked, with a charred exterior and a beautiful red center, bouncing off the plate with pickled ramps and fresh, melting butter. I also recommend the empanadas, with their zesty, spicy green sauce, as well as the succulent corn and heirloom tomato with warm goat cheese! Every plate was devoured, and we all plan on coming back for more. Don't forget to try the margarita. Perfect amount of salt and sour. My new favorite restaurant in Brooklyn by far!"
Trinity W.,/user_details?userid=4-bSCM1cZPmI0QemmHCvKA,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",10/8/2017,5,"Cant recommend Maite enough. We went here on a lark one evening and immediately felt comfortable and at ease. Our server was attentive and friendly and between her and the chef, who we could see in the partially open kitchen, our dinner was paced perfectly.  We ordered three plates, the burrata in squid ink, the pork belly and a special ravioli with squash and sweet gulf shrimp.  The burrata was lovely, one of the smarter dishes I have had as a result of the big burrata trend of the last two years, the creaminess cut nicely with the salty rich squid ink.  The pork belly is literally a huge hunk of belly, melts in your mouth and served only with a simple and sweet slaw.  Finally the pasta, truly the star at Maite.  Beyond light and thin but flavorful handmade pasta with delicate but delicious filling.  On our second visit we also tried their gnocchi and the rabbit magliatelle, some of the best I've had in my life.  Do try the pasta and any of their Colombian specialities but you truly can't go wrong with any dish at this casual but refined restaurant."
Callie M.,/user_details?userid=OBaGavqv8Wu4jN11HNLWqQ,"Oakmont, PA",5/12/2017,2,"The gnocchi, wine and atmosphere were great. That being said, we had several missteps in service and our meal that made the entire experience very disappointing. I ordered the prawns, which on the menu were listed as being paired with beans and a ramp remoulade. It came out with beans in a pork based broth (maybe pork belly?) with no ramps at all. I am pescetarian and could not eat this, so with much effort waved the server down to tell him this and was incredibly apologetic because I hate to do that sort of thing. I explained that what I got was not what was on the menu and that I couldn't eat it. He seemed agitated but agreed to take the dish and replaced it with the gnocchi after suggesting a few things. After I got the gnocchi it was impossible to get his attention to come to our table even to get a refill on drinks. I am a server myself and understand having a full section, but most of his section had cleared out and it was apparent he was being intentionally neglectful. After all this, I was charged for the prawns and the gnocchi. I flagged him down again to tell him this and his response was, ""but you did order it, didn't you?"". It was overall an incredibly disappointing and frustrating experience that I can't even justify myself."

I wanted it all but even I know I cant have just candy for lunch.  I looked at the french market upstairs and though about buying some cookies I last had in Toulouse and looked at all of their tea.  I finally found the sandwich and salad counter and tried the Mozzarella Rapini sandwich for lunch.  The ingredients are good quality and there is a bit of a kick to the sandwich that I enjoy.  The portion size could be a little large for $13 including tax."

Nestled by the water, Tin Building was SO well done, sort of a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for foodies. While I didn't get to try any of the restaurants there, I did have a bite of the soft serve which was really creamy and had that real chocolate taste to it."

There were everything from fresh meat to fish to cheeses, vegetables. There were many sections for dining downstairs and upstairs with different themes including a vegetarian section. There were dressed up characters walking around as well as a ballerina prancing about. Upstairs we had a flatbread with sausage made like a pizza for the kiddo. It was not cheap but very delicious and high quality. I loved shopping in the section of oil, vinegar, mustard etc. I got some for Christmas presents for friends. I bought a shitake agrodolce! Downstairs we decided to get seats at the seafood bar, we tried oysters, sashimi, etc  everything was of superb and fresh quality. Loved it. I had a Kyoto beer it was delish! Of course we checked the candy section and kiddo got some gummy candies that were very fruity!"

Michelle L.,/user_details?userid=IBMI3FEp1qW_PbPlIsB2cA,"Brooklyn, NY",1/9/2023,2,The vibe is really nice and I love that there are good vegan options including an entire vegan restaurant on the second floor. I'm disappointed in the amount of single use waste produced by almost every transaction whether it's packaging or disposable cutlery and coffee cups. I tried to use my reusable coffee cup and was rather rudely refused. Eating my $10 cupcake (with tax and tip) with a dinky fork also felt disjointed. Sustainability is important to me and there's a lot of measures that can be implemented that will also save money. Just saying.

Jean-Georges know how to create something incredible. It's an experience. From the moment you walk on, your jaw will drop. Two floors of top notch food, drinks, and shopping. There is a cuisine for everyone and desserts galore! Feel inspired, shop for some JG spices, cookbook and fresh foods. Go whip up a dish at home. Sit outside and enjoy the breeze of the east river. People watch with an espresso or custom salad. Head inside for upscale dining or relax with tacos and a craft beer. Endless options. Go hungry and explore!"
Corie A.,/user_details?userid=K4Bri0hjX1VmXMz6oIBYTw,"Manhattan, NY",3/31/2023,1,"In one word:  overrated.  The food quality is sub-par, the vibe is mediocre and the prices are absurd for what they're selling.  This place is only good at one thing: marketing.  They did a great job marketing the Tin Building and I was so excited to check it out and eat there and then I was wildly disappointed.  They cater to people who are not real foodies and don't understand that over-pricing crap doesn't make it not crap.  I couldn't have been more disappointed with the food.  It's literal crud and the farm to table adverts are nonsense.  Maybe farm to processing plant to warehouse to warehouse #2 to back alley to storage room to vat of butter to deep fryer, I guess.  The hoopla about sustainability is also so misplaced.  They give out, advertise and market with all these laminated postcards (laminated paper is NOT recyclable and puts harmful micro plastics into the environment) and they seem to use PFAS-full cutlery and to-go containers.  If you have a kid with a good science program at her or his school, take some of their to-go boxes to the lab and test them out.  If you don't know what PFAS are, that's worth a google search.  They serve foie gras, which was illegal because of animal cruelty issues until it ended up in legal limbo based on the duck slaughterhouses' lobbying, and which is hardly ""sustainable"" or ""ethical.""  They use these catch phrase words that sound nice but there is no substance behind them at The Tin Building.  For the wise consumer and the true foodie, this is an epic fail.  For those who don't know any better, you could go ahead and order the diabetes covered in butter or you could do your research and avoid this place."

Besides the amazing food and coffee, the atmosphere of the Tin Building -- both the decor inside and the seating outside -- is really fun. It is usually VERY busy on Sundays, so be prepared to fight some crowds, but it is worth it once you sit outside with coffee and croissant in hand!

Seby I.,/user_details?userid=MM-MlSJqR1VnaWr5kSqyxg,"Manhattan, NY",12/20/2022,5,"The Tin Building is a French treasure at South Street Seaport. It is a food hall and market place all rolled into one. The perfume of the flowers in the center permeates the whole area and gives a happy ambiance. Here the service everywhere is courteous, professional and friendly. There are several restaurants, a cafe, patisserie with superb croissants and viennoiseries. My current favorite is the custard Danish. A variety of delectable cookies like cannele, both vanilla and chocolate and decadent cakes are tempting. Bûche de Noel for Christmas is also available now. There is a chocolate store selling a variety of artisanal bars and lollipops that are irresistible. Prepared foods are tempting along with a variety of French cheeses. Today was my third visit. I lunched at The House of the Rising Sun on black bean spare ribs and vegetable spring rolls with tofu skin. The ribs were tender and the spring rolls unusually yummy. Dessert of mango sago pudding was heavenly with the pudding, mango sorbet and thinly sliced fresh mango resembling a rose. I have eaten sushi at the Japanese restaurant and moules frites at T. Brasserie, the French restaurant. My plan is to eat at every restaurant and then start all over again. I always leave with a few treats from the patisserie and dream about my next visit. Jean Georges Vongerichten has created a beautiful masterpiece that all should enjoy. I know that I do!"

My favorite thing was the truffle pizza. It is on the pricier side but you get what you pay for."

From the moment that you enter until when you leave because you have eaten all of the things. All. Of. The. Things. You are are in for a treat on multiple levels.  One is that the service is absolutely impeccable and hyper responsive to needs. The food is just as though you have stepped out of NYC and into Paris and I dare you to not understand that butter and creme are staples in any relationship.  But the topping on the cake and having Jean-George show you the speakeasy himself and be so warm, friendly, approachable, and knowledgeable about every single aspect of Tin Building.  It is a labor of love and yes, you are already in love with the visual feast and gastronomic leveling of your understanding of what love on a plate feels like.... oui. Just oui. And yes, take the spot at a bar of it is open. Why wait if you don't have to."
Brad B.,/user_details?userid=MWlWUQBHv7jbxhnay6UCQQ,"Manhattan, NY",8/20/2022,5,The tin building is a culinary explosion of variety and tastes that are amazing. The building itself on the inside is spectacular from beautiful Butcher to seafood to specialty cheeses. The restaurants were packed we ate at two of them first was the sushi restaurant Shikku i'm at sashimi guy and everything was fantastic the service is impeccable my friend is a roll guy and said the two rolls the tuna and the yellowtail was incredible . The avocado seaweed was delicious even the dessert was amazing. Then we went upstairs to the Chinese speakeasy which is behind the Mercantile room spectacular decor comfortable seats impeccable service we had the black bass scallions and ginger absolutely spectacular the drinks were unique and delicious.  Jean  Georges and Howard Hughes has hit a home run the place was mobbed. This will now be a major destination for tourists from all over the world no doubt so get here quick before it's too late.
Ricardo M.,/user_details?userid=Bq11TW9wjfn4HpAz2rtEtA,"New York, NY",10/1/2022,5,"Checked out this new establishment by Jean-Georges and it was perfectly executed and curated. Best way I can describe is to Expect to find ordinary items you're familiar with but presented in out of the ordinary, special flavors and presentations. They have something for everyone's preferences! Only thing I would dare to judge is their cheese counter, which was way smaller than I'd expect"

The skill and precision preparation were evident everywhere you look. We ate at the Brassiere restaurant and enjoyed two of the signature drinks along with a French Onion Soup and Frisée Salad, which were all enjoyable. Can't wait to go back see the Tin Building firing on all cylinders."

Jessica D.,/user_details?userid=Eh8ACvzd6HgUHjkVccQzqA,"New York, NY",8/27/2022,4,"Ahh, Jean-Georges.  I've been a fan since the 90's, when my boyfriend at the time treated me to my first chef's tasting menu at Vong in Midtown for my birthday.  Of course, Vong is no more, and I married and divorced that same boyfriend, but you, Jean-Georges, have moved on to bigger things.  MUCH bigger things, like the Tin Building.  So you can imagine my surprise, while suffering the worst brain freeze of my life from eating one of your (too sweet) strawberry banana popsicles, to turn around and come face to face with you in the flesh after all these years!  Not like you noticed me - you were too busy giving a personal tour to two of the tallest, wealthiest looking people I have ever seen in my life.  But you looked good, were very animated, and I am guessing Tin Building will be a success, so good for you!  Now go talk to the people in the deli department and tell them to work on the seasoning of the Vietnamese Chicken Salad - it definitely needed salt, or fish sauce or something, even thought it did taste bright and fresh with herbs.  And if I am in the neighborhood again, I look forward to trying some of the full service restaurants."
Anu L.,/user_details?userid=M7xbGNQsnNGZHVJxhiYu3g,"Jersey City, NJ",2/10/2023,3,"I had the skate, the fish was overproduced and covered in batter so that it was hard to taste the actual fish. Strange sides. Was expecting a fresher approach."

Jennifer H.,/user_details?userid=a8Fhifq6E7VEcUVQ8gmPfQ,"Fairfax, VA",9/18/2022,3,"I guess they're still working out the kinks?? The building is beautiful inside and out, but it's basically chaos inside with very little organization. We went on a Sunday afternoon around 3 and it was super crowded. We couldn't get a seat at one of the restaurants which is why we opted for Double Yolk. The food wasn't bad but it was nothing to write home about. They also ran out of bacon and had to go fetch? make? more-- which would've been good to know before we ordered. Not a huge deal, but I dunno, I guess I kinda had certain expectations. Check it out if you're in the area, but don't go out of your way."
Amanda E.,/user_details?userid=P72ux9nKQKtCWjCLiNoAuw,"Financial District, NY",8/12/2022,5,"We tried the dosas, tacos and soft serve. Everything was fantastic. The dosa was pretty tasty and unique.

Elizabeth F.,/user_details?userid=BHanEmdotRq4t9G2EenBsw,"New York, NY",1/8/2023,3,"Okay, live in neighborhood and have eaten at all the restaurants numerous times. the Brassiere is the best. Most amazing staff & food. The worst one was Frenchman's Dough! I'm Italian and the food is excellent. The most obnoxious thing was that they actually charge $3.00 for grated cheese for pasta of which you get 2 tablespoons in a little dish!!! Obnoxious & ridiculous, raise your prices Jean-George if you need to make more $$$$."

Since no one is buying it how long is it staying in the displays? Yeah, I'll head up to the Essex Market instead. The restaurants look nice hopefully they will adjust the prices since there is nothing at Pier 17 to eat for a reasonable price."

This place is really beautiful and the staff is both professional and well presented (lots of good looking guys). The selection of products and food is just perfect . We went on the public opening day and there were a lot of strollers  and curious people including myself taking pictures all over . I can't wait to come back and taste everything also because I live nearby and I really like walking around my hood supporting my local businesses.

Emily S.,/user_details?userid=xgU2khrxwHyhLjTEv5gl0g,"Port Washington, NY",12/3/2022,3,"This is our second visits to the Tin Building. We went there before the official opening and loved it so much we went back again. We ended up buying the wonderful croissants and danish again and the Swedish rye bread ( which was offered at the Fulton). Then we sat down at the raw bar. The oysters were still as fresh as they were on our first visit. This time, I took a bite on the delicious scallop sashimi. I need to say that I was not a fan of scallop sashimi, but the way they prepare it changed my mind on scallop sashimi! That it was sweet and fresh is expected, but the yuzu and serano combination used to dress the scallop made it so different and memorable. But I have a problem at the Brasserie. I  need to recommend that the barista be more attentive to his job, and look not to serve the drag together with the wine! That is not acceptable. Yes, they compensated me with a fresh glass, but this should not have happened! Not at a JeanGeorges' restaurant!"
Sean T.,/user_details?userid=cGmp0F062c9HT81TRz4WNA,"Camp Hill, PA",10/14/2022,5,Had lunch at bar upstairs with family and friends. Food and service was impressive considering the operation just opened.

There has got to be a better system with the people ringing us up. The first time I thought it was an honest mistake - there is no excuse for the second time. Figure it out guys!
Lauren S.,/user_details?userid=K6u20Ms6_9xLOwkI_3W4aQ,"Miami, FL",9/22/2022,5,"A must visit spot in NYC. The tin building is a food market with so much variety between the candy store, coffee shop, food and flower stand there is something for everyone. We even saw Jean Georges himself walking around, which was such a great surprise to see. Along with this it has multiple sit down restaurants. We tried House of the Red Pearl and had the most delicious Asian inspired dishes. The fried rice and dumplings were some of our favorites. The service was exceptional and overall had a great ambiance. Great addition to the Seaport, would definitely go back!"
Ronald K.,/user_details?userid=89KwHl37_08II0D9Iufo5w,"Somerset, NJ",8/25/2022,5,"Recent renovations make the Tin Building a must visit for tourists & townies alike.  The markets have excellent offerings at premium prices, although the fish were closer to reality.  I found the Mao style uniforms to be strangely out of place, but I assume that they represent someone's definition of cool chic"
Danielle P.,/user_details?userid=YlFpcjHcgvR0rhyIynN1CA,"Staten Island, NY",8/14/2022,5,"This place is amazing, but still has a few kinks to work out.  I wasn't actually be able to be seated in the French restaurant because they were booked solid and the hostess didn't seem to know how to convey that.  She said it would be an hour wait, which I would have been okay with, but it would not have been okay with the kitchen.  So she handed us menus and then a manager came over to tell us we couldn't be seated today.  It was just very awkward and the hostess should have had the sense to tell us we couldn't be seated today.  The market place is filled with beautiful imported vinegars, oils and more.  They also had some fruits and vegetables that I don't often see locally and the presentation, made it easier to pay the inflated prices.  Will definitely be going back."
Rukiya L.,/user_details?userid=8Vegpc9Ub7gFDmGmXUd66A,"Brooklyn, NY",8/26/2022,5,"I'm giving this place 5 stars!! I've been around the world and aye aye aye aye. It's the perfect mix of gourmet delish, eye candy and specialty treats. Expensive, yes, it's New York. But not like FOH you must have bumped your head expensive. It is truly an experience for all the senses. Do you love gourmand ingredients??!! I do and the Tin Building has so many. Butcher, legit! Oysters, legit!! Had some sushi rolls, nigiri and sake at Shikku. I found the restaurant very high concept and decent in execution. The seafood is exceedingly fresh, but some of the rolls were a chefs experimentation with flavors that didn't gel well. Sake selection (and I've been trained in Tokyo) was lovely and it's a great respite from the grocery and butcher. Definitely hit up the gourmet sauce/oils/kitchenware spots. Scored a gorge pair of chopsticks. Many beautifully curated and unique finds and expensive but not like WTF expensive prices. Will definitely go again to experience more bourgeois loveliness and the House of the Red Pearl."

You can order takeout at the counter or sit down to eat. I sat down and ordered the Beijing Street Noodles. The portion was honestly pretty big - lots of noodles, minced pork, and shredded cucumbers. Didn't notice the black bean sauce but overall pretty good. Overall, pretty straightforward place with nice portions and good prices for Williamsburg ($12 for this). Would definitely recommend and try the rest of their menu."
Nicole B.,/user_details?userid=e4hd3J5hDY9YnxbbXq8-Cw,"Brooklyn, NY",2/8/2023,3,"This was a nice spot in Williamsburg that i walked into. The food was okay, they have a happy hour that is pretty good. I tried the crispy chicken wings with soy garlic sauce, a mint mojito, and a scallion pancake. The wings were okay. They were crispy but the sauce didn't do it for me. I've had better soy garlic sauce. Also, you can't take the happy hour food to go. It must be eaten in the establishment which is okay. The ambiance was cool. It was a cool mixture of hip hop, pop and R&B. They have a couple tables where you can dine in. The service was just okay. The lady at the counter was busy doing other things each time we approached the counter. So it wasn't the best service. I asked a question about one of the food items and decided against it by the way she described it. It was almost as if we were disturbing her. I hate that feeling. All in all, this place was just okay. I don't think I'll return tho. I'm sure there's better bao buns down Bedford. See pics below"
Hiral P.,/user_details?userid=0Nrv9X8J_vSVoA55NmtmcQ,"New York, NY",11/22/2022,3,Very average place for dumplings. The xiao long bao wasn't amazing and I wouldn't get it here again. The curry fried rice was also ok. The service was very meh. They got annoyed because we asked for extra utensils/plates which was kinda of off putting and felt kinda cheap.
Kadeesha L.,/user_details?userid=t0yamaWKaSInp6AoVPmJZA,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",10/28/2022,4,"Mr. bao has been popping up everywhere! And this location is open late so it's perfect for a bite after a night out. Fast service, good amount if seating. Food comes out hot! The buns are chewy and soft as they should be! Check this place out for a quick bite. They also offer takeout on several platforms. My favorite is the duck bao buns. They are so chewy and soft yet a meaty- nice balance."

Omg I can have this every day,very delicious second of all the spicy noodles you have to try it,i usually door dash from here so all I have to do is shake my noodle in the container and bam  right offf with the spicy ! Hmmm the beef noodle soup love it as well but I wished they had a different type of noodle like glass noodle or a thinner noodle ,the noodles they use are to starchy and get stuck to together when put on the go container,to thick to pick up with chopsticks but over all YUMMy!"

So happy and content, the string beans are perfect never soggy ! Deff a 5 thumbs up and good packaging and sweet staff, sorry i started eating the bowlbefore the pic lol"
T T.,/user_details?userid=fRXVnYMaLpNy4EWDZGwEvg,"Brooklyn, NY",12/24/2021,1,really wanted a light meal and ordered a vegetable soup. It was super salty and impossible to drink. I have no idea where is the vegetable besides the few pieces floating on top. I paid 5 bucks for this and it is very disappointing.
Yinger P.,/user_details?userid=-ZtJL8d32tHVhFbItRYFmw,"Brooklyn, NY",10/2/2021,5,"Been there a once a while back, love all those small plates.  The place is pretty small with attentive service and good food. I  will definitely go back for more soup dumplings."
Phenpatson L.,/user_details?userid=f6Zof7wj5g7mIJCyY2Dd8Q,"New York, NY",5/17/2022,5,"This is one of my favorite Chinese dim sum restaurants in Williamsburg I've ever been to! And I've been all over the world including to China! The Chef Special was phenomenal!  The soup dumplings were top notch! I'm obsessed with the Chrysanthemum tea too. Kiki, our server was the best. She is so kind and polite. I highly recommend it"
Abigail H.,/user_details?userid=KfO8LNxjJuAeay5gtZ6Ynw,"Staten Island, NY",7/30/2022,4,Super good place I came here with my friend after we looked around. I love soup dumplings so I got the pork crab soup dumpling it was super good. It's not as the best as compared to the ones I go at China town but still great
Allie O.,/user_details?userid=h6u9p4s-2045TwcyCl-ZEQ,"New York, NY",6/25/2022,5,This place is totally on point re food and the people who work there are wonderful!!  I always enjoy the experience whether sitting in or taking out.  My personal opinion is the vegan spring rolls are tops in the neighborhood!
Josh O.,/user_details?userid=od6-_qXAS2EgM5kPr_dauA,"Manhattan, NY",11/5/2022,5,"Amazing. Best soup dumplings in Brooklyn. Had an amazing time, staff is great- I definitely recommend to anyone who is in Brooklyn to try them out"
Tristan P.,/user_details?userid=w-xhGh_nSCmoxhq-rciQIw,"New York, NY",8/21/2021,5,"Chef's dumplings, short rib guabao, roasted duck wrap should be on every single order. Don't pay attention to how it looks from the outside, the food is really really tasty."
Jean H.,/user_details?userid=xoS3ka6gEEJhNMTUs3X_5g,"Evansville, IN",11/28/2021,4,"Ordered take out. I got the create your own - jasmine rice, wild mushroom & salt & pepper shrimp. The shrimp had very good flavor. I was a little surprised by the mushroom. I was expecting something different but overall it still taste good. It reminds me of seaweed."
Clari B.,/user_details?userid=LO_uLZ2ya4VC4JSXqzSFKA,"Brooklyn, NY",2/27/2022,1,One and done. With the amount of places that serve dim sum this is not worth another try. Ordered about five different dumplings and a duck appetizer. The duck was oily and the paper wrapping was hard to distinguish. The dumpling fillings were flavorful and definitely worthy of a bit of a yummy praise however the dumpling masa (dough) was so thick and on some so mushy it was unpleasant and inedible. Overall I'd say try any of the many other spots around. (Note: my eats were pre-covid times).
Priyanka M.,/user_details?userid=rCJLUU5P8ndv2gBKEzX5Dw,"New York, NY",1/17/2022,5,"Ordered the dan dan noodles, duck wrap, and soup dumplings-- all absolutely delicious. Can't believe this place doesn't have a 5 star rating! Can't wait to try everything else."
Nicole L.,/user_details?userid=YfHI1VGOqQ45_67chdhBkg,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",11/19/2021,5,"I'm so glad I tried this place again. It's not somewhere I would dine in at, but the food is amazing. I can't get over how good the braised beef was. It was succulent and the flavor was perfect. The smashed cucumbers were also sooo good. I wanted more! I liked the option for Korean style multigrain rice. The duck roll is also awesome. It's super flavorful. I came back just for that. The chicken wings are very crisp fried Korean fried chicken style. My friend raved about the dumplings - he had pork and chive and chicken and cabbage. To me they seem standard. He couldn't tell which was which but was very happy and ate every drop. I do wish the dine in experience was better. It's definitely more of a takeout place. Oh and the customer service was great! I accidentally placed my online order to the Park Slope location, and when I called to cancel they transferred the order for me. They made it nice and easy for me, which I really appreciated. Will be back!"
Nataliya O.,/user_details?userid=FAECsJM6cSX9pYlj8oCCyA,"New York, NY",2/1/2022,5,Great fresh food. They forgot to enter one of the dishes but it turned out fine because we were pretty full by dish #3. Would definitely go back again.
Samir A.,/user_details?userid=lsJcUIk6invb0nsQeDQxNQ,"Somerville, MA",9/20/2022,5,"Fantastic spicy wontons, hot and sour soup, and duck wrap. Highly recommend late night takeout"
Jessica G.,/user_details?userid=IVhYq3z7dFDFjtHgWjkaSw,"Manhattan, NY",3/30/2022,5,Everything was bomb. The Taiwanese fried chicken wrap was my favorite. Love that they're open later than most places these days.
Gera C.,/user_details?userid=omZEMy85NZsedNT0kg0wGA,"Brooklyn, NY",3/7/2022,5,Amazing food and the lady at the register is a Doll .. I love this place .. Williamsburg does have it all
Javier M.,/user_details?userid=w--Yxpn1aM1L45-6wY-zdQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/23/2021,5,"More like Mr WOW! The food is incredible. Just take a look at the picture attached to this review. If that isn't beautiful, idk what is then. I have to say that the meat was so tender, I could just bite it off with my mouth without using utensils. I do not recommend. Less so if you are on a date. But that tells you how good that was. Maybe the rice could have been more on point but everything else was delicious."
Jessica W.,/user_details?userid=bwHKOfs4qScvV__Dc4dBIQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1/31/2022,5,"The staff is so friendly. All the food is delicious and fresh, been there several times and it has always come out really fast. A great place to go, especially if you're gluten free, they cook many dishes with tamari and the staff is knowledgeable about many allergies."

Mark D.,/user_details?userid=JlstZchKYN4isphLS90Hhg,"Brooklyn, NY",11/12/2021,1,"I guess this place is part of a chain. Basically Asian fast food. The menu looks good but we found most of it really awful. The fried calamari was so greasy. The Beijing Street noodles were awful, tasteless and gummy store bought noodles. The soup dumplings were edible, but still not recommended. The service is all plastic even if you sit at a table and order from a waiter. You can do so much better in this neighborhood! Vanessa's Dumplings is similar but WAY better. M/Shanghai has much better soup dumplings."
Chris K.,/user_details?userid=y3fwEDHwwKtFAYuCR2gZ0w,"Brooklyn, NY",9/30/2021,4,"Delivery soup dumplings are kind of a white whale and these are quite, quite good.  Cue XLB snobs saying they're not good... Yes, I know the holy grail of XLB is typically to get the thinnest skin possible, but I don't really care, and these are not too thick. Also, I'm not going to flushing or the Bao on St Marks every time I want a soup dumpling.  The crab and pork are delicious, get them. I wasn't a huge fan of the ""sandwich"" baos (including the duck others seem to like, it was glazed with too much soy/hoisin for me) or the non-soup dumplings. The best chicken dish is the sichuan (but it's not actually, it's American style kung pao/ sesame chicken with a different sauce, which is not very spicy and more sweet).  I'll try some of the other dishes, but it's called Mr Bao, so, like, I guess start with the baos right?"
Nina P.,/user_details?userid=kg4XjXN5ypfeN6aUZrudhA,"Brooklyn, NY",8/21/2021,1,"I ordered fried rice, soup dumplings, a duck roll and shumai. Nothing tasted good. Lacking flavor. The rice was specially plane"
Jazminda J.,/user_details?userid=hovxDi_uWrkAjRdndxh0fQ,"Staten Island, NY",4/17/2021,5,Food was amazing and filling. Sorry No pic I Was hungry. I ordered Pork Bao bun was fluffy and pork inside was juicy. I also got Taiwanese fried chicken bowl with vegetable fried rice & green beans delicious. Definitely check this spot out.
Loren M.,/user_details?userid=ScAU5COFrKBVT5g9JT5_Kw,"Daly City, CA",3/20/2022,1,"Popped in on a whim cause the exterior looked promising. Dumplings were good and I would order the again. However, both the noodle dishes we got(the Dan Dan and Beijing) were flavorless, watery, and the meat was like chopped cat food. Would not return."
Valerie N.,/user_details?userid=MgnVJP_0BKH902mjV-WEDw,"RI, RI",6/27/2021,5,"This place had the BEST soup dumplings we have ever had.  The staff was very nice and they got our order together pretty quickly to-go.  We got those delicious soup dumplings and some shrimp fried rice.  Both were good (especially the soup dumplings - did I mention that?), and their soy sauce was also uniquely tasty.  It had a stronger vinegar taste, which we loved.  We don't typically pour soy sauce into our rice, but we dumped it all over.  Great spot, great food.. we look forward to coming back."
Adam T.,/user_details?userid=62QmGj1KEzTQxUbkHUcDyQ,"Miami, FL",7/7/2021,2,"Kinda disappointing. Nothing we ate was really that good except the duck wrap, which was good but greasy. Even the crab soup dumplings which seemed to be the thing to get were pretty meh. The noodles we got tasted like plain pasta and the memory of them is so bad I just took another star off my rating. 2/5 stars generally, 1/5 for the genre of food."
Carly G.,/user_details?userid=T8nacPu-EEmkS5RAv5A5hQ,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",8/14/2021,5,Cute shop with affordable dumplings! The pork soup dumplings were my absolute favorite! The steamed chicken dumplings were also amazing. Really big portion sizes as well. The bao buns were incredibly fluffy. Would recommend coming with a group so you can share! Come here for a more casual lunch and most important come very hungry.
Jamila G.,/user_details?userid=ZoKCZZtSIwNWLJwIGDqqyQ,"Queens, Queens, NY",4/14/2021,5,Fairly new spot. Very cute and cozy. Love the ceiling decor. It was the first thing that caught my attention. Make sure you look up when you enter :). They have both indoor and out door available. The staff was amazing !!! It was my first time there and someone took time to help and explain everything on the menu. The food was delicious. I recommend getting the soup filled dumplings. It was more of an experience eating than anything. I would definitely recommend this location and will be back the next time I'm in the area !!
Nectar S.,/user_details?userid=9SwOjT3A4huGOwii1ra7pg,"Chicago, IL",7/3/2021,5,"Love their dumplings! My favorite are the chicken ans cabbage and their pan friend soup dumplings. Great price and texture, the dough is not too thick, good amount of filling. Their bao is perfectly chewy but soft. I've yet to try their noodle or rice bowls but will definitely come back."
Johann R.,/user_details?userid=dDo6hPDHYnGezWQJUCDqQA,"South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",5/7/2021,4,We stumbled upon this place while walking in the neighborhood and ordered out. The food is excellent especially the Short Rib and Fried Chicken Bao. The Shumai and Popcorn shrimp deserve an honorable mention. The Dan-Dan noodles were so-so! I would definitely come back here ... either do pick-up or eat-in if I was looking for a casual place to catch-up with a friend.
Rachel Shiyun C.,/user_details?userid=DhqOZ_q_33RK7JUkfCxHnA,"New York, NY",4/24/2021,5,"We ordered Mr Bao for lunch via seamless, and the food was FANTASTIC!!! We ordered the pork soup dumplings, the pan fried shrimp and pork bao, shu mai, the set of 3 baos (pork, beef, vegetable), and the sesame balls. Can I just say, the baos are SO CHEWY and the fillings are so delicious?!? As Chinese/Taiwanese, I'm all about authentic Chinese food. Mr. Bao definitely nailed the authenticity aspect and then more. The taste and texture of every food is so amazing and the looks are beautiful!!! Will definitely come back a lot more!"
Andi H.,/user_details?userid=QBg2os1Wln4crPiUspdI9Q,"Philadelphia, PA",6/20/2021,5,"I'm doing hair around here so I ordered take out. The buns are so good! My favorite one is the duck steamed bun, it tastes good even gets cold, very refreshing. The fried chicken I ordered is not that crispy since it's take out, but still juicy."
Winson W.,/user_details?userid=Frmxt99lkVjJ6OlfbXRQ_g,"San Francisco, CA",4/20/2021,5,Pretty good soup dumplings and reasonable pricing. great addition to the neighborhood.

Mays K.,/user_details?userid=crNmVN-ZGPGG73BvJqc4eg,"Austin, TX",10/3/2021,1,"The bao is really small, and it's underwhelming. The meat is really chewy and the sandwich is barely filled. Seriously a rip off! Not to mention take out took 40 minutes for one bao sandwich. I recommend going to any other place for bao."
Christopher Y.,/user_details?userid=XMaYF-uMRfuGVH6t3QlRtw,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",4/24/2021,5,"The dumplings were quite a surprise, alot better than other dumpling spot in the area."

Jenna C.,/user_details?userid=7-W1HNGHhmfjsoCnXkOM5w,"New York, NY",8/15/2022,4,"My friends and I decided to get a pre dinner cocktail at Leroy's a couple of weekends ago - sans reservation on a Saturday, we had no issue getting a table for 3 outside. The outside is super cute - I love the style of their chairs and the plants really make the space wonderful with views of the action on Franklin. The inside is equally cute and I love the bar centered within the room - makes it feel like a nice communal space to gather with local friends. All 3 of us had the Double Derby and it was perfect! Refreshing on a hot day and an amazing blend of flavors. The presentation was also beautiful and an Instagram-er's dream. My friend had a craving for the Scotch Egg so her and I split an order. Amazing! The egg was perfectly jammy and a great sized pre-dinner snack. We snuck a peak at the dinner menu and it looked incredible so we made a mental note to come back for dinner and did just that last Saturday! We made a 7:00 pm reservation for 3 a few hours prior online. We were seated inside at a table behind the bar right near the kitchen - which was neither the best nor the worst. We still got to take in the amazing decor of this spot and I loved the grouping of plants hiding in the corner near the ceiling. Minus one star for the somewhat awkward seating location and very slow to start service. My friend and I both ordered the Double Derby again and our other friend had the Last Week I Was At This Other Bar per the server's recommendation - it looked tasty! He followed that with an equally delicious espresso martini. Our first round of drinks took an incredibly long time to reach our table - we saw them sitting at the bar on a tray for a while and I was tempted to go grab them myself. When they finally arrived we immediately placed our food order to avoid further delays. The three of us split an order of 6 oysters - they were tasty but on the smaller side. I could have easily done my share of a dozen. For dinner I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich and subbed the fries for salad. My friend had had it before and said it was just good. I definitely thought it was delicious; however, having recently been to Nashville, it was nothing like the hot chicken there so manage your expectations - this sandwich was tasty in its own way! I was also impressed by how good the simple side salad was! Greens with a light dressing, it perfectly complimented the kick of the sandwich (just a kick, I would not market this as hot or spicy). One of my friends had the burger with a similarly subbed side salad, and the other had the beef tartare with a side of Brussels sprouts - I tried some sprouts and highly recommend! I believe you can't go wrong with anything on the menu here and my friends and I want to go back to order some more dishes to share - it looks perfect for that. Minus the few hiccups, I cannot wait to go back to this cozy yet chic neighborhood gem!"
Shana B.,/user_details?userid=rRAoEJg5AXZbjYB-2wKBGA,"Flatbush, New York, NY",1/24/2023,5,"Visited Leroy's over the weekend. Nice spot if you're looking to have a couple of drinks and relax. Was greeted and seated right away at the bar (we didn't have reservations, so no tables were available) . Bartender came over almost right away to offer us water and take our order. My friend had ""The Burger"" and I had their chicken sandwich (both orders came with fries). Food was delicious. I don't really care for fries, but their own were good, I ate it all. Music was good and staff was friendly. Would recommend."
Andrina S.,/user_details?userid=16PE7t_FrZQJD54Ao6WhWw,"Lower East Side, New York, NY",2/7/2023,3,"Cute place, good cocktails, but food was just ok! Service was above average. I don't know if I'll be back but worth a try."

Marianne P.,/user_details?userid=PxOTnnbIfj7X241DypYRJw,"New York, NY",7/2/2022,5,"Started with drinks to celebrate #59! Corner booth was a hit- appetizers a plenty included blistered Shishito peppers, olives, roasted cauliflower, and Brussel spouts started us off. We opted to share entrees. One couple shared the branzino and the hanger steak - so tender and NO bones. The Filipino garlic fried rice was so good- I was looking up recipes at the table. The other couple shared the ribs special on a mustard bed of coke slaw and fish beignets. The side of fries wasn't necessary!  Amaro Nonni to end a memorizable meal and chocolate chip cookies to go!  We will certainly make more trips here. You can't cook this too for yourself even with all the Covid practice. Trust me!!!  Jane, our server, steered us in the right direction with every choice!  Plus she was so welcoming and friendly- it felt like home! Don't miss out sitting I n the corner booth sipping a signature drink."
R D.,/user_details?userid=gwWJerJBURK2h_-Y-UveHQ,"New York, NY",9/3/2022,5,Delicious fresh food and super friendly. We asked for some modifications with the drinks and they were more than happy to accommodate. Nice outdoor seating as well.

Incredible cocktails, a great happy hour ($10 cocktails from 4-6pm), and amazing food. The service is also really great. Perfect for a date night, or a dinner for 4. No reservations, so get there early. By 7pm, it's bumping -- but that's because it's so dang good! They also have great music playlists and the ambiance is chill!"

Kameelah T.,/user_details?userid=j72kEgt__CciBRv1QRjn5g,"Columbia, SC",11/28/2022,5,What an amazing quaint place. It's not large but definitely accommodating. They have two outdoor seating areas in front and our back. The back area flows indoors seamlessly. The food was amazing. They had bottomless mimosas for an hour for a cheap price to add on to the meal.

Sherry S.,/user_details?userid=km992P7u9KvqvY8LOUgoig,"Brooklyn, NY",11/6/2022,4,I visited this establishment yesterday evening with family and friends. I ordered the fried calamari as my appetizer which was delicious. I had the Salerno Sunset which was good as well. For my entree I had the Chicken Sorrentino. The Chicken Sorrentino didn't wow me. There is way to much cheese in the dish and the mashed potatoes had no flavor. This is why I'm giving the review 4 stars. The server was nice. He kept refilling our water and ensured that when our plates were empty he would clear the table. I'm willing to give the restaurant another try maybe I'll attend their brunch.

The baked clams were delicious. The sangria was just wine, I ordered a sprite and poured it in to help repair it. I was looking forward to coming to this restaurant based on the pictures on Instagram. It wasn't even close to what I had imagined. The service and attentiveness were great but everything else was just average."

The portion to price does not match and could be more food for the price. We concluded that most people that gave the restaurant a 4 or 5 were tipsy from the bottomless mimosas which seem good but I don't drink so I was there for the food and not the drinks; hence, the 3 stars."

Shurida L.,/user_details?userid=o9AMDtTkautAP-LGaA-9_w,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/22/2022,4,I love that brunch is served everyday. I had the penne ala vodka with shrimp and calamari as an appetizer. The food was really good and the restaurant itself is a pretty restaurant. The only downfall was it was busy so refilling our mimosas took some time and also bottomless brunch being 60 mins sucks. I'm used to 90 mins or two hours. I do love that the mimosas and Bellinis had different flavors and we got to try most of them. I would go back to this restaurant.

Samantha M.,/user_details?userid=upV2GPOYdIy0GldCfzEofA,"Fairmount, Philadelphia, PA",2/6/2023,3,"I have been here twice before and both times the food was excellent! Both times I ordered the same thing - Breakfast Avocado Toast and a Pineapple Bellini. It was a great portion for the price, and the bottomless drinks are a great value - although I only ever ordered one drink and never ordered the bottomless. The only complaint I have about this restaurant is the service. On my first visit, I had no issues. However, on my recent visit a few days ago I was very unhappy with the service and attitude from the waiter. I ordered a Fried Egg on my avocado toast, as the menu stated you have a choice between Fried Egg, Scrambled, or Poached Egg. When he brought out my food, there were scrambled eggs on top of my avocado toast. I then informed him that I had ordered fried eggs, to which he told me that these were fried eggs because the eggs are fried. He went back and forth with me, trying to correct me that the term I was looking for was ""Sunny Side Up."" However, I am a chef so I think I know the difference between different styles of eggs. Also, a quick google search will show you that Fried Eggs are the same (also known as) Sunny Side Up - there are just two names for it. Once you scramble the yolk, the egg is no longer a traditional ""Fried Egg,"" but rather scrambled eggs, as you have scrambled them. So if what he served me wasn't scrambled eggs, but rather a Fried Egg, I am confused as to what their scrambled eggs look like. Although it may have been a simple mistake from the kitchen, it was the attitude and condescending attitude from the waiter that really turned me off. All he had to say was ""No worries, let me bring it back for you."" It is just strange to me that a waiter at a brunch restaurant seriously doesn't know what a Fried Egg is and has the nerve to correct me when a simple Google search proves him wrong. Even after showing him the Google search, he still insisted I was wrong. It was so strange to me! Next time I visit Court St I may just check out a different brunch spot, not to run into this waiter again!"
Mari T.,/user_details?userid=uqXV80FHQrl3qgb3uKBEEQ,"New York, NY",1/16/2023,4,"I went there for brunch on a Sunday at 1:30. Me and my friends had a reservation and were seated a little later, which was fine because some of us were running late. we were seated in the ""outdoor"" area which was pretty well heated and covered. I ordered Canadian eggs Benedict that came with brussels sprouts and potatoes, the brussels sprouts were OK nothing exceptional, the potatoes were good and the eggs Benedict were pretty good, not too much hollandaise sauce however, they got cold fairly quickly. I'm not sure if it was the space or just eating a bit slow. Also got the unlimited bottomless brunch which was $22 a pretty good deal and you were able to switch the drink so I started with a peach Bellini, then to a mango Bellini and I also tried a pineapple Bellini. all of them were delicious and the waiter was really on top of bringing us a new glass when we were finished. A small tip is to pay in cash so you don't get the 2-3% credit card charge."
Melissa S.,/user_details?userid=GDwGY_ssFPvUReY7H9kIug,"Newark, NJ",7/15/2022,5,Yes... okay yes to this restaurant. I don't know how I found out about it but I've had it bookmarked for quite awhile. Came in for an early dinner last Saturday and was not disappointed. We were seated on the back patio which is gorgeous and thee perfect vibe for a summer evening. They started us off with complimentary bruschetta which was yummy! We got the mussels and calamari to start..highly recommend both. The star of the show for me was the Bronzino. I was in lovee. It was grilled to absolute perfection and the flavors were insane. I highhlly recommend. If you don't mind deboning it yourself I'd go for the whole one instead of the filet. Service here was awesome too. You need to bring cash to this place though because they charge you when you pay by credit card --which I think is tacky btw. I would come back though WITH CASH!

(Pretty standard in NYC) We had a reservation and were seated almost immediately. It was around 2pm, so there were only a few other diners anyway. For the meal, I ordered the pappardelle in tomato sauce. It wasn't on the menu, however I knew they served it based on a previous post. My bf ordered the burger and fries. We also had the bottomless brunch mimosas. The food was delicious and was served in decent portion sizes. The mimosas were pretty great too lol! Definitely left there with a buzz.

Jemima L.,/user_details?userid=XGrlBv0wo-mxal10ypYF8A,"Brooklyn, NY",10/3/2021,5,Verde on Smith used to be one of my go to brunch spots a few years ago. I haven't been in a long time so when a friend mentioned she went and enjoyed it so much and asked would I like to have our next meet-up there I was more than willing. We went for a late weekday brunch and the weather was a bit meh so it was pretty empty that day. I ordered the shrimp fettuccine Alfredo and it was a nice portion with good flavors. I also ordered crème brûlée for dessert and a cappuccino. We were permitted to stay past the 90 min brunch seating time allowance as it was a slower day. We really enjoyed our meal. It's great to know that they have been a consistent staple all these years. I saw menu items I knew and loved from a few years back. Definitely a great option for brunch as they have weekday and weekend brunch. The wait service was very pleasant and helpful!

For $120 the two plates of pasta were bad. Not ok...literally unpleasant to eat. The vodka sauce was watery and flavorless, with the prevailing note being onion. The carbonara was all cream and similarly flavorless. Simply not worth it. Did not finish our plates. Additionally, it was a $10 surcharge per plate for spaghetti and penne...Went straight to Vinny's  afterwards for good food. If you're looking for bottomless Italian brunch there are many MUCH better options out there."

The vibe at the restaurant is lively -- they keep busy and it's a nice-looking, diverse Big Apple crowd. I think they have an outdoor area too but I'm a bar kinda guy and their bartender was great. I had the vegetable omelette with a side of Italian sausage (and mimosas of course) and everything was top notch. Couple months later, ordered delivery which came piping hot and tasted just as good. There are so many options for food in NYC. I'm just thankful to have run into this place, my new go-to brunch spot."

We decided to go with the boozy brunch option ($22 with an entree) while the others in the party settled on just regular brunch/dinner courses. The table behind us was excessively loud and people actually asked to be moved away because of how loud they were. All the tables were pretty crowded together. It was hard to maneuver around. We were sat in the back room.  I could barely hear the music. Also our waiter wasn't the friendliest guy, was whatever about everything. We were waiting pretty long for our last few round of drinks and then the waiter came up to me and my sister and said ""ok your time is up"" after not being seen for 15 mins. I will say the food was good. I ended up getting the chicken sandwich with fries and it came with brussle sprouts as well. Those were delicious. But the Alfredo pasta was pretty bland. I wouldn't come back here unfortunately, there are definitely better brunch options out there."

The service is exquisite!! The staff was beyond expectation.  The food was absolutely delicious.  They brought out a birthday themed dessert plate - so lovely!  We'll be back soon."

Sanskriti V.,/user_details?userid=8LHhnDcWw2-7iZQI9veedg,"New York, NY",6/5/2022,4,Amazing brunch / boozy deal. 55 for a pitcher of mimosa and two entrees. Got the smoked salmon Benedict and vegetable omelette. Quality of the food was excellent. Back yard patio was very comfortable and cute but there were flies here and there which I think could be taken care of better.
Chastity M.,/user_details?userid=Wr4Is3-ME0o6zGLVifMgsg,"Brooklyn, NY",12/18/2021,5,I had brunch here today and it was such a great experience! Our server was the best. Her name was Arita and she was fantastic. She had the best personality and was so cool from the moment we came in. She had a great personality and was good at her job overall. She made the experience great. There was also a gentleman there who was just as great but I forget his name. In addition to the excellent service. The food was so good. I had a steak eggs Benedict (for the first time) and it was so good. Also a side of French toast for the table and that was so good as well! The decor is awesome as well. We sat in the back patio area which had Christmas decor (thought that was super cute) and the inside has its own vibe. Loved it. Loved everything. Not my first time there. It's been a while but it was just as great if not better than I remember.

Austin C.,/user_details?userid=RzmBOZf0uxreoSLaOqMcYg,"MI, MI",7/6/2022,4,"Went for lunch, very nice environment. The food was pretty good too. I got the chicken sandwich and the other people got the caesar salad with chicken and shrimp. The food and environment was good but the service could have been better. It was not a busy hour and we waited around 20 minutes to order and another 20 after we had finished for the waiter to check-in on us. If you have time, this is a good spot."

The wait was about 40 minutes , I do recall is going during the week, which wasn't bad at all. For starters , I had the crab cakes , which was cooked to perfection . And for the Entree (I requested) penne Alfredo with shrimp , which was kinda salty to the taste."

Shamorra B.,/user_details?userid=1i3fV6jvweabzK9r3i11xQ,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",8/28/2021,4,My cousin was in the mood for Italian so we came here. Looks are deceiving cause from the outside the resturant is in an unassuming building squeezed in between the other restaurants that line Smith. We decided on sitting in the outdoor dinning area but from what I seen inside is gorgeous. The food was good I had the salmon and munched on my cousins veggie lasagna which was really good too. The drinks were strong! My cousin had the blue sky drink which he liked and I had some sort of martini. The drink plus the heat was responsible for me taking a nap at 11:30 pm. I liked this a lot I would definitely be back!
Chelsea L.,/user_details?userid=5IBvLP8QIO2F0RJFCu84wA,"Brooklyn, NY",11/4/2021,4,I come here regularly. I always try something different on the menu. I had the bison burger it was delicious. The bottomless deal never disappoints. Hard to find a brunch spot in the middle of the week

The atmosphere, the vibe, and the food all great. They sang happy birthday to my husband and offered fresh strawberries with chocolate drizzle and cream on a plate that said happy birthday. The French toast was delicious as well as the steak and eggs. We met some great people who was also celebrating a birthday as well. As a matter of fact there was another young man celebrating his birthday.  Overall is was a phenomenal experience and we will be back. Thanks to the staff and manager of Verde restaurant.  Oh I forgot we had two pitchers of mimosas  which were delicious."

I am traveling from Texas and this was a very pleasant fall experience for me. What made me the happiest the most was about the servers they were the best making sure we got everything perfectly. And that for me tells how the place is run by great owners and are great with everyone who works there. Will definitely come here again and i have already recommended my from Home to definitely come to Verde on Smith when they visit New York."
Kadeesha L.,/user_details?userid=t0yamaWKaSInp6AoVPmJZA,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",8/13/2020,4,"Miss brunching in Brooklyn? This is the place for you! Ample amounts of outdoor seating available in the back and front of the restaurant, 90 minute bottomless drinks to add on to your entree for an additional $16.99. Need I say more? Well how about most of the brunch options are under twenty bucks like the french toast, pancakes and omelettes ! If that hasn't tickled your fancy, stop by for the steak and cheese sandwich that has ACTUAL pieces of steak on it, not that smashed flattened chopped up mess that some call a steak sandwich. This is the real deal. Comes with a side salad and fries too. All of which I ended up piling onto my sandwich! Be ware of peak hours! This place gets packed! All for good reason."
Sacheen V.,/user_details?userid=QuWYxm3ij1Qsa9mUH371Xw,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",3/22/2021,5,This place was pretty busy on a Saturday evening. Showed up around 6:30ish. Seated quickly. They have outdoor seating on the sidewalk and also outside in the back of the restaurant. Nicely lit. Romantic Italian music playing in the background. I had a Sangria which in my opinion tasted like juice. Hefty glass but a waste of calories for me. Didn't bother to order another. We had calamari for starters and it was fresh and delicious!! Not greasy. Loved it. It was a lot. So took some home. I ordered the penne bistecca which was delicious!! So tasty. Again a lot of food on the plate. My man had steak and mashed potatoes which was also tasty. It came with salad on the side! So good! Lots of food. We both ended up bringing it home and had it for next day brunch!!! Will definitely return! Loved the ambiance and service.
Alexander Q.,/user_details?userid=f89UBlc078ljQXof20LUZQ,"New Brunswick, NJ",5/3/2022,5,Great service! The Bellinis are delicious and so is the food. The staff go above and beyond. Definitely coming again.

They were making sure all the tables and guests were far apart, and provided hand sanitizer to everyone as they entered the restaurant. It was not packed and everyone maintained their distance in the backyard and in the front of the restaurant. The garden patio was lovely and the food was great as well. The drinks were ok.

Generous portion and the sauce was delicious, tangy and perfectly al dente noodles served up with tender breaded chicken coated in mozzarella. Some of the best chicken parm I've ever had.  We returned the next day because the service and food were amazing and we really wanted to try the Kobe burger.  It also was fantastic! Perfectly cooked and juicy.  The atmosphere, service, and food were all incredible back-to-back!"

The waiter brought them out back to back without us having to prompt or call for service. The food was great. No complaints at all about anything.
Luis B.,/user_details?userid=8YLVgcP14KP_I6WI25f2Uw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/22/2022,3,"We were in the neighborhood and decided to stop by to try out. We ended up having some spicy margaritas and moscow mules, which were refreshing and delicious. Also had an order or crab cakes which were OK. place is nice and has outside seating in front and back. bar holds about 6-8 people. This place is known for their everyday brunch so I will swing by and try that out soon."

My girls and I proceeded with agave margaritas made amazing, and ordered calamari and mussels. The mussels I prefer with white sauce and they were delish. Not a lot of broth, but still so good! They always serve bread with olives and oil- I love me some bread. The calamari was crispy and fine. Service was nice. Will be back to try more for dinner. Recommend to locals and anyone else looking for good quality Italian cuisine."
Syon S.,/user_details?userid=X99AffpoU9nLWSRL4YqWjA,"Brooklyn, NY",10/3/2020,5,"I've always wanted to come here, I'm a major yelper and I've had this establishment bookmarked for quite some time now. I must say it did not disappoint me nor my two friends. The drinks were tasty and strong, you get an array of flavors and specialty drinks. The staff makes sure your comfortable, gives you adequate time to order what you want. The food was Exquiste for brunch, I had the French toast which was dripping in syrup and the taste is indescribable. Come and try for yourself and you'll know what I mean. I give this place a 10/10."
Heaven ..,/user_details?userid=zLQpJmqp1aUINDo8KXA0BQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",4/6/2022,3,I've been to Verde on two separate occasions and on both times the food was very anticlimactic. The ambiance at night is amazing especially when dinning in the greenhouse! When I dinned for brunch I was met with more abrasive service in comparison to when I went for dinner. The workers behaved very dismissive towards me and my partner our whole brunch. During my dinner experience I may of been graced with our waiters presence once besides when our food was being brought out. Overall I don't think I will be going back which is a shame because I see the potential. Like I said the place is beautiful and if the food taste quality and service was improved upon I think this place could've been a favorite!!
Pam B.,/user_details?userid=JG3LOQ8VSKPKQTQg1_LFNA,"Bronx, NY",9/11/2020,5,"I had a really good time, The ultimate mimosa and screw drivers had me feeling preety good. I ordered the ceaser salmon salad and it was delicious. Everything that my friends ordered they truly enjoyed. The ambiance and the decor was very chill and laid back. There definitely was a wait but it was well worth it. They took the necessary precautions to enjoy that staff and patron was both protected...Looking forward to going back."

Undercova A.,/user_details?userid=QwWD-SLuOth_Jszfvq6vcw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/17/2022,5,"An unparalleled dining experience. Starting with the welcome focaccia, I knew that this was going to be a lovely evening. We chose to sit in the garden, and it was an excellent choice. Although when we arrived it was covered, the covering was retractable. Once it was cool enough it was rolled back, allowing us to enjoy the beautiful blue sky. We ordered the baked clams and burrata appetizers for the table. Both were beautifully done, the burrata was silky as expected. Our dinner orders included the pappardelle ragu and the crispy gnocchi. The ragu dish was massive. Although I was sure I couldn't finish it, it was addictive and I did! My fellow diner was in love with the gnocchi. Can't remember the desserts, but I'm not really a dessert person. What is wonderful about this place above and beyond what I've already described is the service. The wait staff is absolutely lovely and attentive and funny. Well trained in how to make guests happy. And the garden can't be beat."

Good thing we did cause the food was tasty!! We were able to get seated immediately and the waiter was friendly. The food came out in a timely manner and it was delicious. I had the veggie omelette and my friends said their food was good. We had no complaints as we could barely finish our food. I did wish we did get more potatoes with our food cause 3 potatoes wasn't enough for me. They did have big portions of eggs and we ordered a single pancake and one of my friends said it was one of the best she ever had. It was very good, thick and the edges were a little crispy. I wish I had taken one to go lol Next time in in NYC I will def visit Verde for breakfast again. I did not have any alcohol beverages but the ones I saw coming out, did look tasty."
Amelia R.,/user_details?userid=2GHRUtWZZJtuQ5rZCbTnIQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/15/2021,5,This restaurant is known for it's amazing brunch. We got there early and were seated right away. If you get there after 1pm always a wait. We loved their signature cocktails. I had the lucky lychee martini and hubby had the spicy margarita. We shared a goat cheese salad and a steak and cheese sandwich. We loved both dishes. The steak was so good and tender! Service is on point and I always saw thrm disinfecting after eaxh customer left their table which is one of the things I look for in busy restaurants! highly recommend!

However since this is a restaurant, most importantly the food leaves a lot to be desired. Chicken entrees and the octopus was overly salted.  Speaking of which, sauteing the octopus in tiny bite sized pieces in a gremolata is just too much - the cardinal rule of seafood is less is more!"

The atmosphere is great and the service is A+. You won't be disappointed in the quality of food priced reasonably. Go EAT......"
Cassidy R.,/user_details?userid=fCicfFUuwx7pemE4ddoIxQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/14/2021,4,"I came here with a friend for a Sunday brunch. There was no real wait time and the staff was super polite. I had a Pineapple Mimosa and my friend had a Raspberry Mimosa (both were part of the bottomless mimosa). For the entree I ordered buttermilk pancakes with chocolate chips and fruit and my friend ordered Nutella French toast. The food was really good and we would definitely go back there again for brunch. The only downside was the time because we were rushed to finish our food by our waiter because there was other people waiting to be seated. Mind you we came, sat, were given our drinks, ordered, waited for the food and began to eat and barely got half way through our meals before we were told they had other people waiting. Aside from that it was a fun time."
LaToya K.,/user_details?userid=4Vyg1dCILcbbLrJ_-6F4Ww,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",4/4/2021,4,A few of my friends told me Verde had a great boozy brunch so I had to come and see for myself. Came during Covid & the staff was great about keeping distance between the tables inside the restaurant. The unlimited brunch is limited to 60 minutes but the waiters are really good about giving you another drink when your current drink is done. Since this is an Italian spot I decided to try pasta as my meal. The spaghetti carbonara was very tasty and the portion size was good for the price. The drinks also tasted like they didn't skimp on the champagne/wine which I appreciated.
Jenny Y.,/user_details?userid=wC8d0RKbdHV3ZfDbUHCTaA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/29/2020,4,"We came a little after their set brunch hours and we were grateful they still allowed us to get brunch. We asked to sit outside and they took us to their back patio area. It was really nice and over each table they had heaters! It was a group of five of us and the table sat us comfortably. We ordered bottomless brunch and I got a smoked salmon eggs benedict. My boyfriend and I also ordered crab cakes to share. For the bottomless drinks, I liked that we were able to mix and match on the drinks and they had a lot of different options/flavors (bellinis, mimosas and bloody marys). The drinks also had a good balance of alcohol and juice! The crab cakes were amazing! They were packed with crab meat and the tartar sauce wasn't even needed to highlight the flavor. My smoked salmon eggs benedict was good, but it was a little fishy for my taste. I would like to try their burger next time! The fries it came with looked really good too. Our waiter was also very nice and attentive. Whenever we ran out of drinks, he'd come right away and ask what we'd like next. Overall, a great brunch spot to catch up with friends!"

Drinks are generously portioned and the bottomless option is a great deal as they are always coming around asking you what drink you want next. Good portions are generous and very tasty. The atmosphere is inclusive and electrifying. Good music good food and over all a positive vibe
Elisabetta D.,/user_details?userid=oDo9o0oxE3_4U5Q8sPNAmA,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",11/26/2021,3,"My dad and I went here on Thanksgiving and I was thankful for the services, which was superb. The food, however, I wouldn't say that it's authentic Italian. It may be inspired Italian food, but the spices have more of a Spanish / Latin twist to them. There was an appetizer we ordered of crab cakes and baked clams. The crab cakes were great, but the baked clams for 6 pieces were anticlimactic. There was more baked crumbs then being able to taste the clam, and two of them didn't have any clam inside of them. Each clam cost  wise was $3 a piece. They were so tiny for being that pricey. The server was kind enough to remove it from the bill because we were unsatisfied with the order of the clams. The salmon was a bit on the dry side for me and the couscous and side of broccoli rabe was flavorless. I made reservations thinking that this place was known for their seafood dishes and it was a bit of a disappointment. Maybe if there is a different approach in the kitchen and menu a bit for those specific dishes could have resulted in a better experience. The atmosphere and ambiance on the other hand was nice."
Elizabeth M.,/user_details?userid=Xjvkq4MYfckpLYyPT0LcgA,"Brooklyn, NY",8/12/2021,5,"Brunching here is definitely a must!!! The crowds are a true indicator of it's popularity. Came here over the weekend as Family was in town and wanted a place with a hip crowd and good food. Glad we chose Verde on Smith. While I did not make a reservation and called ahead for wait time, they honored the wait which was about 20 mins on a fully packed day. People patiently waited outside to be seated. Once we were seated, we were greeted with Water and a Menu. There is a 60 min seating limit to keep the flow going, which is understandable. We started with the unlimited mimosas for $20 P/P. Given the large crowds, we were afraid that we wouldn't get our hours worth of drinks...boy was I wrong. Our server kept our glasses full as we were sipping our last sip...definitely a winner in my book!!! The platter choices were the chicken crepe with a side of scrambled eggs and turkey sausage , Pancakes and a Nutella filled dish. All dishes came out pretty quickly and were abundantly served. You may definitely take left overs Home as I was unable to finish mine despite it being so delicious. I will definitely be back to try other platters. All in all a great meal with reasonable prices!"

We were recommended the stuffed shrimp and I'm so glad we got it!"
Grace R.,/user_details?userid=2h55hs1SVy9rkX1ibdUDAg,"Parlin, NJ",12/19/2021,3,"I visited on a Saturday late afternoon. The noise level was great, enough chatter to feel alive, but there was no problem hearing each other. I ordered the shrimp scampi with spinach and risotto. The shrimp had an iodine taste, the risotto was so-so, and the spinach was inedible, and I love spinach. My dinner companion ordered the grilled, sliced chicken, which she said was very good. The service was very good, but I wouldn't go back due to my dish."
Paul G.,/user_details?userid=sZ5WL8QgiYuWL50MjH1h5Q,"Brooklyn, NY",11/30/2020,5,Places like verde should be all over like liquor stores! They are able to bring the joy out of you with there delightful food and don't forget there unlimited brunch.. The staff has been so on point.. visit them and endure there amazing food and ambiance!!!

The heated patio is nothing short of perfection. It's so cozy and the ambiance is top tier. The bottomless brunch is a wonderful experience and the wait staff is pretty consistent about keeping an eye out for when you're running low, so you'll rarely have to ask before they tend to you. I will definitely be back for the remainder of the cold months in the city. I would definitely recommend to anyone!"
Chanelle H.,/user_details?userid=59gDU5M-nzt0WIKAVE_yPA,"Brooklyn, NY",10/21/2020,2,Wow I'm super confused about all of these good reviews. This was easily some of the worst tasting Italian food I've ever had. Crab cakes tastes like they were frozen. The pasta isn't even cooked fresh the actual Alfredo has 0 flavor. Why does this place have 4 stars??? How are you am Italian restaurant with out good Italian food. They should be ashamed they severed these plates.
Julia C.,/user_details?userid=Fr-wyTWN-lB5WMbadiAWXA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/29/2022,5,"Went on Saturday for Birthday brunch. We got there around 11:30 and were seated right away in the back. Be got a pitcher of mango belini's which was incredible. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. We had steak hollandaise, (tender and delicious), Florentine hollandaise & a Spanish omelet. Food was great. I have walked by here dozens of times, we will be back."
Paola S.,/user_details?userid=QCnuOKSwtxAE3WyQbjrYXA,"Queens, Queens, NY",12/19/2020,5,"I love to come here for Brunch !! My first time was during the summer and the bottomless makes it amazing. They keep the drinks coming, very polite and attentive staff. The summer outdoors area was beautiful, I felt so comfortable eating, Very naturey surroundings. During the fall, The seating in the back is still comfortable and warm. The food is really good, Fresh fruits and Good drinks at an affordable price. Loved this Place, Great Experience !"
Michelle C.,/user_details?userid=6bxI3OAKy1RTYqg1b7ZO7A,"Brooklyn, NY",3/20/2021,5,Came here for lunch at around 11:30am on Saturday and beat the rush!

Presentation of food was good, maybe a little too crowded? maybe smaller portions of the salad and fries? (4 of 5). Overall, it was good. We didn't had a chance to try the bottomless drinks, next time!"
Trichelle S.,/user_details?userid=ebMaqk8UQVBTtMlNiA3oOg,"Jamaica, NY",2/20/2021,3,"3.5 stars because the customer service was perfect ! In regards to the food I honestly wasn't  blown away. Decided to go for a  ""bottomless brunch"" on a Monday. This wasn't a true bottomless brunch-- I was able to count how many glasses I had for the hour I was there. I have no problem spending money on food, but this spot was definitely overpriced. Would just recommend for drinks and an appetizers."
Mark O.,/user_details?userid=QK4ykxbUzmFjysQ4-be5nA,"Brooklyn, NY",4/17/2022,3,"We were frequent patrons of this restaurant pre-covid and always walked out more than satisfied...post-covid, however, the place is still decent but just a shadow of it's former self (and possibly under new ownership or management).  I have a big problem with them serving frozen vegetables (mine were straight out of a '70's TV dinner - peas & carrots - thought i'd never see that again).  To be fair, cocktails were good, but we are unlikely to return...too many similar-priced restaurants in the neighborhood that now seem superior to Verde..."
Christena B.,/user_details?userid=qubkgaprTlTR-7Ei6NmCmg,"Brooklyn, NY",8/14/2020,5,The food was so delicious and fresh. I asked for the spaghetti shrimp with scallops in cream sauce. It was not on the menu but I saw it on yelp and the waiter had it made for me. It was good my only issue was it needed a little salt. Otherwise service was great ambiance was great and food was good. I will be back.
Louise L.,/user_details?userid=iEpINCdmeOoSEjt_kj3VwQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1/9/2021,4,Came here today for brunch with the family. They have 3 areas for seating. One is in the front on the streets with the heaters with one side open area. Then there is a semi open area in the back of the restaurant with the heaters. On the other side they have plastic pods for each table big enough for 4 people. I prefer the pods since it's individually separated from everyone else. Though it was on the chilly side since no heaters. The food came out fast and it was delicious. It looked good and tasted good. My grilled chicken sandwich was flavorful and was not dry. The egg over avocado toast was yum!  It was runny and flavorful .  Overall the food and service was good. The workers were attentive. The only thing that I was eh about was the drinks. We got hot chocolate and coffee and it was small for the price it cost. Otherwise everything else was good!
Melissa G.,/user_details?userid=OipEBURRJe4_ktREfWclkw,"New York, NY",7/31/2020,5,"I'm giving Verde on Smith 5 stars, especially during the very NY TOUGH days of COVID-19! I stumbled upon Verde online in April 2020, since it was one of the few great Italian restaurants that remained open for business including lunch hours. It soon became one of my few ""go-to"" reliable spots for delivery! Everything - everything - everything is amazing! I'm making my way down the menu, but my favorites would be chicken francaise, penne bisteca, papardelle portobello, pork chop pizzaiola, Niçoise salad, Tuscan stuffed shrimps and octopus! I remember even the cheesecake dessert was perfect - very light and not too sweet. They raised the bar for food delivery - with excellent food quality, delivery speed, and wonderful customer service! They now have their own site for delivery as well, so be sure to order through there. I can't wait to check out their outdoor seating."
Anna D.,/user_details?userid=WZg-ig1wiDWR5swBWE3SCA,"Brooklyn, NY",2/27/2021,3,"Was really excited to try this brunch spot, unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. I've always walked by and saw lines so I was intrigued. I ordered the crab cakes to start, they were subpar. Followed by the eggs benedict with steak. Even though the steak was perfect for my taste, the eggs were supposed to be the star of the show. Unfortunately, neither of the eggs were runny like a poached egg was supposed to be, both of them came off as more soft-boiled. My boyfriend got pancakes which were good, soft and fluffy. However, nothing worth remembering. The service was decent however. I'd probably return for their bottomless brunch drinks, but other than that, I don't see myself frequenting."
Aj W.,/user_details?userid=DDu3SA7LfGtF_JDFHHMOxw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2/18/2022,5,"Honestly, we was not suppose to come to this establishment as we had other plans. I'm so glad those plans failed. We were looking for a good spot that offered brunch on the weekdays- this place did not fail. I got the French toast and was not disappointed. Can honestly say the best I've ever had from any restaurant. Bottomless brunch is also great and fairly priced. Overall such a great experience and overall service. Will definitely be returning. Take some time and try them out 10/10"
Tracey F.,/user_details?userid=jCapH5edrZlAEOoMGxovgQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",8/6/2021,5,I was recommended by a friend!

Great vibes. 8/10 definitely would recommend to anyone
Aliyah K.,/user_details?userid=g1_XKLnBu-vADMGWJGDxIA,"Manhattan, NY",9/13/2021,4,"I came here for brunch with my friends and it's such a cute place! I really liked it and the food was delicious and affordable. The reason I'm knocking off a star is because our waiter hurried us in ordering and eating when there was plenty of other tables available. We were standing around waiting for a friend who was running late but another waiter told us to sit and wait for her. Then another waiter came to take our order and we told him we were waiting on someone and he was quite rude. Regardless, I think the restaurant is cute and has delicious food!"

Tashé W.,/user_details?userid=MyAdnKfMz0V9l50YMi0J1A,"Brooklyn, NY",3/26/2022,5,Actually super good. Minimal complaints except for this avocado toast. It literally came with a slither of avocado. Super fancy looking but not at all what I expected in terms of avocado.

I've come twice once for dinner and for brunch and both times I've enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The grilled branzino was cooked perfectly. The green sauce on the fish gave it a lot of flavor otherwise it was seasoned ok. The octopus was delicious and their drinks we're pretty good. The brunch was also really great. We had a 16 bottomless mimosa for an hour which was really consistent and the French toast was soooo good. My bf enjoyed the steak and eggs.
Neha K.,/user_details?userid=YsnUy-P8vE_zR6fHGxoI4A,"Newton, MA",7/26/2021,5,I went here last month and ordered the Viva Nutella crepe and Italian omelette.

Madeline W.,/user_details?userid=p2SPXwOY5EgpGC1isNxxzQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/11/2021,5,The BEST brunch in Brooklyn! They offer bottomless brunch on weekdays (which was very difficult for me to find) and it was amazing and made my 21st birthday memorable. Such an affordable place with delicious food. The waitstaff was very personable and took great care of my table. Will definitely be visiting again very soon!

With that said, let me tell you this... I'm typically a dramatic person, but I'm not exaggerating when I say the food smelled and tasted so good it brought me to literal tears. I got the seafood stuffed shrimp and penne bistecca with mashed potatoes on the side. Everything was cooked to perfection I will tell you this, my heart and tummy are truly content from this meal.

If I were to come back, I would try the smoked salmon avo toast! Overall, service was great and it was very beautiful out in the back.

My niece celebrated her birthday there for the first time and couldn't stop talking about how much she loved the food and the amazing verde staff who celebrated with her. AND  the cocktails are heaven sent ( blue sky cocktail). You must visit. MY FAVE DISH IS THE SALMON SCALLOPINI AND THE STUFFED SHRIMP. I was pleasantly greeted at the door and seated in a timely manner. It can't get better than this. Verde is the best."
Jen C.,/user_details?userid=pfFPmmeYD4u15k9FoNHMCQ,"Las Vegas, NV",8/16/2019,3,First time having brunch at this place. They offer a lot of food for an affordable price. I got the Nutella French Toast which was garnished with fresh fruit. The toast was slightly burnt which was off putting due to the overwhelming chocolate hazelnut taste. The rosemary potatoes were crispy and flavorful. It was busy when we went so I can't decide if they didn't want to interrupt people talking or if service was lack luster because it took over 20 minutes to get our check to pay.
Jillian B.,/user_details?userid=b_jBiD3QMOHrZTTlq6TjKw,"Amityville, NY",4/14/2021,4,"I really enjoy that they have multiple seating spaces.  We opted for the back patio which was small but still enough room to social distance.  The service was great, multiple people checked on us to see if we were good.  We came for brunch and really enjoyed the food.  The best part is that they do brunch throughout the week which is major bc most places only offer on the weekends.  Will be one of my go to places from now on."

My boyfriend had shrimp scampi-again cold!!! WTF?!!  No one came over to ask us how our meal was!!!! Sucked don't waste your $$$!
Solange S.,/user_details?userid=h-opkziuoJR7CIbB6IlY-Q,"Brooklyn, NY",12/3/2020,5,"I'm a regular at Verde on Smith and I must admit, they've continued their excellent service throughout the public health crisis. The staff makes you feel very welcomed. If you do the unlimited mimosa/Bellini option, you won't be disappointed because your glass will always be filled. They feel like family because they're so welcoming. I recommend it to all of my friends. The food is top tier as well as the drinks. Cute date spot as well with their outdoor option even during the cold months. Most important, they implement all COVID-19 requirements without interfering with quality service."

Diana K.,/user_details?userid=vXWxuiEvkO1uU0EfR6QqGg,"Brooklyn, NY",11/2/2021,5,"I really never write reviews. But I wanted to take the time to thank this establishment for making it possible for my daughter and her friends to celebrate her birthday. It's not easy to find a space that will accommodate 10 people at one table outside. The outdoor space on the back is really nice. They have a retractable roof, the have heaters, it's well lit. They were very happy to open the roof up significantly when I asked, since I was with a group a 6th graders, not all of them vaccinated. The service was great. They were lovely with the kids and the food was delicious. Support this restaurant!"
David T M.,/user_details?userid=HC56Ca7zGVuRJkk82l_uog,"New York, NY",3/4/2021,5,"This spot came highly recommended from a friend.   I made the trip from Uptown Manhattan to meet a friend for daily Brunch.   The service, the food, the ambience, the quality and quantity was absolute perfection.   I had the Steak and Eggs and washed it down with Mimosas.   I'm looking forward to inviting more friends and returning to feast again."
Philip H.,/user_details?userid=OaDKFv9zEeJZYZUXF0GBtg,"Raleigh, NC",6/28/2021,4,"Ordered take out. Sautéed spinach, farfalle with mushrooms and grilled skirt steak and tirimosu(?).  Large portion for the money and very tasty."

Isabella S.,/user_details?userid=OYMC1X0OmRTvQkhK7M2WPQ,"Brooklyn, NY",1/23/2021,5,"Verde on Smith is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants and is definitely worthy of 5 stars. Every meal I've had here has been delicious from brunch to dinner. For brunch I typically get the cheesesteak sandwich and it's delicious. I love that they have bottomless mimosas but during the warmer weather days, the wait can be very long. Don't show up at 1 pm on a Saturday or Sunday and expect less than a 45 minute wait. They take your name and add it to a list and then call your name when your table is ready. For dinner I've gotten the penne vodka and the steak madeira and both were soooo good. Large portions and nicely presented. I've also tried the chicken wings, calamari and mussels and all were delicious as well. Really have no complaints! The service is always great. There has only been one time where I had bad service, but it was during brunch hour which is always so busy so I understand things can happen. They have been super accommodating and innovative during COVID and it's a shame we cannot dine indoors and further patronize this great business."

Paula J.,/user_details?userid=j-HIONgNLY8OJ1NSIwCz9g,"Brooklyn, NY",7/4/2021,2,Nice place for brunch drinks. But the food has to be taken back twice.

Hector J.,/user_details?userid=ux-LOou9TAKPs5ThbPmkPQ,"Brooklyn, NY",1/19/2021,5,"As a native New Yorker there's nothing that can stop me from eating out with my wife and child even during a pandemic. This past year has been difficult as some of our favorite places have either closed or have switched to takeout only. While surfing Instagram looking for a new breakfast spot I stumbled upon Verde on smith and was immediately excited to try it out as they had HEATED OUTDOOR SEATING!! Ofcourse I had to check out the menu and see some thoughts other YELPERS had. After a few minutes of surfing pics and reviews my wife, daughter and I jumped on the train eager to try a new spot. How this place remained unknown to me for so long pre pandemic is beyond me. My wife and I both decided to try one of their signature omelettes. She went with the Italian and I went with the Spanish. Both came With a side of potato wedges and salad. The best part for me personally was the fact that you could taste that it was fresh mozzarella cheese. This place had great food, great ambiance and an even better server. Megan was attentive but not pushy and never missed any of our subtle cues. (More water, hot sauce and ketchup and check) if the food wasn't the best I'd still come back for her service anytime. Def a place worth checking out and If you want to avoid huge wait times try them weekdays in the  morning."
Marina P.,/user_details?userid=SXAKOjkRYd0T2PsTCC9C-w,"Chicago, IL",10/6/2021,5,"LOVE their whole branzino! Ordered twice from them and so far a consistent (that matters, doesn't it?), delicious experience."
Kennie G.,/user_details?userid=H-dcvHjgdp84SXKVKRRAJQ,"San Francisco, CA",11/24/2020,5,Came for the amazing lunch. Stayed because they actually adhered properly to Covid safety measures. We were 6 feet away from other people in the restaurant. I felt safe eating out with friends again and have an refreshing drink. New York is still alive.
Mini A.,/user_details?userid=T8-Su_bTCnQ1iN09Jvvm5Q,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",11/20/2020,5,Loved this place! The food is delicious and the stuff is super nice! The COVID precautions are taken very seriously and considerably. Definitely coming back with more friends!

Daughter had the eggs Benedict which she enjoyed, but there was not much hollandaise sauce and it was a little cold. Overall nice experience."

Pam W.,/user_details?userid=ZDaAnyJ5LYyEfkiYXHcchw,"Brooklyn, NY",12/8/2019,4,Simply delicious. I prefer dinner over brunch. Service is prompt and food is always fresh.

Chelsea P.,/user_details?userid=PHVGUeauQqCL9U_GsrHW-A,"Brooklyn, NY",9/22/2018,5,I truly enjoyed my time here at Verde . On a Friday night you would think it would be super crowded but it was the total opposite it was empty and just me and my friend enjoying our meal . The ambiance is absolutely beautiful and I would recommend going before it gets too cold because sitting outside is just so nice and the breeze was just right and you can talk and people watch it was just perfect . I had the spaghetti Puttanesca. It was so flavorful and so light and they gave you such an amazing portion of food and of course they have beautiful bread before you eat with a nice olive oil . It was really delicious and the staff was really sweet and were really good to us . Going to come back for brunch !
Temperance B.,/user_details?userid=ae8XS1aSiXC2Hk9O4v78RA,"Queens, Queens, NY",12/6/2020,5,"I went today to celebrate a sweet friend's birthday. We indulged in the bottomless mimosa brunch menu.

In addition, food was hot in temperature, seasoned to perfection, and absolutely delicious! There were zero complaints in our party! We will DEFINITELY be going again!"

Neicy N.,/user_details?userid=8wHYcYpPLkQJ-u0UZcxRnQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9/10/2019,5,"This place was amazing ; it seem like a very popular spot. My girls and i did the bottomless brunch for 2 hours with the choices of Bloody Mary , mimosas , Bellini (with different flavors) , screw driver and champagne. I will say the food was good we just had appetizers but it was good. The drinks are very strong especially if your not a drinker like me. But it's worth every dime. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Who wants to enjoy brunch , plus they do brunch every day however the bottomless brunch isn't occurring during the weekend only on the weekends."
Nia L.,/user_details?userid=iNMBjQlL8zIWCeVFERn9AQ,"Glen Allen, VA",10/13/2019,5,Randomly came across this place while in NYC for a music festival. The food was delicious! The $20 bottomless mimosas were also a great deal. Definitely will be back the next time I'm in the city!

It was a slow Friday but even when I went on Father's Day and it was super busy,customer service was amazing ! Highly satisfied and will return soon. They even brought me out a piece of cake and sang happy birthday lol. Thank you verde on Smith for always having great service and great food with great prices."

In winter, they crank up the heat to keep you warm. They accommodate well for large groups, so it's perfect for celebrations. Food is well portioned and tasty. Service is on point. I enjoyed everything we ordered but the only thing that disappointed me was the Nutella crepe, which looked more like a burrito than a crepe. Definitely will be going back to try more things."

Kuzi G.,/user_details?userid=5Qvvqu2vQdOXnhQroarKvg,"Brooklyn, NY",3/3/2021,3,Have always wanted to try this place and finally got to check it out recently with my husband for breakfast. The backyard garden is really nice combo or indoor outdoor and wasn't too cold - they also had heaters as well. It's a really nice space with good staff. The food however just wasn't all that. I ordered the avocado toast which just seemed to fall flat. It's sliced avocado instead of the spread style I'm accustomed to for avocado toast. My husband had the salmon eggs Benedict and he also said it was okay not great. Just seem to not be as flavorful and delicious for some pretty simple basic breakfast dishes. On a positive note they have bottomless mimosas which is great but would have been better if the staff came around more frequently to make it worth your while. Not sure we'd go back.

Nala P.,/user_details?userid=f0ky_aw9bwdlcyFJLYJYBA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/1/2020,2,"Brunch review- burger was a sloppy gross mess. The party was all grey with no char or color on it, also unseasoned and very wet. It was on a super soggy bun falling apart. For $16 this was a terrible burger and I will bet anyone $$$$$ that it is 100% NOT Kobe beef as described, no way in hell. The meat tasted like some old chuck blend from Associated Supermarket. The worst part was it was so soggy and falling apart it couldn't even be cut in half and eaten I had to cut it up and try to eat it. Mixed greens on side has barely any dressing but has a funk to them like they were never washed. Overall $30 for burger and mimosa was a huge waste. I will never go back here or recommend it, was awful."

I chose to have  the Nicoise  salad and i added  salmon , i love feta cheese they were so kind to give me a side of feta cheese made my day i also had a cappuccino , it was cool . ! The waitress was extremely warm . My dining partner had the same salad but with tuna and agree it was DELICIOUS,  he also has the mussels which he loved ! His drink of choice was a tequila sunrise. I decided on a "" Hendrix gin neat "" my only complaint was i ordered a "" Hendrix neat "" and the drink was barely that, it was like a  swig ,  i didn't complain because the service was awesome ! So was the food  our waitress name  was ""Yanna""  he was a very pleasant and attentive and cool ."

This restaurant literally had a line for people to be seated while all other establishments looked deserted. This is a plus, a sign of good service and food. Daughter and I waited 10-15 minutes before being seated ( would've been less, but I opted for patio seating). Once seated, we immediately saw why this place was packed.....$17 bottomless brunch w/ 90 mins mimosas!!! I ordered a billini and veggie burger which came with side salad and fries my daughter ordered gingerale and chicken fettuccini Alfredo. I've had bland veggie burgers, so was a bit nervous, but this one was well done on a toasted bun with lettuce & tomatoes. Soft and flavorful to the bite. The fries were seasoned with Cajun and a light crisp. The chicken alfredo looked well done, and chicken were evenly distributed to the pasta. It was eaten within 10 minutes!! (Safe to say my daughter loved it!). The Bellinis were definitely on point! If you read my other post you know I like a ""happy buzz"" awesome spot, the waiter was attentive... Gave a good tip... Worth the wait!"

We were calculating the tip but he was in a hurry for a new table took our plates and then confront us saying the tip wasn't good enough! I am not cheap we were waiting to get more change. Later, the two bus  boys apologized to us. FYI we had already tip the busboys earlier. I never felt to embarrassed in my life!"

Ashley P.,/user_details?userid=RhKXX_sxl-HieEaOWiXH5w,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",7/14/2021,5,"This is the BEST bottomless brunch spot I've had in YEARS! So good, everything was perfect! The mimosas were amazing and my steak and eggs were to die for!!!! I enjoyed it so much I will definitely be back like every week during summer for sure! My new fav spot in Brooklyn!"
Becca L.,/user_details?userid=7hgsVKUqIhikuJuW5aJfiw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",6/28/2021,1,The wait was horrendous. I came here during the brunch time period. The host brought me and my girls to the back . It was extremely hot and the waiter was barely paying us any mind. I ordered an omelette with cheese and I didn't receive that . When I asked to change it they just slapped a slice and reheated it . When I said I would like a new omeletee with cheese they just took my original order and broke into pieces to appear as though it was scrambled. I was so upset because they wouldn't make it right . Don't bother here the food is okay not great

Dessi B.,/user_details?userid=0RDcTINKHD636acA3It2rg,"Brooklyn, NY",5/8/2019,4,"Came here for brunch. I ordered a kobe burger wnd fries. Very flavorful. They have bottomless mimosas and a brunch menu EVERYDAY from 11AM-4PM. Now you dont have to wait until weekends. Food is fresh, they never disappoint."
Claudia S.,/user_details?userid=HWU0mODXY9YzRwTE6PafEA,"Beacon, NY",8/26/2021,3,"The restaurant was comfortable,  service was very good but the food was not. The wine was fair  The one exception was the grilled octopus which was very tasty and Cesar salad was ok. The meal went downhill after that. The Bronzino was supposed to be grilled but it was clearly fried first then grilled because we did see grill marks on it. It was very overcooked. The chicken parm was thick snd not tasty. They charged an extra $5.00 for paying by credit card. The meal was not cheap either. We went here because of good reviews we'd read and were very disappointed"

Mark A.,/user_details?userid=VL6KOv9meYd2FAY7fSB6Hg,"Brooklyn, NY",11/7/2020,3,"I have been living in the neighborhood for over 7 years and this is my first time ordering from them, via delivery. In a quick summary, it was a bit disappointing for the price they charge for (18 each). Refer to the photo. (1) carbonara - it was plain, somewhat blend, and thin. Lacks flavors and I could literally count the amount of tiny pieces of smoked prosciutto inside. They skimmed so much (2/5 points). (2) grilled chicken Alfredo - the chicken was dry, but ok, flavor is simple and alfredo sauce was thick and on-point. THis is the best among the 3 entrees i ordered (4/5 points). (3) Meatballs marinara - the pasta was tender, meatball was thick but dry and lacks flavor (where are the spices and herbs?), sauce was average (3/5 points). OVERALL, they don't taste authentic at all, all boxed pasta, quite average Italian dishes for $18 each. Next timeI would spend more and get homemade pasta with better flavor profile.  Otherwise, the delivery was fast and the packaging was very good."
Ann C.,/user_details?userid=CQRy5_um8pf0s6VSpbzEFA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/30/2020,5,"I love verde it's become one of my favorites before and during the pandemic. The owners and employees are nice and accommodating. Amazing service,... start to finish. I always have a great time when I go to verde. The food is great everything is fresh and you can tell the quality of food is never compromised. I love the brunch dishes. I recommend the Eggs Benedict Florentine. Amazing. For dinner so don't miss the lobster feast or crispy gnocchi."
Santania S.,/user_details?userid=4nDmWZ3cxvC1amM1Mq5Zkg,"Brooklyn, NY",6/23/2019,5,Great food and great service!!! This is a must for brunch!!! Brunch food was amazing. Server Hector was accommodating and host Mark was funny and so nice.

Melissa E.,/user_details?userid=XimwnYAnPn5N23hPpY8pdw,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",6/26/2020,5,"I went to this restaurant for my birthday with a group of 8 people. The staff was so nice and answered all our questions on the menu with ""yes of course!"" They gave us complimentary champagne and slice of cake that said happy birthday on the plate without us even asking for it. We ordered the grilled octopus as an appetizer and i ordered the seafood linguini for myself and it was amazing. My whole table was satisfied with their orders and the food came decent portions. I had to take half of it to go! Not to mention that the patio area itself is so nice so this restaurant was definitely a great experience. Would definitely come here again."
Alicia K.,/user_details?userid=7xKiVyw5PYeMtpAMWSsd4A,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",12/15/2020,5,I came with a large group of my friends and they were SO accommodating! The food was fresh and hot!

The bottomless drinks brunch is totally worth it  2 hours of bottomless drinks, and they're pretty quick with their service. I ordered the kings breakfast and it was very filling. The salad was delicious, as was the potatoes and pancakes. The meal was very filling and the other people in my party also liked the food and drinks. The service was very friendly and they took pictures for us. I recommend this place for good vibes and good food. The outdoor seating is very nice too!"
Amanda R.,/user_details?userid=N3i3xlh09ofIcw-18kGThQ,"Patchogue, NY",4/30/2019,4,"The biggest appeal of Verde on Smith is their 2-hour bottomless brunch option. The restaurant is small, so even with a reservation we waited about 30 minutes to be seated. However, when we were, the waitstaff and host were very accommodating. They made us a table and moved us to a larger one when it became available. Once we were settled and ordered our food, we comfortably enjoyed ourselves. Verde on Smith is clean and classy. If it was nicer out, I would have loved to take advantage of the outdoor seating option. The meals and drinks were all reasonably priced for a restaurant in Brooklyn - especially the 2-hour brunch drink deal which was only about $20 per person (significantly cheaper than other options). They were very attentive to the drink refills - you definitely get your money's worth within the time limit. The food was delicious, but the portion sizes were average with no frills. (Depending on how hungry you are, you may want to split a little something extra like we did.)"

Staff were very attentive as well.  Definitely looking forward to enjoying many meals this summer in the backyard area.

Sarah W.,/user_details?userid=9L-CLhOx-f-SqIswmmzXOQ,"Brooklyn, NY",10/25/2020,1,"Racist! Black people DO NOT go here. My friends and I (table of four) came here and the manager threw a placard on our table and took our temperature after we were seated. We watched 6 different groups of people who came in and were greeted warmly and did NOT have their temperatures taken. No one came to ask us if we were ok. We watched other tables get their food first after arriving before them. When we had enough and told the manager we would pay for our drinks and wanted to leave because of the horrible experience, he didn't apologize or anything. All he said was for us to stay because our food was coming out. There were no apologies. No one tried to make things right. Will NEVER go here and don't recommend for any person of color to go here and have the same bad experience."
Stephanie J.,/user_details?userid=_KZ5wBIMIBYDHvCeN2hqvQ,"Brooklyn, NY",10/25/2020,5,Came out with my girls for an early birthday brunch and OMG! It was so delicious. Wait was about an hour outside but it was so worth it. Didn't feel the hour wait at all. We sat in the patio and the waiters were so friendly and attentive. The food is DELICIOUS!! I ordered their pasta ! Yum. Definitely coming back in the near future.
Lauren M.,/user_details?userid=1FTKFPbGawfh3H_4C2-BoQ,"Brooklyn, NY",2/2/2020,5,Love love love this place. The brunch is truly unlimited mimosas. And the FRENCH TOAST IS TJE NEST I'VE EBER HAD. No exaggeration. You should definitely give them a try. Celebrated my birthday here and I've been back every Sunday
Nazeema B.,/user_details?userid=fymgKzTZx1YnFekhlW8j3g,"New York, NY",8/20/2020,4,"They have a backyard patio for outdoor seating during COVID. It was the first post COVID restaurant we dined at.

Sasha C.,/user_details?userid=65qbB9h_uLvS5JTiC-g-0A,"New York, NY",2/11/2020,3,"Prices are very fair! We came when the weather was quite nice and perfect for the outdoor seating. Only word of advice is... check the weather for the day prior. Unfortunately for us, we sat right by the awning and had drips of water hit every single one of us the entire brunch (moreso on 1 particular seat), which was very annoying. We mentioned it to the waiter and he just smiled at us as if we were speaking a foreign language so nothing was done at all. Our glasses were nearly empty the entire time, yes we had bottomless drinks but there were a few who didn't and relied on hydrating with water. As for the food, we all enjoyed the dishes and they were fairly priced. Another thing to note is I had ordered a side of bacon that came out way too crisp. It actually was burnt so I'd requested it to be remade. I also found myself extra hungry that day, although I don't think the dish was that small but I ended up ordering an extra dish. They didn't rush us out which was good but also probably because they were all too busy to do that."
Kai G.,/user_details?userid=8tDxqM_zYMI3Y8q_JUHlIg,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",3/16/2019,5,"This is one of my go to restaurants for in Brooklyn. The food is amazing, the ambience is comfortable get chic and the staff is beyond attentive! Verde is known for their weekend brunches but their dinner is to die for and the drinks definitely help to set the tone for a great day . My favorites for brunch are the pancakes, Nutella crepes( if you like fresh fruit and chocolate) and Salmon frittata and for dinner the salmon & mash potatoes is fresh, seasoned, and each bite just as good if not better than the first . Definitely a great date spot/ girls brunch spot/ and just about everything else low key but turnt you can imagine ."
Selin S.,/user_details?userid=gCpz0-3RwpYep1932wX8PA,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",11/28/2020,5,"My favorite restaurant in Brooklyn for sure!!They have the best food! Always so delicious!

I would definitely keep going back!"

Wenter B.,/user_details?userid=Jw9Flc1B1bWRo6mdU83zaw,"Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY",2/11/2020,4,So my boyfriend & I were dying for something to eat & wanted to try a different restaurant other than our usual. Somehow we stumbled upon verde. Customer service was on point. Every member of the staff made us feel welcome. For appetizers we had the calamari & crab cakes. Delicious. & we looove crab cakes! Now as for the entrees. I had the seafood linguine with the white sauce. It's like a white wine garlic sauce. Didn't really do it for me. The seafood was fresh. But for my taste the seasoning was sparse. My boyfriend however had the beef short ribs. When I tell you amazing is an understatement please believe me. You won't go wrong if you order this meal! Overall this place is great to check out. Would definitely go back.
Jessica A.,/user_details?userid=2JDhEpSpD9BSP4UJnTPg6A,"Jamaica, NY",12/1/2018,5,"This is one of my FAVORITE brunch restaurants in Brooklyn. I came here for brunch with my cousins. The bellinis are amazing I always rotate the flavors (raspberry, mango, and peach ). Today we decided to go with a appetizer to start off. We ordered the calamari, to my surprise the portion was extremely small and not worth $9. I must say it was flavorful I was soo disappointed that it was a small portion. I ordered the Kobe Burger medium well and it was really good. I usually get the Kobe burger or steak and eggs, those are my go too. My cousins ordered the salmon burger, steak and eggs and salmon with couscous. All of their meals were good. The staff is very nice and polite. I highly recommend getting the unlimited drinks for brunch it is worth it."

There is normally a little bit of a wait especially for brunch but it isn't anything crazy. The bottomless brunch drinks are good and you can change what drink you want out of the four they offer at any time.

Unfortunately, I didn't make it for brunch but I decided to go for dinner. I read the yelp reviews and people were saying they had great Italian food. OH WAS THEY WRONG! Let first start with them serving us white wonder bread to start us off. I've never been to a restaurant let alone a Italian restaurant where they serve white bread!? I new it would be down hill from here! I got the shrimp scampi and my BF ordered the seafood pasta dish. Both dishes lacked flavor! I I literally had to pack on parmesan cheese to get some flavor. The only plus of this whole experience was the drinks and the server was nice that's why I'm giving this place 2 stars. After the food experience I'm not even interested in the brunch and will not be returning."

It's been the best kept secret in Brooklyn the last couple of years and now it's a bustling brunch spot . I've been coming here for Brunch for the last 8 years and have never had a bad experience . The food is amazing and the drinks are even better . They also have an Awesome brunch food  selection that will definitely leave you satisfied . I've also had the pleasure of coming here for dinner and that is equally as awesome. Whether you're coming here for a small quaint brunch or celebrating an engagement like I recently have . It's definitely a great choice
Chuck M.,/user_details?userid=S6ssQw6A3oRSGpTyrfVT0g,"Manhattan, NY",1/1/2020,4,"Verde on Smith is a reliable neighborhood restaurant serving lunch, dinner, and weekend brunch. My favorites include the Canadian Eggs Benedict, the chicken crepe, and the waffles, for brunch, and a number of their pasta dishes, for dinner. Especially delicious is the Bolognese. Desserts are quite varied and include 3 kinds of gelato, tiramisu, affogato, and several kinds of cake. After-dinner cordials are also available, if a wee bit pricy. The service is excellent! All in all a wonderful place to settle in."

I got the Savory Chicken Crepe and it was phenomenal. My family got everything else on the menu and boy was everything delicious. I can especially brag about the pancakes and the French toast. It's become a repetitive craving of ours. Tell me how a pancake can be both crunchy and fluffy and the same time?! MUST GO! PERIODT!"

The owner and the waitress came over numerous times to check on us and see if we needed anything. This was so refreshing to experience at a place that offers unlimited drinks. They brought us our next round before we finished the current one. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for great food and service at a reasonable cost."

Topper D.,/user_details?userid=jQMavxPjGCz0dduJHWVV1Q,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9/8/2019,5,Great service. Great food. Hector is amazing. Eat inside for the best service. Just an FYI.

Taj T.,/user_details?userid=v1R-n1I35QJKVp_h6sAYqQ,"Manhattan, NY",11/19/2019,4,"We came to Verde on Smith for brunch on a Saturday. The service was great, food was decent (nothing out of the world tbh), and the location is very convenient. The only thing I would say is that it got so incredibly loud   that we could barely speak to each other. So if you're looking for an energetic, loud atmosphere, this is a good spot. Otherwise, you may have to head elsewhere if you want to make conversation :)"
Matt Y.,/user_details?userid=o-mX87LlpWBX8cSOWRgwcQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/3/2019,5,Great food for truely great value! (Hint: try the French toast!) service was also some of the best! Always made sure our bottomless brunch drinks were full! A great atmosphere and we'll be back very soon!

It's a 4 star because this place is always so loud and chaotic so not the place if you want to have a relaxing and/or important conversation  type of place. Other then that, I highly recommend it."
Dana G.,/user_details?userid=6ihDaI4XETQOygpOQOLq1A,"Yonkers, NY",11/16/2020,1,"COVID party over here! If you are dying for mediocre food and a case of COVID, go to Verde on Smith. Best things about this restaurant were the kind staff and cocktails. Now for the bad - the partially enclosed back patio was cramped with people and tables were not 6 feet apart. No temperature checks at the door. Staff did not wear gloves. Folks were having a great time laughing and loud talking, and spraying all of their germs throughout the venue. The food was not good. Cold wings. Soggy calamari. Rock hard French toast. Salty eggs. Burger and steaks were blah. Clearly this place is for folks who have not experienced good food.  My next destination is an urgent care center to make sure I don't have COVID because of Verde's non-compliance with COVID rules."

The food is just ""okay"". I would have expected a larger portion for the prices but the food did taste good. We had pancakes and a frittata (two deer ate entrees). We had rounds of Bellinis(mango, raspberry) as well as mimosas. Overall I would come back but I'd probably order two entrees or eat prior to patronizing"

La Rubia V.,/user_details?userid=-wqjAhn330MaZK2wPi4FXg,"Brooklyn, NY",7/20/2020,5,"What a wonderful dining experience. I found this gem on yelp and so I was pretty comfortable that the food would be great according to reviews.  It was my son's birthday and 95° outside with outdoor seating and my 82-year-old mother, among others. They didn't accept reservations and so I figured I would walk over and check out the restaurant and make sure that the outdoor seating would be acceptable considering it was supposed to be so hot.  There was a table that was inside but also  considered outside because the windows and wall were down. This table was perfect because you've got the cool air conditioning from inside the restaurant but we were also following the rules of sitting outside.  I asked the manager If I could have that table for the following day for lunch and explained the situation with my mom and that it was a special occasion.  I told him that I understand he doesn't accept reservations but I would gladly leave a deposit for the table.  He told me that it was not necessary and that he would make sure I had that table. He came through for us. The food, atmosphere and vibe was incredible. The service was wonderful. It was a perfect dining experience and birthday celebration and I appreciate so much that he accommodated us.  I will definitely be back:)"
Mara P.,/user_details?userid=qX7-tbvXeKzl8hnyAHUHGw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/11/2019,5,Truly delicious Italian with very fresh ingredients and great cooking! I've been there several times now over a few years and it always is wonderful. Love it for special occasions. Cocktails are good too.

Some of the orders included the duck, the seafood platter, the pasta, the lasagna. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I'm definitely coming back."

After the first visit, ive been back two more times because the service is unmatched. During one visit, i was having such a good time, brunch turned into happy hour at the bar. Everyone here is so friendly, the food is delicious and i love that i can make a reservation for brunch (that's hard to come by these days). The outdoor seating is great as well and even if you don't have a reservation, they always try to accomodate you. This is my new favorite place :)"

Cass M.,/user_details?userid=OAQ2IUZlruR79KVIfdkzhQ,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",9/8/2019,2,Don't know how their are so many good reviews. This was one of the most odd dining experiences. This reminded me of a touristy cafe in Europe. Everything was kind of random to me. Service was horrible.  They tried to give us shots and ask for a yelp review. Food came out wrong.. drinks were unexciting to me. Food was tasty but very basic. I've had much better Italian food from the pizzeria. They were friendly but could be more enthusiastic about the work they are doing since it is hospitality. Food was lackluster to me and I don't believe that people like it this much. You can go to so many more trendy places for this downtown Brooklyn price point

We got our drinks and waited on the other 2 members of our party to arrive. The food, ambiance and service was great.  They even gave us a bottle of bubbly for our friend's bday. Can't say enough about this place. The guys were great. We didn't leave until almost 12am. (Update ... I had to edit because my drinks were strong and I was tipsy as I wrote my review but I still stand by my 5 stars amazing)"

Jillian Q.,/user_details?userid=lZMsWrjJPJ_CEygn4y0F0g,"Huntington, NY",9/21/2019,1,Had a reservation for my friend's 21st birthday. We confirmed the reservation over the phone days prior and also over text hours before. Our party showed up on time and we were told the table wasn't ready and it would be an additional 30 minutes. It was actually more around 45 minutes when the table was set and there were the correct number of seats available. Drinks weren't anything special and the food was average. I ordered avocado toast yet they brought out a completed different dish for me. Won't be coming back here.
Diana A.,/user_details?userid=UrjqPxsHGOgE2325FxNtgw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/16/2019,5,Favorite place in Brooklyn to brunch. Excellent bottomless drinks. Good service. Always go for the steak and eggs. Fluffiest pancakes
Nicolas R.,/user_details?userid=r6xQHzikoNn8aREyuuxG4A,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9/10/2020,4,"So OVERALL, this place gets a solid 8/10. However, it DOESN'T mean it wasn't a rollercoaster either. They at first give you bread which was nice (they don't toast it) and they give you the most skimpiest portion of oil and olives I've ever seen. I actually almost choked on a pit because the olives weren't pitted, and I thought they were. Can definitely see that as being an issue. That's not important though. The main course of the meal I get the Seared Tuna and the linguine, which honestly was good but could use some seasoning. It wasn't exciting at all. But what was exciting enough for me to comeback was the pasta and marinara. It was very good, sauce wasn't too acidic and had olives that WERE pitted (thank god) and capers which those all come together so beautifully. But what wasn't expected was the added protein to my dish; a f**king hair! Especially during COVID I was kinda scarred. However Yetis, the server was so understanding and nice. He brought me another plate free of charge, and it was delicious. For dessert I had the tiramisu which was to die for. The bill ended up coming to only $37. I'll be coming here again."

After we finished our dinner the owner(Mark ) came to checking if everything was alright. Then we learned that the place is under new management for 5 months and they kept all the employees who used to work. They are doing amazing job with food, drinks and hospitality. You can find everything you're looking for from a restaurant. I'll definitely be there for trying their bottomless brunch as well. Good luck guy.

We went there with friends for dinner and drinks. We really enjoyed our meals! We had mixed appetizer plate and Greek salad to start, then salmon, shrimp, bronzino and rib-eye steak dishes for main course. Everything was very tasty and fresh, especially my rib-eye steak was simply outstanding! The portions were also pretty decent and filling. Finally, we had desert plates and some cappuccino, and it was an amazing finish for our dinner. Their homemade deserts are really so good, particularly we loved their creme brulee. You should definitely give it a try! Besides the great food, the service was very nice and friendly, which made our dinner so pleasant at Verde. I've noticed that new management pays close attention to every single detail to make their customers satisfied in all manners. We appreciate your effort guys! Keep it up! Verde is strongly recommended to everyone!"

Rita D.,/user_details?userid=BzBTw_bsj2-aza_ywCkbIA,"Manhattan, NY",11/9/2016,3,"I came here for dinner. Love the Spaghetti-don't know what kind of white sauce they used for the Spaghetti with shrimp and scallop, but it was very good. Complimentary bread and olive oil was greatly appreciated! ^^ Interior design was beautiful. Bet you're wondering why I only gave 3 stars. Well, that's because the server took a loooong time to get back me after I asked how much their house cheesecake would cost. I saw the server whispering for awhile with another behind the bar, and I just got the feeling something wasn't right. :O"

Brittany D.,/user_details?userid=GbNgDZSNcjYy9TawuDH45g,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",3/24/2019,4,Cute spot. Not the best with wait time if they are busy. It gets packed and it becomes hard to maneuver through the place BUT the service is great. They are very attentive and apologize for anything that is not to your liking. The food is good too! Mimosas are strong yet so good and their fries are amazing!

Monique M.,/user_details?userid=Fn-ox8NmUY7RBh0XelPpvw,"Bronx, NY",11/2/2016,5,"I returned here on a recent Sunday to indulge in the brunch. Luckily it was a beautiful day outside, so my friends and I were able to sit by the entrance and enjoy the view. The restaurant was loud though. About 8 women were there celebrating a birthday and face timing the occasion to someone. Anyway back to the important stuff. I ordered the delectable French toast with a side of sausage. It was soooooo darn good! The bread was fluffy and crisp with a hint of sweetness and beauty. I cannot wait to return for more. I also had a peach Bellini that was alright, it looked better than it tasted honestly, but I'm not much of a drinker. I will definitely return for brunch. I'm not sure if the dinner menu has changed since I last came, but I am open to trying it again. As far as service, it was great. The waiter and other staff were very helpful and kind. But we had to return a number of dishwater because it was either dirty or broken. A definite no-no but all is forgiven as the staff was very good at addressing the issues promptly. All-in-all I will be back."

Only thing I could say that can improve is put a little less goat cheese on the avocado toast and maybe not a lot of tomato. Makes it kinda wet and soggy. But great spot!"
Debra P.,/user_details?userid=t4hCVGrTM2erI8Izg_aRow,"Atlanta, GA",12/26/2016,4,The atmosphere is intimate and warm. The bread and oil to start was delicious.

Tomasilienne L.,/user_details?userid=qP3otbCsHT4NIMDoRdjJnw,"Brooklyn, NY",11/13/2018,3,The food was pretty good.

Mary M.,/user_details?userid=HwIG6WLwN-MVAkD_hFP5NQ,"New York, NY",7/24/2018,3,"Sat outside and the ambiance was really nice. The baked clam and the spaghetti clam and shrimp was really good also. The only thing was the wine, the menu stated 2014 and we got a 2017 bottle for the price of a 2014, very mis The waiter was not very attentive. My least favorite dish was the gnocchi... it had was too much sausage and broccoli rabe and way too salty. i would rename the dish on the menu to Broccoli Rabe and sausage with crispy gnocchi instead of Crispy Gnocchi with Sausage and Broccoli Rabe."

She ordered the chicken Cesar salad and she really enjoyed it "" it tasted exactly how I would imagine"" BTW it was our first time coming here.  I had the steak and eggs I had my steak well done and it was not dry it was tasty and juicy. Overall I will definitely be coming back and it's a good price point. 20$ pp for bottomless drinks which you can switch the flavors is dope"

I was extremely pleased by their brunch offerings. I had steak, eggs, and rosemary potatoes with a large French toast on the side. Heavenly! The French toast is heavenly! We've ventured here a few more times. I had their Nutella Crepes which is very sinful. They offer a drink special for $19.99 you can enjoy as much drinks as you want for 2 hours. You can't beat that. I love the area Cobble Hills its quaint with a lot of hip restaurants and bars."

This place really knows how to serve up a great brunch! From ambience to food to service, I haven't found a misstep yet! I was first here last month for my birthday brunch, and they treated me like a queen! My waiter was excellent! My husband is usually super hard to please, and even he really enjoyed our meal. He got the steak and eggs and I opted for the French toast. The french toast is delicious! One of my favorites all year, and I consider myself to be a french toast connoisseur. It's not an easy feat to be well portioned on thick brioche, yet not so thick that it's unpleasantly ""doughy"". They manage the right amount of lightness and don't skimp on the fruit. Loved it. My husband's meal was really well cooked and well seasoned too.  Most importantly, all the food was hot! Lukewarm food is a big pet peeve of mine, so Verde did not disappoint here. We both had the unlimited drink special (20 dollars for 2 hours) and I love that you can rotate through different deliciously flavored bellinis (mango,peach, raspberry), mimosas and Bloody Mary's. Between the two of us we tried all but the Blood Mary, and all were strong and great tasting! I went back again 2 weeks later with my family and again another home run. We can't wait to return to try dinner, love this place!"
Dania Maria S.,/user_details?userid=0E4-OPVSPdT4yY1rFoVV4A,"New York, NY",4/9/2016,5,"Had brunch with two friends at Verde and we absolutely loved it.

Our server was very attentive and amicable. We really enjoyed our time there and will definitely be going back."
Dwayne M.,/user_details?userid=XYJuZk4u4XsxpmwspLj4qA,"Brooklyn, NY",3/27/2016,4,Went to Verde on Smith for a brunch on Easter. I had the the steak and it was amazing.

I would definitely recommend this place and I'm going back to explore the dinner menu.

Sarah L.,/user_details?userid=Ve38EmmBmaO9_nKajJ37VQ,"Newton, NJ",9/21/2019,1,"I made a reservation for this place for Sept. 15, for 13 people, and requested outside seating. I called a few days before to confirm the reservation and outdoor seating. 30 minutes before we arrive I get a text from the restaurant asking to confirm our reservation. As I was on the subway, I got the chance to answer FIVE MINUTES later. The manager then responded saying he had given our table to someone else. When we arrived at 2 for our scheduled reservation, the manager made us wait for thirty minutes. Then proceeded to sit us at a table not for 13 AND inside. I asked why we weren't outside and why we had to wait thirty minutes and the manager responded with ""you can wait another twenty minutes if you want to sit outside"". As someone who works as a server and has been a hostess, this treatment of customers with a large table and confirmed reservation was in all honesty BS. If it wasn't my birthday I would have left and gone somewhere else. Not respecting our reservation and being rude because they messed up was absolutely appalling and I am shocked that that man is a legitimate manager. 0/10 do not recommend at all. I wish there was someone above a manager there to speak to because I was absolutely appalled."

The pancakes are my absolute favorite. I've also had the french toast, steak & eggs, and eggs benedict. Oh and they keep the mimosas and bellinis flowing if you decide to do the unlimited.I took off a star because sometimes the servers can be a little hasty, but I recommend this place to anyone. There aren't too many brunch places in Brooklyn that I love but Verde is high on the list. Go here!"

When the birthday girl arrived the host was quite brusque with her. He asked her where her guests were and advised her that the two hour booze would stop flowing two hours after her reserved time regardless of when her guests began drinking. She and most of the party arrived about 30 minutes after the reservation time...Yeah, can't blame him for his attitude. Every dish we ordered was good (steak and eggs, eggs benedict, Kobe burger, shrimp Caesar salad, salmon) and the drinks were excellent and a really, really good value. We had no issues with refills. One order was incorrect, but they fixed it as promptly as possible. The patio looked like a nice spot to eat, but we sat inside and it was cozy and comfortable. Two hour meter parking outside, except on Sunday."

Meredith H.,/user_details?userid=bIZ1Td1qtUbPuDP8liTEdg,"Brooklyn, NY",2/12/2018,5,"Verde on Smith has my favorite weekend brunch in Brooklyn, hands down. To be honest, I've never eaten anything besides the Smoked Mozzarella Panino, but that sandwich drives me to occasionally go to brunch by myself if I haven't been there in a while. The unlimited deal is pretty standard for Brooklyn, cost-wise (I believe it's an additional $18 ish), and has more drink options than usual since they offer multiple mimosa flavor options/screwdrivers/etc. If you intend on going after 1 pm or have a larger group I would recommend getting a reservation, but it can also be great to pop in for a spontaneous neighborhood brunch. Highly recommend!"
DeLorean S.,/user_details?userid=AQ7CwyWLqbhCuQPNvJH3mQ,"Cypress, TX",7/5/2019,5,came here on my birthday and i loved it! such a cute little spot! they have an inside and outside area and i sat outside for the vibes. we came during brunch so we had bottomless mimosas and i had penne alla vodka. i don't remember a lot of what was around me because i was a little under the influence so in my book that means it was GOOD! i do remember hearing children??? i think there is a daycare right behind the establishment. i also saw the waitress giving us the mimosas give my group of friends a weird look because of the mimosas. if i'm paying for them keep them coming!!!!! other than that i had such a fun time! my boyfriend called there while i was celebrating and they came out with a cake for me! and the guy kissed me on the cheek for my boyfriend. it was such a sweet thing i was so shocked! super nice people i will be back! i think they follow me on instagram now too! also i enjoyed the outside scenery with the flowers and such. such a nice please i will be back!

Tissy R.,/user_details?userid=JeGFMkrvmd91gDM-BeQ2IQ,"Brooklyn, NY",6/12/2015,4,Nice Calm cool place came here for brunch food is really good and I had a mimosa. They have a Unlimited drink special for 17.95 for two hrs but its per person. The waitor could have looked less irritated though.

Katherine W.,/user_details?userid=oeFAs7AGJPXCHlwEX7GeCw,"Brooklyn, NY",4/12/2019,2,"I meant to write this review back in December when it actually happened but you know life happens. When I went here on December 22, 2018 I made a reservation for 2 people at 2pm, my friend and I arrived on time and were seated within 5 mins. Now I've always loved brunching here, the food is amazing and the wait staff are usually very attentive to the point when you do the unlimited drinks they bring you a fresh drink as soon as your previous drink is empty without you having to ask for one. When I came there that afternoon we were seated and ordered our drinks and food. Maybe 10 minutes later when were comfortable and chatting it up, the manager comes over to our table and asks if we would mind switching to another table because of a big party of people coming in that I assume didn't make the proper reservations of how many people would attend. My friend says okay before consulting with me and we move tables. They put us in the back of the restaurant, the last table by the kitchen against the wall, to say I was beyond annoyed is an understatement. When I saw another table across from us leaving, I asked if we could be moved because I didn't like our new table they said no, another big party is coming in. At that point brunch was ruined for me, the food didnt taste as good as usual and drinks werent coming as fast either. The manager didnt even come over and apologize or offer us a comp on fries or something from moving from our initial table. I just think the situation was handled poorly it was not our fault nor problem that the party that came in invited more people than they told the restuarant. I haven't been back since"

Had their omelette with Anaheim peppers and ricotta cheese--had absolutely no flavor to it, and was submerged in a lake of ricotta overflow. Maybe their pancakes/French toast/waffles are better but why bother with cafe Luluc next door?"

Not my first time at Verde and I can't exactly say it's a disappointment nor was it a total success. Unlimited drinks for $17 are definitely a huge plus but they could certainly use friendlier staff. Service was ... Not very friendly, impersonal, cold, and unwelcoming. The food was fine - don't have anything negative to say about the burger and eggs Benedict BUT they killed my bacon!!!! It appeared that the chef took four strips of frozen bacon, threw it on the grill, forgot about it, and let it burn to a crisp so much so that when pulling the strips apart you were left with crumbles. Overall, it was ok .... I'd recommend just for the drinks option."
Minnie M.,/user_details?userid=2sJy0uB033ts2FemcNVZRw,"Brooklyn, NY",10/5/2013,5,The 2nd Best thing on the menu is the chicken florentine..

Michael T.,/user_details?userid=sSFOSIn-lEfpAeZedWFT0Q,"Brooklyn, NY",11/4/2018,1,Let's start from the beginning. My partner and I wanted to have a nice brunch at Verde on Smith St in Brooklyn. It was anything but... We had reservations for 1:15 and wasn't seated until 1:35... The host seated us at a table that had stains on the tablecloth as well as glasses that was drunk out of... I kindly asked for a new tablecloth like everyone else had and he assumed that I didn't want a new one?! The waiter was horrible! It took him 20-30 minutes to take our order and another 10 minutes to give us our drinks... So eventually we was served and given our food. But when my partner asked for another drink the waiter boldly said your not finished your other drink so why do you want another one?! I was thinking oh hell no! I was about to say something but my partner held his composure and I said ask for a manager! So we talked to the manager and nothing was solved unfortunately... But as of now avoid this place at all costs! But I'm not going to let horrible service mess my Sunday Funday up!

Yomaira C.,/user_details?userid=zHr0MP7_Rj5QwD1pRok49Q,"Manhattan, NY",3/7/2016,5,Loved Verde on smith. The service was great. We got there early so we beat the rush and were seated right away. You can choose which brunch cocktails you want for your unlimited choice. I got my traditional steak and eggs and was very pleased with the portion of steak. Everywhere else I've gotten probably more eggs  than steak. I have to try everything else in the menu now ! It's small and cozy with warm decor. Go early or make reservations if they have them this place gets very busy after 12!
Amber F.,/user_details?userid=-RnvpJDY15-bEc4uuu8t1A,"Manhattan, NY",12/8/2018,5,"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. They are freaking amazing . I came for brunch & cannot get enough .

It has a really cute outback garden where we sat. It has a bottomless brunch but it didn't include your meal in the price so we decided against it. I ordered the hamburger and my bf got an omelet. I am a burger lover but would not order this one again. It was a weird texture. However, my boyfriends omelet was really good and the mimosas were really tasty.

I will definitely be back for brunch but probably when its warmer so I can sit outside.  I probably will come and try dinner as well."

The food is fantastic too. I especially recommend the French toast and the burger. Their Rosemary potatoes are delicious as well as the Italian sausage. Definitely worth the trip from Manhattan, and an obvious choice if you're in Brooklyn."

Venus R.,/user_details?userid=MI_n23JDNj2nq3CHpicOvQ,"River Edge, NJ",5/19/2015,4,"Came here like 2 weeks ago for my sisters graduation, the menu looked ok, I wasn't really impressed with the menu items. Then the waiter came and told us the specials. As appetizers we got an eggplant lasagna and stuffed mushrooms they were both great. My meal I ordered shrimp, lobster and scallops al Diablo I wasn't too fond of it. It was ok, my sister raved about her stuffed chicken, my nieces ordered something simple like Cesar salad with grilled chicken, and the chicken was amazing tasted really fresh. My boyfriend had a coconut martini and it was so delicious, and me and my sister had a lychee martini also very good. I liked the drinks better then the food honestly. But they do have happy hour buy u have to be sitting at the bar to get it!"

Sade M.,/user_details?userid=lsXzWXii7N3Z_Fs807icBQ,"Elmont, NY",6/9/2014,4,Made a reservation here for brunch after my friend raved about it as a cute spot for me and my beau to attend for for Sunday brunch. Fast forward we make it 15 mins late for the reservation and the hostess told us they still had a table reserved for us. We were then greeted by our waiter who didn't introduce himself he immediately took our drink order.. We ordered the steak and eggs with French toast to share . Super yum until my beau found a hair in his potatoes...bummer. Our waiter never came back to check on us after he put the order in. Luckily another near by waiter was promptly servicing us keeping the drinks flowing...score. The Decor was very  Victorian which I liked. It also has a outdoor seating area. I would recommend.

And the waiter never bothered to refill our bread until we asked him to when we asked about our entrees. The restaurant seemed to have a nice crowd so obviously, there are local folks who like it.

However, the service was mediocre to say the least.  It was three of us and for some reason they had to take ONE chair away from the table to make it a 3 person table even though it s 4 top table. They did it to another customer as well and he was perplexed.  So me and my girlfriends tried to somehow understand why they were doing this but the owner explain they were very busy - hello I am looking around there were only 4 tables being serviced how are you busy right now. Anyways, moving on - here comes our lovely attitude fill waiter who for some reason the owner defended when he should have been corrected. We told him we couldn't understand why they couldn't move us to another table - he proceeded to make a joke that was NOT funny saying ""well what is the problem I can give you the other table and switch and it still be the same table"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So I told him - well it seems he doesn't care about his tip.  He had an attitude and his name was Luis. They was absolutely nothing pleasant about him - I would have rather have one of the other serves which were REALLY nice. One of them brought us our drinks and he practically pushed him out to take the drinks from him. He was rude and didn't have any customer service skills whatsoever. As a owner you should be able to correct your employees not let them act however they want - your business is a representation of yourself and since you approve of him as a waiter you lost and will loose plenty of customers.  I do not recommend this place and will not go back."

And in his condescending tone told us that they would come before. And guess what...Yup! They came AFTER the meal. The ketchup came before anything (the water, drinks and meal) strange.

Nadine H.,/user_details?userid=JO-yGiU9EhRajpqyMEt-Ng,"Brooklyn, NY",5/20/2016,1,"I have been going to Verde for brunch for years with no problems. I was appalled at my most recent experience there. I made a reservation for brunch for three people. Unfortunately, we hit traffic and were running no more than 10 minutes late. Out of consideration I called ahead to let the host/owner know of the situation and was told rudely that he could not hold the reservation. Then I was told to come and if there was a table, he would seat us. So being that I'm 8 months pregnant and hungry, my friends and I decided to take our chances. When we arrived, not only was the host/owner rude again, he wanted us to sit in the freezing cold outside. When I asked how long it would be for a indoor seat, he refused to tell me. What kind of restaurant owner turns away patrons who had a reservation and a pregnant woman???"

The manager seemed to be afraid to manage the party currently there and tell them that their 2 hours of brunch and bottomless mimosas were up 30 mins ago. We literally had to speak to the manager about 4 times before he gained enough courage to ask the table ""how much longer will you be here?"" Fortunately they finally said they were leaving now. Apparently they do not honor reservations here so be prepared to wait regardless. We were finally seated and eating after 3pm. I had the Spanish omelette which was nothing special. The potatoes it came with were dry and only tolerable after drowning them in ketchup. Even though they seated us late we had to go back and forth with the server to honor the 2 hour bottomless mimosas we paid for since they tried to cut it short. Needless to say, we will NOT be revisiting the establishment. The food was far too average to deal with the bad customer service and wait."

Overall we had a great experience, but I believe they may want to explore the menu. It appeared things were inexpensive, but with a lot of two-tops, it lacked enough ""shareable items."" The menu is dominated by pasta items that appear small and then larger plates. A meat + cheese plate would be welcomed  as well as some crostini options. They were really very affordable for the food, but $7 for a draft beer is a lot in this area of brooklyn. Will try it again soon."

sasha y.,/user_details?userid=9yuOMbrURP4we2CIZVuGdA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/27/2010,3,"This is a decent place, nothing extraordinary or exciting about the food or the drinks or the prices but the staff seems friendly and nice enough and I just saw a sign for an all you can drink brunch - so together that seems like it'd be worth coming back for!"
Sadzia C.,/user_details?userid=HJuwFhGfaWPlamKvKQTNtg,"Brooklyn, NY",2/18/2011,5,"1st of all they changed the lobster feast to 19.95 but it is still worth it. I was very pleased. We had the lobster feast and the chuppa seafood. Oh, my God. Not every one can cook seafood correctly but this place gets it just right. Its fresh its light, well seasoned and not over cooked or undercooked. Perfect, just perfect."

Emma N.,/user_details?userid=LPUqASO0o34mmJooOW97Ow,"New York, NY",1/9/2016,5,Just fantastic! Wandered in here with my husband last night and will definitely return - an impressive list of specials which were difficult to choose from in addition to the regular menu and the service was A1 as others have said
Rose K.,/user_details?userid=2uKNtp2fdGzTaaTZfZdncg,"Brooklyn, NY",5/4/2014,1,"Do not go here. Sorry, they lack any and all basic perception of customer service. Yes, your tables were teeming with patrons but the way my sisters and I were ignored, dismissed, and disregarded left us with a terrible taste in our mouths. I was eager to try the food but now not so much. WOW, the incompetence and rudeness I saw was unspeakable and it was saddening to see that classism, bigotry, and prejudice are alive and kicking... this is my opinion based off of my experience. Really, what was it about us  that prompted this lack of service and caused two staff persons to show us how annoyed they were while serving brunch today? Have things become a bit unmanageable or out of hand with this restaurant? We have had our fill of VERDE exasperated staff lashing out on paying customers (no groupons or deals for us, cold cash only), maybe I can return when management or ownership is changed. Eek! Methinks NOT!"

I hosted my sister's bridal shower brunch for 10 ladies here last June and the owner of Verde on Smith was extremely helpful in setting everything up.   We had a big table in the back garden and ordered off the menu but also did the unlimited drink deal and really enjoyed the afternoon.  Food, drinks, and service was great and they let us stay as long as we wanted (and just paid separately for more drinks...).  I would definitley go back and happily plan another brunch party here!"

I had some pasta with meat sauce, my girl had rigatoni with a tomato sauce and prosciutto, both were pretty fantastic. Would definitely come back here again."

I went for a late birthday brunch and had bloody mary's that were good, but needed to be more spicy, which made them a lot better -- but that is always my preferred method of making things better. The place is swanky inside, very comfortable, cozy, and pretty small. I'll definitely definitely check it out again."

The atmosphere is far less hipster than a lot of other options in the area, which in my opinion, is a nice change of pace. Simple, high quality Italian food, and nicely made cocktails."
Micaela L.,/user_details?userid=Tz_OgtimAKIShlRgNien3Q,"New York, NY",10/30/2011,4,"Verde is a lovely spot in a neighborhood where restaurant options abound.  Their menu is entirely organic and focused on northern Italian cuisine.  I've been several times for dinner and/or drinks, and I've never been disappointed.  Their pastas and cheeses are delicious and their wine list is quite good (and very reasonably priced).  The ambiance is low-key and relaxed, with abundant Edison lights and a lovely back garden in the warm weather."

Christine J.,/user_details?userid=m1CKoHqUk2NTqb-ntonrFQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/6/2012,4,"I had dinner here with a friend using a groupon recently.  The food was really excellent.  We shared the burrata with prosciutto (amazing), the crispy gnochhi with broccoli rabe (also amazing) and a chicken dish that didn't stand out but certainly wasn't bad.  The restuarant is very pretty and the service was friendly and attentive."

Tamara F.,/user_details?userid=zQ9Vqn5Dz5DcI23ZirhkvQ,"Brooklyn, NY",6/3/2012,4,"I've been to Verde three times now and can say that I like this place and don't know why I don't go here more often. The food is good, the outdoor patio is lovely, and it's pretty easy to make a reservation here. The service can be a little slow but I don't particularly mind a long drawn out dinner. Menu favorites include beef carpaccio, crab cake appetizer special, spinach and gorgonzola salad, salmon entree, and filet over arugula entree. I haven't ordered a pasta yet but will next time and hopefully will remember to update."

Andrea A.,/user_details?userid=vmSJi30ajfc2GzdiCydYOA,"Philadelphia, PA",8/20/2012,4,"Went here with some friends for brunch and I am completely baffled as to why it was empty.  My companions were late and I was able to sit right away and they brought water without my even having to ask.  We got the unlimited brunch cocktails and they were refilled even before we had finished the previous ones.  I got eggs benedict and the eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was deliciously creamy.  As a bonus, while the menu says the unlimited drinks are only served for 2 hours, they were definitely generous with that.  I'll definitely go back!"
Eddie N.,/user_details?userid=-wcZMYhQY9XFYPFzB4eKEA,"Brooklyn, NY",10/15/2012,4,"It was a planned day with a list of 5 bars, my girlfriend and I had the Idea to go bar hopping in Brooklyn, being that we hardly go out in The BK area. As we walked by Verde, we realized how cozy it was in there, not to mention they had a board outside letting their customers know about the happy hour, which really got our attention quick. We walked in and while it was very small place it was elegant, inviting and very relaxed. The service was great and the bartender would go around checking on her guess every few minutes. It was nice and quiet and dimmed lights. It felt very nice being in there good to take a person on a first date, it was sophisticated but not over the top where you would have to where dressy cloths. While Verde was not on our list to go that night it sure made it to our future places to visit."
Natasha B.,/user_details?userid=O6icScscctSydEagp5-z7g,"Brooklyn, NY",1/24/2014,4,"This has quickly become one of my brunch faves (can't comment on dinner but heard it's great as well).  The restaurant  is pretty small and can get crowded pretty quickly.  That being said, I've noticed there is a garden in the back so I would assume there is additional seating during summer months.  The decor is standard but has a little bit of a romantic flair so its good for a date or an outing with friends.  On to the good part - the brunch!  Food is DELICIOUS and served in nice sized portions so you don't leave hungry.  They also have a variety of brunch cocktails which I like since I get tired of the standard mimosa.  Service is average and although the servers aren't always super friendly, they get the job done in terms of getting the food out and keeping my glass filled.  The best part is that brunch menu is also served on Fridays - you can't beat it!"

Anthony R.,/user_details?userid=sUnA9bN6CmluPfQ_Dabb-Q,"White Plains, NY",10/1/2012,1,This is an UNFRIENDLY GROUPON  ESTABLISHMENT!!   i went in on Friday night ordered a glass of wine off their specials. After ordering a steak I presented my groupon now to the bartender.  She got  real nasty and said my wine was not on special since i had a groupon.  After ordering the steak the owner comes over and tells me he is out of steaks for the evening so I switched to the tuna.  He also says that there was a 2 person minimum to use the groupon now but he would make an exception this time.   I reread my groupon now and nowhere does it state that it was a 2 person minimum.  I showed it to the bartender and the owner comes running over screaming that he owns the restaurant and not groupon!     So I got up and walked out after driving a half hour to come to this restaurant.   I found a nice little cuban place up the street where i had a very nice meal.
Anna G.,/user_details?userid=r4iNeX0B8I8jBWj29aAP7g,"Seattle, WA",5/2/2010,1,"I'm pretty shocked by how many positive reviews this restaurant has received. I've been to many restaurants on Smith Street and have enjoyed most of them, but I have no desire to revisit this one. The servers were overly attentive when I was waiting for my boyfriend to arrive but once he arrived, we had to grab their attention every time we needed something. We shared the roasted beet appetizer, which tasted OK but would have been better if served warm. I ordered the scallop and sea urchin pasta, which was what I expected, except the scallops were shredded and cooked in the sauce. Why wouldn't they keep the scallops whole? Seemed very odd and it left me wanting more. But the worst crime was my BF's dish: the tuna. The only reason he ordered it is because he read some good reviews about it, but what they call a  ""white bean puree"" was just a bland mush of undercooked, underseasoned beans. There is no way this dish is worth $24. They also tried to charge me $11 for a cocktail when all the drinks on their cocktail menu were advertised as $10."
Liza p.,/user_details?userid=_iVKre6AdHGlNh2Yd0jMAg,"Brooklyn, NY",3/29/2013,1,"After speaking privately with the owner and being willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that maybe he didn't realize we'd JUST paid the check when he asked us to leave, I've come to the conclusion that this guy is just as awful, patronizing, and rude as we thought he was at first. He insists that we wanted to stay at the restaurant an ""unlimited amount of time"" -- who would even do that?! -- says I ""threatened"" him with a Yelp review, and said that if I don't like his response, I can delete my review and he'll delete his. Sorry Cono, that's not how this works. You're the one running a business who has a reputation on the line; I'm just a former customer of your restaurant who had such an awful experience there that I'll make sure everyone I know is aware of exactly why Verde isn't worth a visit."

brb b.,/user_details?userid=XVijwtIS35MBtdvFNj8lbw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/24/2013,3,I think that this place is overpriced. Simple pasta dishes cost at least $14. My pasta wish shrimp and scallops was mediocre considering it was $18. I think the only reason it tasted decent was because they put a lot of sauce on the pasta. I wouldn't say the food was terrible it's just that it wasn't worth the price in my opinion.

Elizabeth K.,/user_details?userid=EyqlaR7-CBIwSF5psDOecA,"Alexandria, VA",5/21/2012,2,"Just 'ehh' - underwhelming, especially given the price. Service was fine...didn't tell us specials until we asked. Free olives and bread were a plus. I'd go back if if they had a good happy hour special..but not for dinner."
Shayana C.,/user_details?userid=J7G6mCGS9P7NWd2L-TzHUw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/16/2014,5,"the french toast, the bottomless drink sprecials, the lobster shrimp clam platter, the steak and eggs, the potatoes,  the burgers, and the service deserves 5 stars. the garden is very beautiful in the summer, but be mindful that business picks up during the summer brunch days so prepare to wait."
Ian A.,/user_details?userid=G2bLdlRYOV6BtjAgmfWQug,"Brooklyn, NY",3/5/2011,4,Went here a few weeks ago and had an excellent filet mignon and steamed muscles. It was busy but they didn't rush you out of the place. A nice place to grab a nice meal. I will be going to Verde on Smith again soon.
Elise C.,/user_details?userid=HcZ1Ewf0TWtmmz7EU84z4g,"Brooklyn, NY",3/13/2011,5,"Verde's is a very welcome addition to Smith Street's restaurant row!! I've lived in Cobble Hill for years and have seen restaurants come and go. The Lobster feast was delicious as were the baked clams and chocolate dessert. Great menu ,especially for brunch and  the prices are most affordable.  The staff is very accomodating and the music adds a special touch to the overall  ambience. So glad to learn that they now deliver to the surrounding neighborhood."
Tasha E.,/user_details?userid=SeHoLEQ98btvBDn6UtcOhg,"Brooklyn, NY",3/18/2012,2,"Went with two friends. One had asked for her steak medium rare. It came well done and had to be sent back. I had the tuna whichI I found tepid and inedible and Im not a food snob. The tuna is advertised as fresh but it had no flavor and was likely frozen. One friend had the shrimp scampi which was pretty good but the cream sauce was heavy as opposed to ""light"". I wont go back."
Ingrid H.,/user_details?userid=P3eEAli2HqQrTMigO4EALw,"Brooklyn, NY",5/18/2012,5,"Amazing food! Will accommodate dishes for vegetarians. Staff is extremely friendly and attentive. Decor is modern, while still being comfortable. You feel right at home sitting with your friends at a table for dinner, or just having a drink at the bar. ALWAYS amazing specials and deals through facebook, which I LOVE! Weather is nice enough to start enjoying their amazing outdoor garden! Highly recommend! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!"
Jessica R.,/user_details?userid=zvIylWlI9IZ3CKGRkZHYAw,"Brooklyn, NY",6/12/2013,5,Firstly let me outline I am a picky eater. It is very rare that I say I enjoyed everything we ordered. However I have been to Verde twice now and honestly really enjoyed everything. We stated with Gorgonzola salad! Delish! And then had muscle spaghetti. EVEN BETTER! If you haven't tried this restaurant take my advice and go there. The staff are great and the food is even better. I can't wait to go back.
Jessica D.,/user_details?userid=qtC0RQp4Xi6A-qo9FDfDsA,"Brooklyn, NY",4/9/2013,5,"I love this restaurant and I order their nicoise salad every week!  The atmosphere is chill and elegant, and the back garden is beautiful.  The food is delicious.  Last year I held my birthday party here and they were absolutely amazing.  For any meal or occasion this is a great choice."
Michael G. G.,/user_details?userid=Xzh-OIaXv2pXNVqAwYpjGQ,"Brooklyn, NY",5/20/2010,5,"Finally a Fine Italian Restaurant with Italians in the kitchen. That's big to me, there are so many so-called Italian Restaurants around, it's good to find one with true Italian home cooking.  The Food was Great. The atmosphere was great. This is my new Favorite Spot."
Mbt T.,/user_details?userid=_eevWAYqZy2Si8Xd0eJUHA,"Brooklyn, NY",6/5/2010,4,"My friends and I really enjoyed our dinner here.  The service was prompt, and our food was delicious!  The items on the menu are very affordable (~$10 pasta dishes) however the beer cost more money than I expected.  The sign in the front advertised $3 beer and $4 wine, but that price turned out to be for the bar only.  (That was one of the main reasons we decided to eat there!  We were all going to enjoy a few glasses of wine with our dinner, but couldn't spend $10/glass thus had one beer instead.)  Aside from that, we all liked our food and will probably return!  It has a nice atmosphere and an affordable food menu - two plus-points for a restaurant worth revisiting...at least in my book!"
E F.,/user_details?userid=acSoo6CYXmW1h-S8uTWUAg,"Brooklyn, NY",2/15/2011,1,"Went for Valentines Day and my husband, who has a stomach of steel, got food poisoning today (next day). Margharitas were wierd and the pasta dish our guest had was left uneaten. Fish and spinach salad were good. The other guest had an OK steak that was served with no care for presentation. Given other reviews below this was  disappointing. Given husband's inabiity to go to work due to food poisoning, will never go back."
Lila E.,/user_details?userid=_Kfm5CrIKav6tw-srMnPng,"Brooklyn, NY",7/3/2011,5,"This lovely restaurant is like a slice of Italy. It's not fast food or a cookie cutter menu.The ingredients are fresh, delicate, authentic and beautifully arranged on the plate. We travel to Italy often and know the difference. The staff was lovely and attentive. Try the appetizer with beets, leeks and cheese...delicious."
P. S.,/user_details?userid=TcJfZ8yqG-GE1Rm8_DKEkQ,"New York, NY",3/24/2012,5,"I've been to this restaurant 6 times now.  Last night was the first time on a Friday night and was so impressed I felt needed a review.  The food was very good with interesting flavors and none of it too heavy (standouts were the mussels appetizer and the lamb special).  Tiramisu and sorbet desserts excellent.  Service was fine even when they got very busy and the manager comped us dessert wine.  One of the reasons I like this place is that the room is designed so that you can hear each other talk even when it is crowded, unlike a lot of places which get incredibly noisy.  The garden in the back is very comfortable for outdoor dining in good weather."
Syl S.,/user_details?userid=CfhCz4lvSbWU6v_zJXMrrg,"Brooklyn, NY",4/22/2012,4,"I've been to Verde at least 5 or 6 times at this point and they have become my favorite Italian restaurant in the area.  The brunch is equally as good as the dinner!  You have to get their Mimosas!  They do a few different flavors and use fresh squeezed juice for them, not the canned stuff.  The burrata is delicious and so are the pastas.  The waitstaff is very friendly and accommodating.  Eating at the bar is nice because the bartendar is cool.  They have a garden out back which I can't wait to try now that the weather is getting nicer.  Very solid, good food for the price.  Place is nice but can get very loud.  Not quiet and romantic but very inviting."
Gary B.,/user_details?userid=jbqWiS2l4VZBj_aVHibpaQ,"Rhinebeck, NY",4/29/2012,4,"Four of us had dinner at Verde last night, and we quite liked it.  It was a civilized atmosphere with nice lighting and a comfortable noise level.  The food was very tasty and very reasonably priced.  Management was especially kind and considerate.  I had an issue with a gift certificate, and the manager took care of it politely and professionally.  I will definitely return!"
Alana K.,/user_details?userid=UZuNV6Nsrp2GkjPOsuti3g,"Brooklyn, NY",5/3/2012,5,"Verde rocks my world. The food is always, always delicious. Like insanely delicious. It always seems like the food is much higher quality than the restaurant appears because the decor is plain jane but I am fine with that. I've had the seafood and pasta, shrimp scampi with saffron risotto, broccoli rabe, a fish one time... each time it feels like I am at a high high high end restaurant in Manhattan. One piece of advice though -- for dessert, only the Tiramisu is made in-house. It's delicious. The other desserts are brought in and are not so hot. Also Verde participates with Groupon Now and many other deal sites (make sure you find one before you head over), so getting the check is always as pleasurable as the food I am paying for!"
Jody K.,/user_details?userid=uGzz9vXadg21Wdo01H4Xng,"Brooklyn, NY",1/18/2013,5,"I have been here several times for brunch and dinner - The food and service is always fantastic.  I like that there are choices on the menu and not the current trend of a handful of  dishes to choose from (ahem, neighboring restaurants).  The unlimited mimosa brunch deal is worth a visit.  There is never a line here, it's truly a  neighborhood gem.  Sometimes there is live music which is always entertaining.  My favorite dishes thus far have been the Buffalo Mozzarella, French Toast,  and Kobe Burger.  The food is a generous portion if you wish to share your appetizers."
Ralph M.,/user_details?userid=OnCP1IWpo4HjUgsJJo-m6A,"Brooklyn, NY",10/13/2010,5,"Honestly, I had no idea this restaurant existed for the first three months it was open. I had been going next door for brunch for a couple weeks and the menu peaked my interest so I came back on a friday night. Best decision I made since moving to the neighborhood. They have a great space, Very inviting decor, nice bar, a great backyard, and a very attentive staff. The manager/host and owner are eager to please and the wait staff looks happy to serve (which having worked in restaurants through college I can tell you isn't always the easiest thing to do). I have been here about half a dozen times now and I've sampled most of the entrees and can say I really haven't had a bad meal yet. The lobster is a great value, the pastas are all tasty and even the classic dishes are very creative (try the crispy gnocci!). Definitely one of the lesser known gems on smith."

A truly elegant museum with classic European cuisine, Vernonika is an elegant, formal restaurant serving great food and cocktails to a very trendy crowd that you would normally expect to find in a far more casual restaurant. The service is impeccable as you would expect to find at this price point. For once the food equals the scene and the beautiful room."

It was spacious in comparison with manhattan standard. The bread was warm and yummy. The oysters were fresh. The lobster omelette was pretty average, maybe other entrees would be better. For the dessert, the chocolate cake was delicious, but not memorable. Overall, I would come here for the vibe, but not so much the food."

We originally intended to get some champagne to pay for the privilege to see the impressive architecture and interior design, but found ourselves lingering for hours enjoying cocktails and snacks that each seemed to tell a story in a film noir voice with the mystery, intrigue, and invitation of Wes Anderson proportions. Definitely get the Reserve Martini Tray or any one of there espresso martini innovations. The martini tray is a one of a kind cocktail experience, that doesn't need repeating... the espresso martinis however seemed to invite friends and back-ups such that the bottom was never found."
Reshard R.,/user_details?userid=6h_eC-lErGTdnWR_OynVPA,"Brooklyn, NY",2/16/2023,5,"There is a reason places are great and people gravitate toward them like bees to pollen. This place is a feast for the eyes as well as an after work drinks location with the best fries at the bar. Is it pricey...sure but you are paying for the experience as well. The hey I'm having drinks in a place that looks like a movie set with other glamorous people. I'm living a NYC experience.  For anyone wanting to dine here, please take the reservation process seriously. They do. And ensure that you impress your guests that you can score a table. Worth every moment to go into a place where the bartenders know your name if you are a regular.  No food photos or drink photos because yes it will be great, but they are not the only reason that you will go."

From the moment you walk in, everything is just absolutely gorgeous. Veronika doesn't just rely on her looks, what she's got to offer is just as good. The drinks we had were perfectly crafted, and we enjoyed being able to watch the bartenders do their thing. We ordered fries and a lobster roll. It was a very small roll, but I expect smaller portions in places like this. Size doesn't matter in this case, because the freshness and flavor was 10/10. Probably one of my favorite lobster rolls I've had. The service was incredible, and no pretentiousness whatsoever. I can't wait to go back!"

Nikkia A.,/user_details?userid=YYv03yvEhAOxE-Wq6wJBAQ,"New York, NY",2/2/2023,5,"To echo the sentiments of many, dining here is an absolute experience. Are you looking for a place that still holds mystery in a world full of restaurant vlogs? The Veronika still holds that air. Greeting at the door? Check. Walking up a sweeping staircase? Check. Hassle free coat check? Check. Walking through an immaculate bar with the perfect mood lighting to be led to the dramatic yet well spaced out dining room? Big check! If you couldn't tell by my checklist, the Veronika has it all. My experience the past couple of times I have dined here has even prompted me to consider membership! The vibes are that immaculate. With a well thought out dining menu as well as a great variety in both their cocktail and wine list, Veronika has something for everyone. They were even able to provide viable offerings and substitutions for someone in my party who was gluten free (here's looking at you fresh gluten free bread served with their usual mini croissants!) My recommendations? For appetizers, the scallop and kampachi and the tuna tartare are amazing and refreshing to start. I'd go for any of their steak dishes for an entree - the ribeye is especially flavorful - and they all come with delicious frites. And lastly, you cannot leave until you've tried their Martini and caviar potato offering as a cocktail. Long story short, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the Veronika - if you can get an 8pm reservation when the space seems to really come alive, you won't be disappointed. And don't forget to take advantage of your museum discount as well."

On to the food, the menu has a variety of food, we tried the tuna tartare with uni which was so divine, for entrees we had the chicken which was ok and the salmon which was really tasty. On to dessert, we tried the strawberries and cream and the carrot cake, we probably could have done with 1, but either was we were so excited to try everything. Classy place with beautiful people. Loved everything about it. They also have a really nice cocktail menu as well."

My BF and I came here right at 5 pm on a Sat and snagged the couch right in front of the beautiful  bar. BF had a Gold Rush - he orders this drink quite a lot and said that it was the best version of this drink he had ever had (!). I ordered an espresso martini which was similarly excellent. We also tried the quail eggs (didn't taste too ""quail-y"" , aka it's quite accessible to someone who might be scared to try quail) and munched on some French fries. My advice is to skip Fotografiska (until they have better exhibits) and go straight to Veronika for drinks!"

The waiter apologized and brought the snapper 45 mins later after everyone finished dinner. They charged us for the lobster omelette too. We ordered the caviar martini but they forgot to bring the caviar. We got there at 7 and did not leave till 10:45. Service was so slow. I had to raise my hand to flag our waiter down. Honestly it's the hype and no quality. I would not recommend or go back here again."

It was exactly what I needed after a stressful day at work.  I will definitely be going in again to see Matt and try some other delicious cocktails and I am looking forward to having dinner soon as well.
Jennifer H.,/user_details?userid=wMesVy-YeK571bFeTFcoYA,"New York, NY",1/4/2023,5,My friends and I did a walk in on a Wednesday night after we learned that you either need a reservation or a membership to get into the Chapel bar around the corner. We were able to do standing room at the bar and eventually sat down after some people left. The drinks were done really well and the staff was great. We came after dinner so we didn't order any food and the atmosphere seemed more fitting for drinks anyway. Would definitely return and can see it getting really crowded on popular nights.

Food and cocktails were great ! Highly recommend. The restaurant is located inside of the Fotografiska museum. You walk up the stairs after coat check entering a beautiful bar lounge. The chandeliers catches your attention. You can grab a drink before dinner. The service was great. The menu was gorgeous. The tempura oysters and their lobster omelette is a must try !! I had the halibut and boyfriend had their steak. Everything was to perfection.
Tony R.,/user_details?userid=IpGHTfyb5HnrxlcpmrFtrg,"Manhattan, NY",6/30/2022,4,"Veronika has had a change and management and in their chef, and recently reopened.  It gets high marks for the atmosphere, drinks, vibe and service.  The food, however, could use an upgrade.  The breaded chicken (Jager schnitzel) was nothing special.  The mushroom sauce made the dish, though it was too thick for the dish.  The halibut was very good, as was the sorrel sauce.  The market salad was ordinary and skimpy on the dressing.  Strawberries and cream were a winner, as were the cocktails.  Service is excellent -- knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and efficient."
Isabella P.,/user_details?userid=oGQENgvftNwYph5BgFjTUw,"Los Angeles, CA",7/10/2022,4,"I have been trying to go there since 2020 but they closed because of covid on the day of my reservation so I was excited to finally be able to make it. The place is absolutely beautiful and everything is really well thought out in terms of the decor but the restaurant still needs to fix a few things in order to match the ambience. Service was def a 3 stars since it felt more like a bar than a luxury experience they are trying to portrait. We had to pour our water the whole dinner and had to chase our server. The host/manager with a large hat  was chilling in the tables with other clients instead of ever looking at us when we were trying to get the attention of someone to order something, it felt like soho house. Drinks took a very long time and we're ok but not great. I did enjoy the presentation of all the food, which was a 4 star for me but could use a little more work - the snapper was over cooked in one side compared to the other. The best part of the meal it was actually the free bread, which is like a croissant and the crudités. It was a nice touch to serve those before hand. The potato caviar with the martini was also very good. Overall I think I would just go back for drinks instead of dinner since you can still enjoy the beautiful atmosphere but wouldn't stress with the service. I hope they incorporate a few more creative additions to the menu going forward."

Chris B.,/user_details?userid=jm0fU3yyQk6TQLefv-8FVA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/9/2023,2,"Restaurant gets a 2 star because the interior is beautiful and the service was decent. While we waited for our table, we ate pierogis and had drinks. The cocktail menu is superb, with a renowned ""martini tray"" served with caviar. The pierogis - not so good. Perhaps because pierogis are known to be cheap, it doesn't make sense to be selling them for $20. I would serve them more moist with caviar and sour cream. Also the cocktail room, which connects to the dining room, had a DJ spinning. The ambiance would be a lot better without that - it was way too noisy. As for the main menu, I honestly thought it was nothing special. The chicken schnitzel was mediocre and the steaks were nothing to die for. We had the strawberry dessert, which I found to be inedible. Overall, I would not return here unless there was severe improvements made to this menu. If you want better food with a similar ambiance, I would suggest Le CouCou."

Every single person we came into contact with was very professional and made us feel welcome. Lucky for us they had a number of vegetarian items on the menu so we shared the vegetarian special of the night and a few sides. The drinks are very good too! We went to the bar right after dinner and we had a great experience. Great drinks, food, atmosphere and great staff....I will definitely return when I'm back in New York."

Mark G.,/user_details?userid=OpdOVw0e_aKz6_xbWQldEA,"New York, NY",12/5/2022,3,"I really wanted to like this place but I felt my veal ""Holstein"" was just a huge letdown.  It was greasy and too heavy, not what you want for thinly pounded veal.  The rest of the group liked their mains (the chicken, and lobster omelet) but I didn't try them.  For $72 I expected way more for my main.  The dessert was good and the ambiance is as well but wouldn't trust going back after my experience."
Fronk V.,/user_details?userid=x-wpM4wMVHtP9e0Yd5-f0g,"Asylum Hill, Hartford, CT",2/16/2023,1,Tables are so close together you literally can't take your jacket off without hitting the person nearby
Kelly C.,/user_details?userid=YiiK0E9kBm7fu1pV1Li8RA,"New York, NY",1/31/2023,4,So - ambiance A +.  Service A++.  Felt like old Hollywood.  Drinks A+.  Amazing wine recommendations from a new wine steward/sommeliere ... Food - and we went crazy with food - major hits or major misses.  Friend raves about two of the oyster appetizers.  I had the beet salad over some cheese something - it was ok - not wow.  Probably would not order again.  Friends loved the asparagus salad - and the salad with hearts of palm was ok.  OMG the bread - best bread we ever had.  Insane flavor and density.  Best bread in the world.  Red Snapper for two - flavorless and a bit dry -   Veal lacked seasoning and slightly overcook.  Porterhouse for two sensational.  Pass on the mushrooms but potato puree was wonderful - creme carmel flambed tableside is top five desserts ever.  Overall great experience -  worth the investment.

Ava R.,/user_details?userid=p6b-3DPNkIU7lTw73y7Y3A,"New York, NY",12/8/2022,1,"We went to Bar Veronika last night at our reservation time at 8:45. We were told to wait by the bar while they got our table ready. 20 minutes went by and we still were not sat. We then were told that a group of people had sat themselves at our table. They told us that they asked them to move and they refused so they didn't want to ask again and make them ""uncomfortable""? Although we were the ones who had a reservation? They said they were fully committed for the rest of the night and offered to take us to the Crown Bar next door to have a drink while we wait for a new table. We take the offer and end up waiting another 30 minutes for them to come and bring us our coats and say we are unable to dine with them. It was the most bazaar experience. They did not try to make up for the situation and had tricked us into going to the place next door so we would not be allowed back into the restaurant. Very unfortunate as we were very excited to try this place but was a big let down. If you were ever planning to dine at this restaurant I would reconsider"

Kelly A.,/user_details?userid=4pat4CScggn6Zznm2JeyNA,"FL, FL",9/18/2022,1,Very nice restaurant with great decor but ultimately lacking in service. The team doesn't seem like they want to be there and actually make recommendations for drinks or dinner. Everything seems like an inconvenience to them. The food itself is great and so are the drinks. But we were told to leave our table bc another party was waiting and then we went to the bar to finish the drinks we had ordered at our actual table during dinner and again we were told we had 30 mins before someone else needed those seats. Very bizarre experience & a rude way to treat customers who have reservations and are ordering drinks.

Gabriel C.,/user_details?userid=5DJkgYZRKJMI6iDWTnUNkg,"Financial District, San Francisco, CA",2/8/2023,3,"im genuinely sad to say I had a very disappointing experience at what is probably my favorite restaurant in crown heights. had reservations for 8pm on a wednesday, but wasn't seated till 8:30 even though there were several tables available as far as i could see. even if they were holding tables for later reservations, does the fact that we were waiting 30mins upon our RESERVATION not take precedence? and whilst waiting, we ordered two drinks at the bar and those took 20mins to arrive. the salad we ordered once we finally sat was inedible. We watched as it was taken back, tasted by the chef, who was repulsed by it too. our drinks were good and the steak was okay, but after recommending what i thought was one the best restaurants in brooklyn to several friends, it really did feel like a let down. no fault to the staff or the chefs but i don't know. im just... saddened by the whole experience."

Tastefully decorated, loved the bar seating which had comfort in mind with coat hooks and a foot rest ! Great music selection and lighting. Someone who seemed to be the owner was very accommodating. The bartender was also very cool and made his recommendations was on point with his mixology. They have a happy hour from 5-7pm. We had the salmon tartare which was amazing ! Layered with radishes,a tart seasoning and crispy onions it was perfect and fresh. The Arden burger was also a hit. the fries were perfect , loved the kimchi seasoning on the burger. I would have liked to just order the burger off the dinner menu without the beer for the lesser price but was told I couldn't do that. Will definitely be back."

After much back and forth, we had the happy hour oysters, Sea Bass Crudo, the Pork Belly, the Brick Chicken, Roasted Carrots and the Lemon tart. All of them were delicious and on point. Will definitely be back to try something from their open fire pit (pork chop or steak)."

I had the bone marrow to start (which was a special that night) and then had a GIANT! porkchop. The drinks were good too but next time I need to save room to try some dessert. Definitely coming back.

Alyvia P.,/user_details?userid=pnU0L7MWAKf-FlITzfVNxg,"Brooklyn, NY",11/11/2022,5,"We have been walking by for months and finally stopped in for dinner. What a wonderful surprise! We loved the menu so much that we almost ordered every appetizer. The pork belly melts in your mouth and should not be missed. Same goes for the beet carpaccio salad. It was a flavor and texture explosion from the first bite- tangy and sweet, soft and crunchy. My husband ordered the pork chop and was not disappointed, as he is usually upset with portion sizes, this did not disappoint. Our drinks were also delicious, especially my Negroni with a special gin. The service was impeccable. We can't wait to go back- haven't stopped talking about it all day!"
Eric N.,/user_details?userid=viz8Zp7WI7cwXdirR2YlUA,"San Francisco, CA",1/12/2023,5,Excellent restaurant! I personally love the pork chop and when they have the tuna as a special.

Mattea F.,/user_details?userid=2BwoDpKDXSqA9rAFlLevsw,"Astoria, New York, NY",3/15/2023,5,This place has a chill and nice atmosphere. My group was in for happy hour and I think we tried almost all of the cocktails. The Pink Flamingo and The Low Down were my favorites. We shared some apps and the Shrimp and Crispy Pork belly were both delectable. This is a great spot to come in after work and get some drinks and good food.
Lynslee M.,/user_details?userid=F0hHDBmnVxo5fqQLPRHHFg,"Brooklyn, NY",8/25/2022,5,My friend was visiting and suggested we eat at this place and it did not disappoint! They've only been open for 3 months but the service was unmatched. I don't think I've ever been to a place where the owner was so involved and accommodating and also brought the chef out to us at the end of the meal. The ambiance was amazing and the servers were kind and prompt. We really loved every single dish we had and none disappointed. We ate at estela yesterday and I gotta say Arden was overall better for me in terms of flavor and portion! Definitely will be coming back here and as a regular. Thanks Arden

He was so helpful in regards to questions about the menu. As a party of 4, we ordered about 7 dishes and it was plenty enough for us. My favorite would be the charred asparagus as well as the ahi tuna.  I would definitely recommend this place for a casual dinner with some friends or on a date as well!!"
Evita R.,/user_details?userid=yYGA5MrxxokOons471iEUA,"Monroe Township, NJ",11/7/2022,5,"The place has an excellent location on the corner of busy intersection and looks like it's been there a while but not so with their New American menu. My first dine out experience in Brooklyn since the pandemic. It did not disappoint. Started with the appetizers of grilled marrowbone and the pork belly. Yes, it was that good - we had another order of the marrowbone. Mains were individual bowls of bouillabaisse and linguine with clams. Dessert was a lemon curd tart with fresh raspberries and blueberries. It's definitely worth a trip back to go through the interesting menu. Their cocktails to start were pretty good. Try ""the painkiller"" - works!"

Unfortunately, the customer service was very poor aka very rude. She clearly hated her job and didn't want to be there resulting in a terrible experience. They also ran out of appetizer options late afternoon. The protein to entire entree ratio was very small. The flavors of both dishes were nonexistent. Maybe it was a one off since everyone else loved it. I sure do hope it was a one off.."

Jasbir S.,/user_details?userid=GdBCuvugdWWRrusPZkFm9Q,"Town of Oyster Bay, Long Island, NY",3/24/2023,1,I've enjoyed eating at Downtown manhattan location but food at this location is not good. I had the chicken touk (cubes) with brown rice today. The 50% of chicken was undercooked so I ended up throwing it out. The rice were too dry and overall it was not a good meal. I think food at cava is better. I'll try something else next time and hope it was just one time thing.

Chuck P.,/user_details?userid=lmEUPIf1nHb0opydm6Rsug,"New York, NY",1/8/2023,4,"NYE Dinner review: formerly known as Mission Chinese now is a new establishment called Casino, the interior and ambiance is perfect for date night or just dinner with friends. They have front bar room and dining room in the back. I booked a last minute reservation for NEY and they were able to accommodate. Their staffs were friendly, start off with their appetizer crudo and fries, then we also hard 3 meals to split between, the clams pasta and the seafood lobster dish was my favorite, however the duck was overcooked but the flavor was good. Overall, I would still recommend this place."
Lily G.,/user_details?userid=tfjhtdxDuD9L-neA3IPnGw,"New York, NY",3/20/2023,5,Delicious and elegant. Perfect spot for my one-on-one catch-up with my girl friend. Lovely martinis and oysters!
Kathy S.,/user_details?userid=dXNkc-DzRh1CghZ6oR_9PQ,"Arlington, VA",12/28/2022,3,"The food was okay! Our server was very nice and service and food were relatively fast. On many of the dishes the sauces were a 4/5 but for instance the duck pate i had on the TOURNEDOS ROSSINI (2/5) wasn't the best i've had. My husband had the pasta with clam (3/5) and it was meh also. The NDUJA BREAD is a must! The ambiance was perfect for date night tho! Bottom line would I come again? Probably not, but it was a nice ambiance"
Sarah F.,/user_details?userid=jK6Be_4tjw986UvJ-pqRMQ,"Brooklyn, NY",2/15/2023,5,I made a reservation here for dinner with friends who were in town. I wanted us to have dinner somewhere where the food was good and the atmosphere was fun and Casino hit the mark on both points. The food was high quality and the menu was a little different than what I've come to expect at NYC Italian restaurants. The service was incredible. Very attentive and friendly. It all felt like a modern take on old school New York. Can't wait to return!
Alex W.,/user_details?userid=fTzRXdPFETiTccAhMQPqfw,"Midtown East, New York, NY",2/11/2023,5,Love the ambience here. The waitstaff was so accommodating and friendly. Love the cheese appetizer and Butter lettuce salad!

Will only let you in if he thinks you're ""worth it"" meaning chic and rich looking. He refused to take names down on list but immediately did for others. The food is mediocre at best. Don't waste your time and money here."

Chris L.,/user_details?userid=Z6pp-qJdorSS4iyY5ZiyVw,"Brooklyn, NY",2/12/2023,5,"This place held up to the hype. We shared the falafel and hummus and ordered a variety of dishes. The pita was fluffy and warm, hummus was delicious, all of the mains were good but the lamb was particularly impressive. Drinks were also good. Price for food quality was very good."

It was so creamy and fluffy.   Also, the bread that they used in his dish was soo good.  They had so many yummy looking things on the menu, I would try for lunch or dinner next time I am in town."

Ahiliya N.,/user_details?userid=34FGjFX1uogxA68pcMiglg,"Brooklyn, NY",10/21/2022,5,"Love, love this place!!! I came here for brunch a few months ago, and then just went back for dinner. The hummus is out of this world and actually some of the best I've had. I also REALLY love the labneh - super fresh and herby. For brunch, I got the shakshuka which was delicious. I got the arayes for dinner, which are little minced lamb pita pockets with a spicy salad and some tahini on the side. DELICIOUS! I can't recommend this place enough for good and flavorful Middle Eastern food."

Megan L.,/user_details?userid=jfEhQLu2hahKt3JahaKNrg,"Largo, FL",1/13/2023,5,Oh WOW. This place does not skimp on their serving sizes. The hummus and pita were the perfect starter and the pierogis were piping hot (we preferred them cold actually because you get more of the flavor). We went with the arayes and shipudim which were each amazing. The chicken was crazy flavorful and tender. Definitely recommend.
Kate N.,/user_details?userid=qc-N766KCKZCzBItzxUB9A,"Brooklyn, NY",8/31/2022,5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. Each time I come here the food is always fresh, and the service is excellent. My favorite thing to order is the Greek salad, as well as their excellent hummus that comes with pita bread and pickles. This is definitely a must try in Brooklyn, you will not be disappointed!"
Cynthia T.,/user_details?userid=YvucIgGBLTMNxfyj-Kpbwg,"Brooklyn, NY",8/30/2022,5,"Came here for brunch , we ordered the small plates to start with and the portions were big for the two of us. We ordered the labneh, babagonush, and two others which I forgot the name of but it's in the r photos . For my entree I had the salad and my friend had the borek plate . Both were bigger portions then I would have needed. Food is yummy . Waiter is friendly and attentive . Forgot his name but he's tall with a think blond/brunette hair . Wil definitely return to try other items ! Great day!"

David O.,/user_details?userid=vofH-PetH9N3r5OKihqypQ,"Rolling Hills Estates, CA",1/22/2023,1,Very sub par food. Definitely not worth coming. Salmon was not tasty and all the food is runny. Nice attempt at Israeli food but was a waste of a brunch.

Kinjal P.,/user_details?userid=IKNcjjQAEQxHgGWfZcAjAw,"Manhattan, NY",6/14/2022,5,The waiter sold us in the hummus and so glad he did. It was amazing! So was the arayes!

The 4 small plates for $25 is a must-order, because all of them are outstanding. The matbucha was delicious and slightly spicy, possibly my favorite dish. The tabouli salad was refreshing and delicious. The labaneh was decadent and tasty. The pita was sumptuously thick (and they have whole wheat available on request!) The cauliflower was tasty and generously portioned. The shakshuka was also excellent. The place is busy and has a fun, bustling, Europe-meets-Brooklyn vibe. Reservations recommended because it is very busy during peak hours, although there is open seating at the bar if you're lucky."

We sat at the bar while we waited for our food . Bartender was very nice and attentive ! He made me a recommendation of the drink ""IYKYK"" which was sweet with a hint of nostalgia ! The inside was very calm and very trendy vibes . It is middle eastern inspired as is the menu so i was happy to see that . I order chicken sandwich in a pita with sweet potato fries and hummus . The sandwich was delicious!!! Very flavorful and tasteful . The sweet potatoes were surprisingly very good. The hummus sadly was not good at all to me but I grew up on hummus so I'm very picky with it . None the less it was a very calm environment in Williamsburg . I'll definitely be back soon ! Cheers"
Hannah R.,/user_details?userid=ue2gQxTeJOdLggRsGeOAAw,"New York, NY",1/23/2023,5,"I went here for my birthday dinner and can't recommend enough! For large groups there is a prefixe menu that comes with various appetizers, dips, and mains that give you a good taste of the menu. They were also very accommodating to dietary restrictions and we ended up having a ton of leftovers. There wasn't a dish we didn't like! If you come later at night the atmosphere is awesome - the staff hands out tambourines and people get up and dance to Israeli music. Definitely a birthday dinner I'll never forget."

Maria B.,/user_details?userid=HgMnkPvsWAJJzPt2wmjZSQ,"Hawthorne, NY",1/21/2023,1,After making a reservation more than 3 weeks in advance and was clearly mismanaged by the restaurant and waiting for 30 minutes in 30 degree weather outside we were told to take a table outside or leave (Didn't book an outdoor reservation). Was shocked by the customer service since they accepted the reservation. Other people were waiting more than an hour with a reservation outside as well and treated just as poorly. Unfortunate as they clearly overbooked and chose to treat customers in this way.

Raphael P.,/user_details?userid=7GAXbb9qxzOnicoG0KfQhA,"New York, NY",11/17/2021,4,"Went here with a big group and they seated us despite not having a reservation. Tried a bunch of things, the chicken schnitzel was solid, as was the hummus pierogis and lamb burger. Was not impressed with the cocktails. Overall solid food and they did a good job hosting a big party with no notice. Some of the sidewalk chairs had 0 heat exposure. 3.5 round up to 4, .5 comes from seating a big party with no rez and taking care of us."
Nadine J.,/user_details?userid=sGKK6LgRX_JAKcmELaJcqw,"Brooklyn, NY",4/17/2022,3,"Are you ready for the 411? Here we go...me and bae decided on this little spot for our after-church service brunch spot. Williamsburg was our choice and this little Israeli spot on the corner of Wythe and S 2nd Street! You could hear the multi-cultural music playing inside as the outside diners tapped their feet to the tunes that filtered outside. It felt energetic and inviting so we inquired on seating availability. The hostess was accommodating and was able to seat us in the almost filled cafe. I must say I am always amazed by restaurant decor and loved the NYC styled street light lighting inside the cafe. The noise level was adequate and could have a decent leveled conversation with bae during the whole meal. Now let me tell you about Dana! She was our server and initially I thought she was peppy but soon found out different. We ordered our meal which I felt was a little rushed but it was still fine at the time. I ordered the smoked salmon scrambled. It was tasty but it was a soft-scrambled which turned out to be a little too soft for my taste. I felt the softness of the eggs decreased it's ability to enhance its overall taste. I was a little heavy handed on the salt but felt it was still lacking in taste.  Bae had the French toast with scrambled eggs on the side. He loved his French toast which he said were perfectly made and not dried out yet soft enough even with the syrup added. His eggs tasted better than mine which I believe were due to the harder texture. His fresh fruit was delicious as well. The kiwi was the sweetest of all the fruits. Now let's get back to Dana! She started out pleasant enough but was surprised when she came back to our area and asked the family next to us how they were enjoying the meal and never turned to ask us the same question. Even after I thought she would at some point she never did. She was highly attentive to the other patrons which I clearly observed as compared to us. We never got water which she said she was going to bring, I had to ask for a spoon for my tea which she brought way after the busboy finally brought it to me and brought us the check without asking if there was anything else we wanted.   I wondered if she was rushing us for the table however saw couples and families that were there before us and who were still seated after we left so there goes that theory. At this point we decided to do Dana a favor and leave this establishment which she was clearly trying to make us do. I love visiting different places to eat and this is a spot I would love to come back to and try some different choices but Dana obviously did not want us to come back. We even tipped her to show her no hard feelings! For others I think it's worth a try and see if you have better luck! I would have given this a 4-star but the customer service knocked it down to a 3-star!!"

The pita bread was warm right out the oven. I also had t 12 chairs lamb burger also delicious. I tried my friends pancakes ,they were good. I would definitely come back."

We were a group of 4 and were seated pretty quickly, although the host seated people who came after us first, which wasn't fun to watch in the cold. The food took that annoyance away though--it came fast and straight from the kitchen and was so good (albeit a bit oily, but that's what I was craving that day). The music was on point (house music) which made the entire vibe fun."

First time we went here the server with a short hair was so cold and not even checking us she only came back for the check! Gave it a second try because the food was good and still the other server are also cold and rude! they will give you the TOAST for you to pay first than bringing the food or drink that u ordered!

I've been here twice: for brunch and dinner and I can confidently say that one meal is not better than the other here. For brunch I got the Eggs Siniya, which came with pita and for dinner I got a mediterranean salad. Both were tasty and filling. This place is well-priced too! It's also worth mentioning the $25 special for four small plates, which are easily shareable. Definitely go here... it's worth the hype!"

Hannah D.,/user_details?userid=kPK50O8lcPRl1-RQ2r-OEA,"Nashville-Davidson metropolitan government (balance), TN",10/18/2022,2,"The staff was rude and very pushy about being out on time. I get it, it's brunch and other people have to eat. With that being said, my food came 20 minutes after the rest of the tables which didn't help with the strict timeline we were on. I worked in the service industry for a long time so I'm pretty laid back about my experiences out but every single person we interacted with was rude. Really disappointing since my parents were in town and this is where I decided to take them, on recommendation from a friend. Maybe it was just an off day, but I probably wouldn't recommend this spot to a friend. Food was good-- maybe get it to go."
Sam E.,/user_details?userid=mXlFgy2IDvtfr5e3AdC5tQ,"Los Angeles, CA",5/4/2021,5,"12 chairs cafe is an excellent spot for authentic Mediterranean cuisine. I have been to Israel several times and this place is the real deal! I've gone 2 times now and both times the food has been excellent. I highly recommend the hummus falafel as an appetizer: the falafel are fried to perfection, super crunchy and flavorful, but not the least bit greasy. And the hummus is smooth and delicious. The second time I came I got the lamb burger which had a tangy mayo sauce and came with a slice of feta cheese on top. It was cooked to perfection (I got medium) and packed with flavor. The service here is great as well, the food came out in around 15 minutes. This place has a great location in Brooklyn and is certainly a regular for me for brunch."

We ordered drinks and didn't get them until after we finished our entire meals after asking about them twice. I ordered the stuffed cabbage which came out luke warm and then when I tried my mashed potatoes they were actually cold. I had to get my food reheated. And finally, the semi-outdoor seating area was so packed that we could barely fit at our table and kept bumping into the people on all sides around us. This place clearly took on more business than they could handle. Three strikes they're out."

Kartik S.,/user_details?userid=zaLI-zjNZGnv6PbhfAbnwg,"New York, NY",2/9/2022,1,So loud you can't hear yourself or your friends. The owner will lie to your face about the volume and ignore noise complaints even when enforced by 311. He is a miserable fucking asshole. Don't go here.

We also got the chicken schnitzel which was huge and so tasty.  They didn't have malabi when we went but I can't wait to go back to try that.

Food was worth it though! The cauliflower and hummus with mushroom and onion was a great way to start off the meal. The 12 chairs salad was good, but had too much dressing. Chicken schnitzel came in a really large portion- the honey mustard dressing was my favorite part. We also ordered a side of the 12 chair home fries and egg whites. Overall, food was amazing, and would definitely come back!"

One thing to note is that both my friend and I had no interest service when we dined here and when we logged on to the restaurants WiFi we still were not able to log on our phones to look up pictures on Yelp to figure out what to eat. We both ordered the chicken schnitzel a side of hummus for apps, and We ordered margaritas. The drinks were okay, just very acidic more than I would like. The chicken was delicious though very flavorful and cooked perfectly. The hummus we ordered never arrived though, but I think because the schnitzel was really good and filled us up we didn't care too much about the appetizer. Overall good is good drinks are okay and service is okay."

John C.,/user_details?userid=BPc8v3bdJmcM0W8r0cpt8g,"Bronx, NY",7/17/2022,1,"I pass this restaurant on my way to work and was impressed that they were bustling at 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning.  I love breakfast so I decided to treat myself. On the morning in question,  I arrived a little after 8 and was seated. The first strike against them is the tables are too low and being 6'1"", I was uncomfortable. Then the server had an attitude as if I should be lucky to be in his presence, what? He handed me a menu and went to fetch my coffee. He warmed up a bit as he sat down opposite me, and crossed his legs to take my order. I felt that was a little forward and unusual but I let it go. I commented to him on how the place always seemed so busy with a line of customers waiting which he confirmed, ""We're always slammed."" At this time there were maybe 4 tables occupied? I ordered the Shakshuka. He suggested, and admittedly, his accent was strong so I didn't understand everything he said as the loud Israeli pop music played. Anyhow, as I understood it, adding the Israeli breakfast was a good value and authentic, so I went along. Stupid me, I realized as the food was served, that I basically ordered 2 breakfasts and spent more than twice as much money as I had planned. I am usually savvy but it was early and I wanted to enjoy myself, not have my guard up. Lastly, the food wasn't exceptional, not terrible but nothing stood out. When I asked for the check and requested a to-go bag for the many dips that I couldn't possibly have eaten, I was handed a bag and 5 little plastic to-go condiment cups with ill-fitting lids that I had to fill, and the server disappeared.  I know of some people who don't tip if they've experienced bad service at a restaurant, but I'm not one of them. I always tip 20% or more if the service is good, that's just how I am. I know we're all struggling to exist in this insane city that, like the rest of the country, has gotten over the top expensive. The server's behavior was underhanded, and deceptive so he can get more money, very disappointing. On a somewhat positive note, I liked the menu choices for dinner, perhaps I'll give this restaurant another chance? Currently, I have no plans on returning."

My biggest criticism: we questioned the policy of serving iced decaf coffee in a smaller glass than iced regular. Answer: ""We do refills."" I've been to enough restaurants to know that means refills are complimentary. The bill: 7 iced coffees. We were told, ""We do refills but we charge for them."" Huh?"

Sabir M.,/user_details?userid=-H0tGG-IGogKdiKC0OaEuQ,"Bensonhurst, NY",2/26/2021,1,Very interesting place ordered once through Uber eats and it took almost 3 hours to get the food but surprisingly it still tasted great so attempted to reach out this time in order takeout hopefully I can get it a lot quicker and to my surprise they wouldn't take an order because they claim to be too busy so I waited the hour they requested and I place the order online. As they advised but to my surprise they canceled my order which was very weird so I called the restaurant and they said they're not taking any orders at this time which really was extremely interesting to me not sure how I feel but recommending it
Jim B.,/user_details?userid=5_1AYuDFKGUyoJ7Srbb0eg,"Chicago, IL",9/19/2021,5,Excellent food and great decor. The hummus was some of the best I've had. The chicken skewers and lamb was great. Worth a stop for sure.

A K.,/user_details?userid=Qct_c2xq5-vM9X__2BnBvg,"Brooklyn, NY",6/12/2021,1,"This place is in no way safe for anyone with celiac. There's no designated fryer, widespread cross-contamination in the kitchen, and servers with no knowledge or empathy for folks with allergies/celiacs. I used Nima to test an order of grilled chicken with raw tomato salad on top (which I was assured was safe). Nima said ""gluten found."" I then ordered a Nicoise salad with no dressing. Again, ""gluten found."" The wait staff/manager didn't apologize and told me that I should stop ordering and this wasn't a restaurant for someone with CD. Frankly, it felt really crappy and the food that I did eat (babaganoush and labneh, which I also had a reaction to) wasn't worth it. Under-salted and nothing special. Don't waste your time or your money here."

Shane R.,/user_details?userid=fFvH96SqpsQJKoWl1asRBw,"FOREST HILLS, NY",7/18/2021,5,This place was so good! I made a reservation for about 10 people that changed twice and they were super accommodating. The food was excellent! The most authentic Israeli cuisine I've ever had in NY. Was there on a Saturday night so the atmosphere was a lot of fun with great music and it was a good time! Would highly recommend for a birthday or other celebratory dinner.

We went at 2pm on a Saturday they have music so loud you can not hear anything, we asked to turn it down but the server just told us this was 'the vibe' and stormed off. Do not sit anywhere near the building - it's just painful. While the food is still good the service is just painful."

That's no the way you treat customers .                           To the manager, if you don't want to see anyone seating  outside  at 10:00 pm then you should tell  the staff to inform people before they seat down .

It's very small inside (is 12 chairs actually how many they have?), but since the weather was nice we sat outside. The portions are large-ish (sharable) and things came out quickly. I wouldn't recommend this for parties larger than 4 or 5. I had one complaint. They allowed a dog off-leash to go around bothering other tables and create possible opportunities for staff or patrons bringing out food to trip over it. I think there is a fine line in being accommodating and allowing chaos.  Food was great though and we took home leftovers."

My husband and I came in on a Sunday for a late brunch. We had been wanting to check this place out for a while. We were seated and the waiter took our order. I asked him questions regarding my selection and he literally read off the menu the description. Okay, fine. He brings us our drinks and basically throws them on the table. Okay, maybe that was an accident. He brings coffee without milk - we asked four separate waiters - not one remembered to bring it until we asked the manager. Our brunch came out and they forget to bring the home fries. They brought the home fries when we were done. Then I ask for salt and pepper - the waiter proceeds to throw the salt and pepper on the table to the point the manager came over apologizing ""this is not how we treat our customers"" They send over a new waitress - who brings over 2 separate teas (I ordered one) she was apologetic about the situation and after we finished eating - she said desert is on her. She literally never came back and we paid the bill and left. Both teas were also on the bill, but at that point we were done talking to them and just paid for it. What a horrible experience - we were so looking forward to trying 12 chairs! They need to restructure their entire staff and start over. This is completely unacceptable."

Elaine B.,/user_details?userid=Cn09q1FRnXZoUzUetPh8eg,"Manhattan, NY",2/20/2021,5,I've been to the Manhattan location a number of times but this time during Covid we ordered a special box for Shabbat from the Wythe St restaurant Marvelous. The box includes challah pita mezzes a choice of a main dish plus their favorite schnitzel rice and a lovely dessert. The portions are ample for four or more and delicious. The hummus is creamy eggplant salad divinely smoky tabouli and matbucha all yummy. And everyone munched on pickles and olives The large crispy schnitzels were soft enough to cut with a fork. We had the cooked chicken which just fell off the bone. The meal ended with knafeh with an orange blossom sauce. Each dish was in a container that went right into the oven for heating. This box is well worth it.
Jessica L.,/user_details?userid=HZQPkKulyeKLCehD_uN0Nw,"Selden, NY",1/3/2021,5,Quick and free local delivery.  Super tasty vegetable soup with couscous.  It was like a home cooked and was so comforting after a cold rainy day out.

Adria C.,/user_details?userid=uXVc33UGz604b-OaIuLwbw,"Baltimore, MD",5/27/2017,5,"Biked over for brunch and was not disappointed. We were hungry so ordered quite a few plates. Shakshuka, lamb kebabs, and french toast (with great fruit spread...no red grapes or tasteless melon chunks). The entrees came with crusty bread to soak up every last bit of the savory tomato sauce and probably the best Israeli salad I've ever had. Instant fan of 12 Chairs."
Yana g.,/user_details?userid=RrdPXc7ATIfL2tpuiL5kmg,"Brooklyn, NY",2/13/2021,1,Such a shame. We go there on the regular and by far the worst experience.  Whoever is the hostess needs a lesson on manners and customer service. Beyond rude beyond disrespectful. We were ok with sitting outside however 20 min into sitting not one person came up to us. Hostess was well aware however was too busy entertaining a group of people waiting for the rest of their party. Completely disrespectful completely unacceptable. Would never go there to spend money if they can't even handle to have customer service.

I enjoyed the falafel and hummus however my fish was extremely underwhelming. I ordered the Moroccan Fish, excited for the vibrant Moroccan spices and it tasted like they just thawed a frozen piece of tilapia and added some cherry tomatoes. There was no spice or flavor other than the tomatoes."
Craig R.,/user_details?userid=UMbt1mu0BhwX0nKIlE41ag,"Brooklyn, NY",11/14/2019,4,We really like this place. Go there often with our kids. Breakfast all day is a plus. The Moroccan fish is excellent and a go to. Excellent humus and falafel as well. For breakfast the different egg dishes are all good. Challah French toast is great as well. Overall this is a very solid neighborhood place.
Marzena D.,/user_details?userid=_tT5l4TUX24Dis7juSg8CQ,"New York, NY",7/9/2019,4,"Myself and my friend fancied a little snack on a sunny afternoon and we stumbled across this lovely place. We were greeted by a sweet waitress who walked us to our table. Restaurant wasn't busy as it was about 5pm. We ordered some hummus which comes with yummy pita bread as well as some olives and gherkins- sweet touch! and a portion of potato/onions pierogi. The food was really good, being a pierogi expert I definitely approve, if they put them on a frying pan with a bit of butter they would have tested even better however even just boiled and served with a sour cream they were very yum. Service was smooth and with no faults. Atmosphere relaxed and friendly. I would definitely return."

Erica S.,/user_details?userid=tC4yu9ngVanw5pRqb6ZY1g,"Brooklyn, NY",9/9/2017,5,Love 12 Chairs! I come often and always have a good meal. Recently they have added liquor to the menu and things are just getting better. I always order in when I have big groups over. Very authentic feel and always a full tummy when you leave.
Karl W.,/user_details?userid=X09yTL1vCzFh__bIZdrZRw,"Arlington, VA",2/24/2019,4,"Went here for Saturday brunch. My big issue was the volume of the music, it was blaring. The menu is extensive and I'd love to go back and try more. I ordered the shashuka with a side of pita and it was fantastic. I love that it came with Shepard salad. We had a great table and I liked the ambiance of the place. My only issue as mentioned earlier was the volume of the music. I had trouble hearing my friends and felt my throat getting sore from yelling to talk. You're not going to please everyone but turning it down 25% would put it in a more normal range, I shouldn't feel like I'm at a nightclub at 12 in the afternoon."
Sabrina A.,/user_details?userid=SmJ3ms2AuSHJHhIbUSXT8Q,"Philadelphia, PA",7/14/2019,5,"This place has such a good atmosphere, and great food. The service is really nice and attentive. But it gets hot inside! Dress accordingly."

Amanda C.,/user_details?userid=7QrIFBKUFOQpnHpemxsJpA,"New York, NY",3/4/2020,1,"The worst service and judging by the reviews, not surprised now. Sat at the bar and the bartender acted like everything was a nuisance to her. Didn't even give us water after 15 mins waiting for coffee. When we asked we literally saw her grab two dirty glasses from a container of dirty dishes. There was food floating in both of our glasses. How do you not think we can see you do that in plain sight.  Watching her do her job was painful. Not sure if it was a bad day or what. But even her own coworkers seemed to have annoyed her. The manager even yelled behind us to tell her to suck it up. Then when it was time to go, I asked if I can wrap it up. The guy who wrapped up my food, didn't even out the correct lid on it and let it just hang off in the to go bag. None of the staff seemed kind in any way. Too bad, because the food was pretty good. But definitely not coming back, wasn't that worth it."

Music was extra loud and impossible to have a conversation. They rushed my pregnat friend out of the bathroom for no reason (there was no one waiting) and they treated her with a very condescending tone when she asked a few questions about the menu. It used to be a lot better before, not sure if they changed management but never going back again.  Also food is average, nothing special. TERRIBLE experience."

I've also been there for dinner on a Sunday night, it was just the right amount of crowded, where it felt like the strangers around, were friends. I can't remember what I got, but I felt happily full afterwards! Highly recommend!"

Gus L.,/user_details?userid=0WP56dc8hHWQpUVy7ErtHQ,"Manhattan, NY",5/18/2019,5,My fab place for the chicken schnitzel. Get it with home fries and salad. Also great vibe. Everyone super friendly.
Molly N.,/user_details?userid=N8mPh0d1cDtSYELxB24VJg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11/2/2019,3,"The menu is great as it has everything most people including me love. But my couscous with vegan broth was too dry and didn't have much flavor. My husband's pancake was better but nothing special. They were quite busy at around 10:30am on Saturday and so I guess that was why the service was subpar, unfortunately."
Margo K.,/user_details?userid=VWwRhjqvTiVhT3KfGMUVYQ,"New York, NY",12/13/2017,5,"Love the ambiance. Excellent Service. Delicious food. This is such a lovely place. The servers are warm and welcoming; they made us feel right at home. And to eat... I left there completely stuffed. We had the Cauliflower, Hummus falafel, and the Israeli Salad (mine was with smoked salmon, my friend had hers with chicken) and everything was divine. Although I had no room for dessert (I almost licked my plate), I ordered a cappuccino and that too was everything I could ask for. We'll definitely return."
Karen B.,/user_details?userid=38J0Q4Xer_qks7eZRNJ0QQ,"Sonoma, CA",6/22/2019,4,My oatmeal was made just right; not too soupy like some restaurants.  Everyone enjoyed their omelette and the coffee was good.  They need work on improving service. The restaurant was less than half full and the waiter gave his co-workers more attention than us.
Natalia G.,/user_details?userid=Ca-wjc2NJFVfjcEMyze8FA,"Ogden, UT",3/17/2019,5,Amazing cocktails and loved the falafel hummus as well as the shnietzel salad - great vibes and just a delish place

Second, they attempted to charge us for two beverages we didn't order. Third, we asked for our food to go because they sat us in a little secluded section next to the kitchen and we couldn't enjoy our food because the sound of clanking cutlery was literally 3 inches from our ears (do not sit here if you go). And the worst part... When we got home we saw that they only packed HALF of the food, with two dishes missing. Food is decent, but as you can tell the service is extremely disappointing."
Megan D.,/user_details?userid=sGHQw6jTzENK1Uf5LFQEoQ,"New York, NY",6/5/2017,4,"Love the food here. The shashuka and the hummus with falafel was to die for. The environment was super cute and the coffee here was soooo good. Although, I am not so sure about the chicken liver hot dish and the home fries. I am very particular about my fries so, I like them cooked differently. Although for chicken liver, even though im all up for it, I think the way it marinates could sit a little longer so the chicken liver taste is not as pungent. Although it was a very interesting dish. LOVE THE PITA BREAD TOO, THOSE WERE AMAZING"
Avital l.,/user_details?userid=17erYQicYU5Ztqch8fjVHw,"Skokie, IL",8/21/2017,5,Great food friendly service nice drink menu.  I would recommend this place for its elevated medeterinan cuisine and by the way the have 2 locations.  Give it a try.
Ali M.,/user_details?userid=R2FhUM7mZfO16kxpIK7Vmg,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",7/3/2019,5,Great babaganouj and I really enjoyed the sabich sandwhich. Cool vibe in the store and prices are very reasonable.
sharon p.,/user_details?userid=PTW2wI9qcXG9UNR1eFLI9A,"Berkeley, CA",2/8/2020,1,"Probably the worst service I've had. Not only did our food take forever, but no one-- from the hostess to the manager, had any courtesy around it. The manager was obnoxious about being asked about the lateness of our food and essentially made us feel like it was an imposition of hat we were asking where our food was. The hostess acted affronted that someone would bring to her (oh my gosh!) a complaint about how long the food was taking.  In the competitive Brooklyn restaurant scene, you should care aboUt service. Here, they clearly  do not. Go to 1 of the other hundreds of great restaurants in bk."

E E.,/user_details?userid=LrX_JNzupE4SfCvNooVmIg,"Queens, Queens, NY",9/29/2020,1,I'm sorry to say but I didn't have a comfortable meal there cause the manager who is new cause I have been there previously and know there was a different guy now it's a woman who yells inappropriately to the staff and demeans them.   How am I suppose to enjoy my meal when this continues to happen (yes it hasn't only been once).  She doesn't treat her staff appropriately so if you want insults and an uncomfortable environment this is the place for you. It's sad cause some of the waiters and staff is very nice.  Don't know if I would go back cause of her.
Gabriela N.,/user_details?userid=mcQtmEtj0RVQZNtdmEuCWQ,"Orlando, FL",10/25/2020,5,"I was visiting friends in Brooklyn and we couldn't find a place to have Brunch and this place was our only option. At first we were really disappointed at the service since the chef got my friend's order wrong twice and we weren't being checked up on often by the waitress. The reason why I am giving 5 stars is because the Owners & Managers do seem to really care about their business and wanted to keep us happy. After we discussed our concerns with the service that day with the manager and owner... they asked us ""What can we do to make it better?"" We did not wanted anything else because we don't expect anything from anyone. We just wanted to express the concern and move forward. However, they turned it around by giving us two rounds of whiskey shots complimentary and giving us a delicious dessert which was the chocolate mousse. Overall this place is amazing and rich with culture!  We loved the food and I will be coming back! Because this place showed that they really do care for their Guests."
Jennifer W.,/user_details?userid=eND-roaTB2JYxgoBs55iBw,"Brooklyn, NY",6/6/2019,5,"I was reluctant to try 12 Chairs because it's housed in the location where one of my favorite neighborhood spots used to be, but I actually enjoyed it. I sat in the outdoor seating. The waiter was attentive and accommodating. He let me order off of the kiosk menu (their to-go menu). As of late, I've become a falafel sandwich connoisseur. And they have one of the best falafel sandwiches I've ever had, they drizzle this extra sauce on it which is super bomb. I also had an Arnold Palmer and to my suprise, they used fresh squeezed lemonade. Over pleasant experience."
Michelle M.,/user_details?userid=dvG2GSZvgfSHHqqjq2ghsw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/20/2020,1,Terrible experience from start to finish.  We waited 25 min to even be greeted and put on a waiting list.  The old women with the over all's was extremely rude and unhelpful.  They sat other people first that arrived after us.  Once sat it took another 20 minutes to order drinks or to get attention from anyone who worked here.  We had to physically get up and ask if we could order drinks since it was 90 degrees out.  No water was given to us.  The food took 35 mins and the order was incorrect and incomplete.  The restaurant seemed extremely under staffed.  I won't be back.

After waiting a while we checked in with the waitstaff to see how many parties were ahead of us and were told we would be seated next. After waiting an additional 30 minutes not one but TWO other parties of our size were seated ahead of us. Clearly they don't have an organized system for seating people and their excuse was that they 'got confused'. Food was nothing special, falafel and hummus were decent the rest of what we ordered was quite bland. Drinks weren't great either. To top things off the waiter made a very snarky comment to us at the end of our meal...with so many restaurants in Williamsburg save yourself the hassle and frustration and go literally anywhere else"
Sarah R.,/user_details?userid=c_TaQfHVPkY4iFX0nod3iA,"Ellington, CT",7/2/2019,5,One of my favorite spots in Brooklyn - all the food reminds me of home. Make sure to order the cauliflower! And end the night with the muhalabiyeh!
Rachel J.,/user_details?userid=L2nEUYLXJIrQoek-eNV5tA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/8/2019,4,This is a great restaurant with a good ambiance.

Johnny S.,/user_details?userid=oRmOvv5kU6e5ZnJVo0QDsQ,"Westbury, NY",5/29/2017,5,"The food here was so delicious. Mind you I'm only going by what I ordered, which were the Hummus with Falafel plate and an order of Arayes. Both were yummy and huge portions. The waitress did give me a notice that plates were big but I went through with the two orders and I could've saved money by sticking with only the hummus and Falafel plate since it was huge. And! They give two pitas with it which means you get 2 Falafel sandwiches stuffed with hummus for $11! But I don't regret having the Arayes either as they were so delicious. They are basically crispy lamb pits sandwiches. So good. And the white sauce and peppers accent the flavors of the lamb and pita really well. I loved this place and will definitely be back!"

Service was excellent and my Gin Rocks was a nice pour! Overall, 12 Chairs is a friendly high quality destination. The only reason I'm not giving a fifth star is because the menu is somewhat limited. I would have loved to see a kabab or some other skewer available to distinguish it as Israeli a bit more if that makes sense."

Pete S.,/user_details?userid=w_CaoUm-8M5yxdIrPHs2RQ,"Providence, RI",11/12/2019,3,Food was good. Service was bad. The waitress tacked on $10 worth of add-ons without first letting us know. I was just surprised and wished to have known earlier. That's all. Food is pretty good Middle Eastern flavors.
Ruthie S.,/user_details?userid=NbCryIGMev9u6JT9yD2r5w,"Studio City, CA",11/10/2019,1,Used to be a nice place with kind service- NO MORE. 3 weeks ago we ordered a take out for 95 dollars- we received a pack with someone else's order (far cheaper). We asked for our money back 6 times! Each time we've been told a manger will get back to us and a refund will be sent. Obviously he never did and no refund was placed- otherwise I wouldn't write this

Mandara Z.,/user_details?userid=C4BFouuTj82P3SImiu9GoQ,"Los Angeles, CA",10/6/2017,4,"Lovely Middle Eastern place with great food and good-looking people.  Came here for brunch on one Saturday, aaamazing shakshouka, solid hummus and really refreshing mint tea. No complaints but only this place makes feel I should be eating Middle Eastern food more."
Jamie T.,/user_details?userid=b5iXa3sAASLWBszMTsPM4w,"Manhattan, NY",9/7/2019,3,"Food is decent, but the atmosphere is less than desirable unless you like incredibly loud music blaring all through your meal. Also, they shouldn't place put tables in areas where the staff can't walk by without constantly running into the chairs. I'm a tiny person so my chair definitely isn't pushed out in an abnormal way. If you are a normal sized person be prepared to have staff running into you during your entire meal."

Faye G.,/user_details?userid=b-Xi1-FLGekXWmdc7CRe0g,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",9/7/2017,5,Great food and absolutely lovely atmosphere. We went during brunch time on a weekend and the wait wasn't so bad before 2. Highly recommend.
Ashley D.,/user_details?userid=4JhHu4w_WH0nocDNB6O_kw,"Brooklyn, NY",5/8/2018,5,I started off my lunch with the fresh hummus and fresh baked pita they both were great. You get two pita and the hummus is enough to last you awhile. For my main I decided I would have the chicken pocket stuffed with spinach and cheese just delicious. The wait staff is courteous and helpful. Not overbearing and they giving you your space while making sure you have everything you need. Definitely recommend this place especially on a warm breezy spring day.
Olivia W.,/user_details?userid=Qv0cLNM7R41sDuAZsnp6_Q,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",10/29/2017,2,Our food didn't come for 40 mins while all the tables around us had been served.

Elle S.,/user_details?userid=3MIg0ju4yEj9YNEJtaOpbA,"Long Island City, New York, NY",8/11/2019,3,"Be prepared to wait on a weekend brunch (wait to get table and wait to get food).  That being said they'll text you to come back when your table is ready.  The wait for coffee and food was about 50 minutes.  The music was blaring in this hipster haven.  The pancakes were great, complimentary tomato/cucumber salad refreshing.  The cauliflower was divine, probably one of the best takes on cauliflower I have had.  That being said, everything was super slow as the place is just too crowded and loud in the weekend.  Bringing your parents or small kids would not work in this ""Bklyn too cool"" spot bc of the waits."
Rose D.,/user_details?userid=Pzmdka3K06FJtP-d3te9zA,"Edmonds, WA",9/14/2016,4,"Fresh pita and hummus has my heart, and this place did both amazingly!

P S.,/user_details?userid=IgsvUd3SYiLZ6SiYZsleqg,"Brooklyn, NY",7/19/2017,3,"Not my style I guess... people seem to love it but I don't know, service was too casual and relaxed for me...food looks better than it taste, and the bacon is so thin you can see straight through it...decor is nice. I guess go, maybe, or just go next door to Sunday's in Brooklyn and have patience as you wait an hour for a table..."
Aurelie T.,/user_details?userid=buLW8qmPyUaOWSuDaQ9mBQ,"Venice, CA",4/26/2015,4,"We liked the decoration, the vibe, the situation in South Williamsburg. We ate well and the service is good.

We might make it a regular spot :-)."
Kara M.,/user_details?userid=JAhKqCb8TgkCbwa9rT2__Q,"Manhattan, NY",3/4/2018,4,Came here after reading through reviews.  The ambience is quite relaxing and in line with sunday vibes.  The food is consisent and decently priced for the area.  I reccomend the schniztel salad for a satisfying yet light brunch.

Mehmet K.,/user_details?userid=J9bicveWDCN5lDOzMV6eMQ,"Los Angeles, CA",3/9/2017,4,This place has delicious food and very friendly staff. The design of the place is so good and very bright. The tables right next to the windows are perfect for nice weathers. We almost tried everything in the menu in our multiple visits and loved all of them. I lived couple blocks from this place and placed an order couple times and the delivery was pretty fast too. Some items are little pricey but I guess that what you get being in Williamsburg. Highly recommend visiting this place.

They were out of Blue Moon, but we came in at 10 PM to be fair. Hummus with mushrooms and onions is really good! It would be nice if they offered more pita comp'd.  But $11 is a lot for a mediocre portion size. We also got grape leaves - came with only 4 which were very small, not that good and also way over priced. My boyfriend got a chicken pocket dish which was fine too but nothing exceptional. The vibe is really nice but there are so many other places in the area where you get get a better bang for your buck."

Steve S.,/user_details?userid=A3wsZsMeBVvZprWQfVldCQ,"Newburyport, MA",6/4/2019,3,Went for breakfast on a Sunday about 10 AM.  Food was good but service was glacial.  The staff sat behind us and ate breakfast in shifts.  I would think they could eat before or after the breakfast rush but had to practically beg for coffee and a refill was half a cup.  Coffee is the first thing that should be provided for diners  - felt like I was down south vs. go go NYC.  Great ambiance but overshadowed by the poor service.

Every single thing I've tried on the menu from the lamb burger to the shakshuka is absolutely delicious. The decor and ambiance are awesome. Reminds me of cafés/restaurants in Montreal. If you're in Williamsburg you should definitely give this place a try. Guaranteed you'll love it.
Sab J.,/user_details?userid=9tmcTz28KiWGv3lnoZEPlQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/7/2019,4,"I've been walking by this places for ages and finally decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. There's so many mouth watering items on the menu but what sold me was the quality service. The food was great and had my friend craving it the day after we ate there. Would have loved to try their cocktails but we went early in order to avoid the crowd,this place can get crazy busy! Been starting to recommend this place to all my friends. This is a MUST try restaurant !!! Lamb kebabs cooked perfectly and they have a killer Israeli salad."

I was having a seriously crappy day when I found myself in that dreaded restaurant dead-zone (3-5pm when every restaurant in the galaxy is in between shifts). Enter 12 Chairs with their sexy ""you've never tasted hummus before unless you've tasted ours"" homemade onion mushroom hummus, warm handmade pita, roasted cauliflower, and Moroccan fish (don't dare judge me all you legit vegans out there!) WHAT A MEAL!!! You were right, This meal definitely turned my bad day around!

V Z.,/user_details?userid=h2BjIAiYoaoe7eP3BHIlQw,"New York, NY",12/20/2018,2,"Really great hummus and decent schnitzel. Unfortunately, service leaves much to be desired. Watched waitress write down my order then she apparently forgot to give it to the kitchen. Took them 25 minutes to make a salad after they forgot the order and had to be reminded, waitress was not apologetic at all and got offended when I asked for the meal to go since it had taken too long and everyone in my party was already almost done eating. Generally unimpressed by the experience."
Adrian T.,/user_details?userid=_6KTvDt5kF40JPMJNTb2yg,"New York, NY",6/23/2016,1,"One star for service. Was seated outdoors and then :30 seconds later our table was revoked.

Liz Z.,/user_details?userid=MdZygqk1p8YnLkgheFya9w,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",4/19/2019,3,Sat at 1:24. At 2:15 we still hadn't eaten. I paid and asked for it to go. Took a good 15 mins for a server to even come over after I asked if I could order. It sucks bc the food is great. The music is incredibly loud if that's bothersome to you.

The shakshouka was on point. Everything else we had (bavaria, a sandwitch with with potatoes, an egg dish, the greek salad and one other thing, but I forget what) was ok -- I wouldn't order any of them again, but I wouldn't send them back to the kitchen. That said, it's worth a visit for the hummus and pita and shakshouka. Delicious. The ambiance is also very nice."

Cait M.,/user_details?userid=Acvuw2dCNanBVv2xIo1tQQ,"Brooklyn, NY",1/19/2018,4,This is a good go to spot in the neighborhood.

All were flavorful and delicious for different reasons. The Greek salad had croutons made out of pita bread which was a winner! Crunchy and seasoned. The meat in the hummus consisted of ground beef, onions, pine nuts, onions and mushrooms and was served right in the middle of a bowl of hummus. We also ordered sweet potatoes for the table which came out perfectly fried. Would definitely go back!"
Jessica D.,/user_details?userid=B9xlVKo7TcS1kdtV225IRQ,"Brooklyn, NY",7/15/2015,5,The borscht is a meal unto itself and so nourishing.  I barely have room for the other stuff in our order.  The pierogies are buttery tender morsels -  a big improvement on the big rubbery ones that you typically encounter and they come with lovely sautéed onions and mushrooms.  It's worth the high price tag.   I've learned to appreciate chicken livers because of this place.  And the lamb burger is worth while too.  But really all I need is the borscht.  It's so comforting and full of shredded cabbage.  Really hits the spot.
Charlene A.,/user_details?userid=hiD7SpxBs482xfro7_al-g,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",9/30/2018,1,Honestly extremely dissatisfied with the service at this restaurant. We waited approximately 40 minutes before leaving because we still had not received our food. Within those 40 minutes not once did our waitress approach our table. Service was extremely distasteful and we will never be entering this establishment again. Besides the ambiance this place has nothing to offer.

Instead of politely saying she'd prefer not to seat us (which would have been totally fine-- places to eat in the neighborhood are not hard to find), the hostess was incredibly rude and aggressive, despite the fact that we specifically mentioned we'd find somewhere else if it was an inconvenience. I was so off-put by the unnecessarily biting tone and lack of basic human courtesy that I will never be coming back to this place again and am confident my friends won't either."
Kate S.,/user_details?userid=hGcofrWymKgvjP9sNw4xnA,"Port Washington, NY",8/25/2018,1,this place gave me all the wrong food. I told them I was celiac and cannot eat gluten yet they gave me pita in a salad when they told me it was an omelette because I had ordered an omelete and I ate it. I had a huge reaction. the waitress didnt even apologize. very overpriced for not even the right food and was not an organized business whatsover. I do not recommend.

Great schnitzel, generous breakfasts, good hummus and tahini sauce and short waiting time. Great indoor and outdoor sitting, and fast delivery. Definitely recommend both Williamsburg and the city location"
Mike L.,/user_details?userid=JwNMSkxIyC5mfWqFOXiOrA,"Brooklyn, NY",4/19/2015,5,Super place. Love their dishes with great taste. Nice staff as well. We came with a stroller and they were super nice. Good quality and all dishes are really home made. You must try.
Polar B.,/user_details?userid=NpAzPKdkQy-ptBnJG1lZkw,"Brooklyn, NY",8/2/2019,3,"i love the food. lots of options and generally affordable. the service sucks. everytime i come here, they screw up the order or the time it takes to get the food. maybe they need more service staff"
Mathias H.,/user_details?userid=EeQGwI7oBgCEyzVw06Tc8g,"Brooklyn, NY",6/30/2015,4,"One of the few places in the neighborhood that actually has a breakfast menu and opens at 8am!  Excellent Israeli style food (non-kosher) with excellent quality and friendly service. Atmosphere is very nice, with all the walls opening up to the street, even behind the bar. Plating is exceptional, most meals are garnished with yummy edibles like fruit and veggies."
Nicole G.,/user_details?userid=DLtVaq-8BuS3Uzun28TR8w,"Bayside, NY",5/10/2016,4,"Came here last night with my friend and we loved it! The restaurant is really cute and quaint and the waitresses were so friendly to us.  We ordered the labneh and the hummus with pita and it was amaaaazinggggg. I got the shakshuka and it was DELICIOUS! It was just enough spice for a kick but wasnt overly spicy. She got the lamb burger and liked it overall. Would definitely come again!. Only down side is it is a bit on the pricey side. For the shakshuka, it was 11 dollars (came with 2 eggs) and to add the feta was $3.00.  Would come again and recommend! Will be back !"

M And M C.,/user_details?userid=QqugiXMmfu8DL4PgIr02iQ,"Brooklyn, NY",12/18/2016,3,We eat here all the time. Call us regulars. Today we walk in. No wait and 2 tables of 4 open. But the young hosrefuses to seat us.  Make us wait instead for a table of 2 open. A bit gauche. Not cool.
Anna B.,/user_details?userid=S_8ztnWls5kUkILAmazPDQ,"New York, NY",6/5/2017,5,"This place is delicious. I've been here about 4 times. Went for lunch today and had the hummus with falafel and a giant salad with pear and hazelnuts. Food was great, service was fine.  Only complaint is that it's somewhat pricey."
Allison Z.,/user_details?userid=bd-qbpubLxI8vJcc5WgVkA,"New York, NY",11/20/2016,4,"My friends and I were so happy to stumble across this place while hangry in Williamsburg. We had the guacamole to start and it was amazing. The pita couldn't have been toasted more perfectly and it was an interesting touch to have bits of egg in there. We also had a roasted cauliflower dish that was delicious. We finished with the eggplant starter. It was good, but not as good as the other two things. The guy behind the bar who was serving us was really friendly and helpful. I'm taking a star off because we sat at the bar to eat, which was totally fine but the barstools were super wobbly. In addition, they were made of wood and not sanded down, and I got a ton of splinters in my you know what. It also ruined my leggings, as I had tons of pieces of wood stuck in the fabric. Would recommend to the managers to think about getting new stools."
Ryan G.,/user_details?userid=ApIVfzNkCWkad_clvsUqXg,"Staten Island, NY",2/11/2017,5,Excellent food.  Great find. I felt like I was in a cafe in Tel Aviv. Very fresh. I highly recommend the lamb burger. The sweet potato fries were sublime.
Mich L.,/user_details?userid=w2rQz5Di44V-XFR8PMM9VA,"Brooklyn, NY",6/2/2016,5,"Came here for brunch! Love this place. Just the perfect combo of light and heavy food.

Robyn T.,/user_details?userid=M7Av0su4nHkKunhyodSw_g,"Los Angeles, CA",3/8/2017,2,"12 Chairs is around the corner and one of our favorite restaurants in Williamsburg. My husband and I are always greeted by the same lovely busser and the staff are so great. This evening though I am very upset. My card was declined at the end of our meal, which I knew must be a fault. The waitress was incredibly rude about it - loudly proclaimed that my card had been declined- with a number of busy tables around us to hear it. Then went to chat about it to her fellow waitrons who all turned to look at us - in our clear view! This was of course terribly embarrassing for me. I've now come home to find my card has been charged three times. An error which I'm sure will be fixed, and I don't fault the restaurant for this. However the way it was handled by the waitress was just not ok. Things like this happen but a little discretion - and benefit of the doubt for regular customers - I think would be a far better way to handle such a situation."

As soon as I walked in, the woman at the door began questioning me. After I told her that we wanted drinks at the bar, she proceeded to tell me that there was no room at the bar (there was 3 Available seats) and that we cant just drink at a table. She then said ""we are not starbucks"". I suggest everyone to think twice before coming to visit this place ESPECIALLY when the FIRST THING you have to deal with is a miserable hostess and terrible customer service. Never again:"

Alex G.,/user_details?userid=Vlcg5o2uBnEmk1DraD2OTg,"Brooklyn, NY",4/3/2015,5,This place opened right down the block from me and I'm so glad I tried it.  I came for lunch I had the Israeli salad and the hummus with whole wheat pita and both were delicious. I brought my mom and she had the matzoh ball soup and the Israeli salad and she enjoyed both as well.  The prices are very reasonable and they were offering 10% off since they recently opened.  Will definitely be going back!
N C.,/user_details?userid=RFo_Z14r6Aa4yWj8wl4Ymw,"Brooklyn, NY",5/2/2015,1,I was here about two weeks ago   On a Saturday morning with my two young girls. They did not allowed us to seat by the window.  Made look like they are not too kid friendly here.  Very disappointed.

Michelle L.,/user_details?userid=IBMI3FEp1qW_PbPlIsB2cA,"Brooklyn, NY",1/31/2023,3,"I enjoyed the ambiance and art deco vibes. I was a little disappointed in the food. We ordered a number of the veggie sides and they were overly greasy and the brussel sprouts felt over cooked and burned. The fava bean appetizer can be skipped completely. It's confusing and pricey. I asked for a vegetarian pasta as there were no options on the menu and they offered me spaghetti with tomato sauce. No vegetables could be added I was told. The mushroom pizza was pretty good I will say. Probably not coming back though, not vegan friendly."

To be honest, we actually ended up ordering another Amlfitana we thought it was that good. The Mondeghili (not pictured) was a tad dry but still very good, we especially enjoyed the sauce it came with. The Zucchine was under cooked and pieces varied in size substantially, the Cavoletti di Bruxelles was nothing special, and would not recommend the Ravioli Pere e Gorgonzola. Overall a nice vibe and would go back again for drinks and appetizers but less likely to eat a full dinner there."

Hello I don't want to sit shoulder to shoulder with strangers during a pandemic. The pizza would've been good but the crust had zero flavor. Salt is your friend if you eat here. After years of learning to cook at home since The Shutdown, there's nothing on this menu you can't make for much cheaper. It would probably taste better. Ridiculous Manhattan prices for bland food in Brooklyn. Seemed like a good mixology bar but our cocktails were all one-note too. Maybe they were having an off night but we were hit with a swinging door more than once and no one even said sorry. Way too loud and uncomfortable. Don't sit at the oyster bar! Weird place."

We tried to remain open and have come in a bunch of times - but every time I'm greeted with such cold service, changing menus, sometimes my drink is available and other times it's not, the hosts and waitstaff don't seem to know either. We appreciate the other Saraghina which has such a community vibe and solid offerings - hope they figure out how to be good neighbors and contribute to the life of the neighborhood.

M L.,/user_details?userid=-9xc2UfLsv8H60FB3XdsXw,"New York, NY",9/9/2022,5,I just moved to the neighborhood and had a really nice dining experience. I had initially made the wrong reservation for the wrong # of people on resy and it wouldn't let me change it and the hostess was gracious and helped move it to three and helped to accommodate a request for an outdoor table. Granted it was 6:15 but the place fills up early as the outdoor seating is wonderful for people watching during after work / early dinner hours. The service was excellent from the waitress to the busboys. Food was milanese italian style. A bit pricey but great for a neighborhood joint. Nice cocktail list. Pace of food was properly spaced. After being in the hamptons in the summer where the service is terrible and full of pretentious assholes it was nice to be back in brooklyn with some more diversity and nice people. Definitely will be back and hope to make it a neighborhood joint. I read some of the hypercritical reviews which was not my experience. Every time I walk by it has a good crowd going. They also have many gluten free options if you need.
M T.,/user_details?userid=-TMlxKw8dWtQdWF6c8HbgQ,"Brooklyn, NY",7/1/2022,1,"This place was horrific. I have never ever been so rudely treated. We waited for more than half an hour to be seated, which is even more ridiculous given that I was texted earlier that evening asking if I wanted to be seated early. Hostess told me, robot like, that she could not give me any information about the ""situation."" Wait staff could not remember any of our orders, which is concerning given that I have a sever shrimp allergy. Generally I do not understand how these people feel like it's okay to be so rude as a restaurant in nyc."

They also forgot to bring out the crudo we ordered and brought it at the very end of the meal. Also don't let them seat you at the raw bar, it's way too close to the kitchen and people are whizzing by with plates constantly, making it way too tight and uncomfortable to enjoy your meal."

Not only is the food spectacular (truffle arancini is highly recommended, crab ravioli is out of this world and all three desserts where outrageous but I particularly loved the tiramisu) plus the cocktails are superb as well (heavenly Negroni). The wine list is well curated by their excellent sommelier and all of the staff were very knowledgable as well as warm and friendly, shout out to Jazzy and Rhonda!

Laila P.,/user_details?userid=X81HHthtJLBJA3viHK5gWg,"New York, NY",4/22/2022,1,"I'm going to be honest here and tell you that I'm not really going to talk about the food. It was alright. I'm not a food critic and I'm not going to pretend to be. Was it worth the over $300 it cost? Not really, in my opinion. The steak was overwhelmingly salty, the portions were small and highly priced, the meringue was mostly whipped cream and I actually have no idea what part of it was meringue but I digress. I've had meals I enjoyed more for considerably less, but then again, my taste is not yours, and I am not going to impress it upon you. What I am going to talk about is the fact that Saraghina is one of the most egregious examples of  gentrification I have seen yet. The air is infected with a sort of wealthy self importance that I have never found even in small amounts to be pleasant, and especially not in this case, where it permeates the very tile. I was even rushed out after my exceptionally overpriced meal and told to leave because ""there are people waiting for your spot."" I am every bit sympathetic to accommodating other people, but the complete lack of tact with which it was brought up was palpable, like a cloying, sickly sweet perfume worn by someone with a demeanor that expresses cleanly and plainly that they think you are not worth their time. There are many beautiful and unique restaurants across New York City that display the vast array of cultures and people that live here. This embarrassingly over-gilded ""upper crust"" establishment is as far as anything can be from what makes NYC special, and I urge you to support smaller local businesses across the city that both need and actually deserve your patronage."

We had to wait about ten minutes to be seated. It was really packed! I can tell all of the workers have the best hustle and bustle mindset. They are quick with everything and the service is amazing too. They get everything done so fast and so well. They know how to do their job very well. We ordered a few plates to share and every dish came out so fast! Everything tasted sooooo good and it was so easy to share. The inside has a lot of seating that's very tightly spaced yet the perfect amount! I would definitely recommend this location and making a reservation ahead as well!

Waitress took my order quickly. Ordered dim sum items that were tasty. Got the spicy cucumbers, shumai, fried riblets and congee. My dim sum cravings were satisfied and would come again for sure."
Rick F.,/user_details?userid=lf1m4CbheuUR7fFZoLGRvA,"Chicago, IL",3/27/2023,5,"Located conveniently in Hell's Kitchen near our hotel, Dim Sum Palace provided us with a decent dining experience. The food and service were both middle of the road, with nothing truly outstanding or memorable. While we enjoyed our meal and had no complaints, we were hoping for a bit more of a ""wow"" factor. Despite this, Dim Sum Palace is definitely a solid choice for a quick and easy meal in the area, particularly if you're looking for some reliable dim sum."

The xiao long bao had a lot of soup but the soup was sweet which is strange. The sui mai was amazing. The jaw gap wrapper was really sticky and had a weird consistency that stuck to everything. Overall, it's not the best dim sum place especially for New York. I think I had very high expectations. Given the location though, I'm willing to go back and try some other classic dim sum places so that I can better judge their dim sum abilities."

The scallion pancake, soup dumplings and the spicy cucumber salad were the favorites but we also had the chicken dumplings, shrimp har gow and everything was excellent. I didn't take a photo in time because we landed, checked in, and ate quickly while chatting away. My sister had the Beijing Mule and it was a decent beverage. Everything was under 75$"

You must try the chicken feet. Oh my gosh that's so many different types of dumpling sauce is experiences. It is definitely if you've never done this a place that you must try and you must enjoy. I apologize for not having the pictures but oh my gosh I spent all my time eating not photographing because I was just so enthralled about eating. Definitely gotta eat here."

Get the shrimp and juicy pork dumplings. They are fantastic! That's what we had. Also we shared bbq pork dumplings and beef lo mein. Great lo mein. I wish it had a bit more veggies. Service was pretty fast but communication was poor. Besides the language barrier, our waiter simply forgot to tell us that they sold out spring rolls that we ordered and we only found out after waiting for some time and then asking. Our table for 2 was super tiny. It was the length of my forearm."

I've had so many past experiences in which I was desperately craving dim sum at 9 in the evening, and most dim sum restaurants either stop offering or close early. I came right after a Broadway show and I hadn't eaten anything for dinner, and I was shocked by how authentic and delicious everything was! I got soup dumplings and congee, and it was some of the best congee and XLB I've ever had. Service is really good and fast. I recommend paying with cash because you get a slight discount (they have a credit card fee). I would love to come back and try their other dishes. So good!"

Vivian A.,/user_details?userid=DSdn-0EoDKL4yivYh49gHQ,"Eastchester, NY",1/29/2023,5,"Honestly a very solid dim sum spot. They serve dim sum all day which is rare. The service was great and food was surprisingly authentic - I thought it would cater to the western palate more considering it's in Midtown but it's comparable to what you would get in Chinatown. The soup dumplings on the dim sum menu were also actual soup dumplings and not the tiny frozen ones. We got the pineapple fried rice and mostly dim sum dishes - shrimp shumai, chicken feet, turnip cakes with oyster sauce, soup dumplings (a must), spare ribs, sticky rice... I highly recommend if you're looking for comfort food in midtown."

I hope it has something to do with. We're always in a large group. But the food was delicious. We went with a big group which made it even more fun because we got to try a bunch of stuff. They had a ton to offer. It was really fairly priced. We fed a lot of people for not a lot of money. They let us sit there on Thanksgiving day and talk for hours. It was a wonderful experience."

Yes I understand it's NYC but damn $8 for 3 small pieces of chive and shrimp dumpling? Yes it was super tasty so worth the extra $$$. The cream bun was so soft, fluffy and the filling was perfectly sweet. It was a little runnier than I'm used to but the flavor was on point. The har gow and shu mai were solid too. Tip: ask for their hot sauces. It comes in a three pack with 3 different sauces- 1. Chili oil 2. Ginger-oil sauce 3. Sweet soy sauce. The ginger oil sauce was the best and really complimented the shu mai well. Will definitely be back for your delicious food!"

Amanpreet K.,/user_details?userid=1AY_LPBlf-g99tBvTR-eGg,"New York, NY",1/5/2022,4,"We stopped by Dim Sum Palace on a whim after finding out that Tim Ho Wan doesn't have soup dumplings (the reason we ventured out for dinner) and were able to grab a table right away. The dim sum menu has a wide selection of dumplings, meats and buns & their regular menu has quite a lot of options for main entrees as well. We decided to try a few different dumplings, including the pork soup dumplings which were delicious as well as the pork buns and scallion pancakes. The highlight for me was their sauces - so yum! The green beans were okay as well but not as seasoned as I would have liked. This is a solid dim sum spot in the neighborhood and we'll probably be back again at some point. Service was a bit slow at times but not a reason to stay away. Overall, I'd rate it at 4.5/5."
Krista M.,/user_details?userid=1r2QMLtYb_tKIH03hv1FQQ,"Redding, CT",1/7/2023,5,Stopped in before a show - great dim sum and good drinks.  Food was out quickly but we didn't feel rushed.  Would recommend.

Jessica D.,/user_details?userid=sQqrXK5nITcCUAGXxsyBJw,"Medford, NY",7/28/2022,4,"Will this be my first pick, no, but for a place that's open until 2:30 in the morning, it's a solid meal. While the dumplings were amazing the rice was slightly bland and had lots of chunks of white rice that hadn't taken on any seasoning. The menu was limited due to the time of night but that just confirms you are getting fresh food so I'm not mad about that!  Overall a great time eating and I would go again for a late night meal."
Yer T.,/user_details?userid=oti3QfK31v1wEeUs5mfaaA,"Sacramento, CA",5/20/2022,4,"First time here. Sisters wanted dim sum so we came here for a late dinner after watching a broadway show. Service was okay. We got seated right away. Took a while to get our order in and get water for everyone. The side of chili sauce didn't even come out until we practically finished our meal. Two of our orders were not entered in by our waiter so it never came out. We were pretty hungry so we finished every dish that came out. Food were pretty good and flavorful. Loved the taro buns. They came out nice and warm. The dumpling soup were yummy. The pork chop salt and pepper were good and thankfully it was not overly salted and/or covered in msg like other places. The sticky rice wrap is definitely smaller in size compared to the typical ones you get at other Chinese restaurants that serve dim sum. The pork and chive dumpling was okay. The chive is too overpowering compared to others that I've had. Overall, the food we had were yummy. The place was nice and cool compared to other places in the city that we've been too during our stay. The bathrooms were cleaned thankfully. It's definitely one of the cleanest ones we used in the city beside they place we stayed. Would come back if in the area in the future for more yummy dim sum."
Paula N.,/user_details?userid=u2GnE6Qz7djou3Es0pZ-rA,"New York, NY",1/3/2022,1,I found a piece of hair in the chicken lo mein. Our waiter was very apologetic and complimented us with a coconut cake. This is my first time experiencing this and it was a huge bummer... I see so many good reviews so I'm feeling mixed feelings about this spot
K R.,/user_details?userid=pUBAIMoRTWRMxKh-ys4Beg,"Hudson, NH",7/24/2022,5,"The staff is beyond fast! They get you what you want without hesitation. I started with a Lychi Martini and the presentation was beautiful and delicious! I had the shrimp steamed dumpling, spicy cucumber, vegetable spring roll and the spicy mushroom dumpling. Everything was served steaming hot and  full of flavor. I have absolutely no complaints. I watch a table of 9 walk in from the street and the staff didn't even hesitate to seat them. I'll be back!"

Jay R.,/user_details?userid=AdV6i_PMt-MEMcvbexHNAQ,"San Diego, CA",6/24/2022,3,"It's open late and within walking distance from your Broadway show...beggars can't be choosers.  No frills, decent dim sum with typical bad service you would expect from an authentic Asian restaurant.  Skip the chicken fried rice, everything else we ordered was decent."
Mary L.,/user_details?userid=YoV7pBbDW3mg07TMcRM8OA,"Oceanside, CA",11/11/2021,5,"Amazing! This was only 5 minutes away from our hotel, and it was awesome that we found it here on yelp. We placed an ordered for pick up after watching a show and it was ready in about 15 minutes. We had the shanghai fried rice, fish fillet with sweet and sour sauce, salt and pepper pork chop, shu mai and pork and chive dumplings. Everything was great! Highly recommend trying this place, we'll definitely be back when we come back to this city!"

That's not it's only asset though--it's also delicious! I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants in NYC, and there isn't another one quite like this. The flavors are unique and remind me of my childhood--I haven't had Chinese like this in NYC in decades. I highly recommend the Vegetable Chow Fun, the Buddha Delight Dumpling, the Bamboo Shoot Dumpling, and the Pan Fried Tofu with Seasonal Vegetable."

It came in a flavorful sauce though I wish it had a bit more spiciness. Service was ultra quick and attentive. They have a couple gender neutral restrooms."
Alexander R.,/user_details?userid=bUJ0Guzh3VdY2Dsq716PQA,"New York, NY",12/18/2022,2,I ate at the one on west 33rd street and it was the same no social contact just handed us menus and walked away if this was a prelude to anything I experienced at the 33rd st location then good thing I got up and left because the staff is devoid of any personality or suggestions to wats good on the menu more steamed crap in bamboo u can't be a chain and get the food wrong these reviews are not truthful good thing me and my.partner walked off and left before the experiencing the lack of.ambiance  and any other surprises when the bill came

The interior extends far deeper than you can call from the outside, and the decor is modern and comfortable. They were getting more crowded around noon on a weekend, but still plenty of space to get seated without a wait. The servers are really nice and the food comes out hot!! I really liked the shrimp dumplings and their cucumber salad is definitely worth it"
Vicky T.,/user_details?userid=_HHYniu8BVeSM0TYphVIHg,"Manhattan, NY",9/4/2022,1,Did not enjoy this restaurant at all. The dim sum sizes were large but if there is no flavor and it's unsanitary then it's not worth getting sick over.

The scallion pancakes were light and fluffy and not at all greasy, the noodles were full of flavor, and our chicken dish was wonderful. Portions are big, so you can definitely split meals!"

Allyson B.,/user_details?userid=COFV0pscu5ox3AzG9eQBwg,"Miami, FL",8/10/2021,4,First night in NY wandering g around and looking for a place to eat. So many places were dark. This was bright and lively and smelled so good so we stopped in for a bite. Excellent decision.  We had a variety of dim sum and it did not disappoint. We did jot leave but hey and really ate too much but who could leave that yummy goodness behind. Try it. You'll like it. And the service was prompt and efficient.
William L.,/user_details?userid=-rqIjbHXvLqFF4YOK3Ixng,"San Antonio, TX",1/17/2022,5,"Love, love, love the dim sum offered at this place.  I am so glad that they are staying open during this pandemic.  Their food is always delicious and is one of the few places that offer authentic dim sum in this town.  While I haven't been able to dine in during this pandemic, I appreciate the fact that they offer to-go options.  Their shu mai is one of the best in town, and I love all the offerings they have.  Most of their dim sum offerings are extremely savory, including those that are traditional to all Chinese people (chicken feet, pork intestines, beef tripe, etc.).  I would highly recommend this place if you want authentic dim sum in town."
Jon H.,/user_details?userid=GOQjimgFk_shAC3A6oJQ3w,"Las Vegas, NV",7/17/2022,5,I don't remember this night to well since I had been drinking with coworkers a street over. We sat outside and ordered several to share dim sum plates. We asked the server if they thought what we picked(6) would be enough and he told us no. So we ordered a few more(3-4) and waited. Shortly we had 2 then 5 plates and we started chowing down. We enjoyed them all.
Quinn B.,/user_details?userid=ZkeDDP0jBR-ElwAV9_fvrA,"Lilburn, GA",1/14/2023,4,"Nice little restaurant tucked out of the way. Great service and menu. Tasty Shumai and Veggie fried rice. But, duck spring rolls were basically tasteless and the garlic fried spare ribs were gristly and cooked with the bone which I didn't know until I took a bite and almost broke a tooth. However, the flavor was pretty good, especially when dipped in chili sauce!! I do recommend!"
Jacqueline L.,/user_details?userid=TUBquRAyQ6-5wM45ibRfDw,"Centerport, NY",11/1/2022,5,Fell into this restaurant after a show. Ate outside. Delicious isn't a strong enough word. The dim sum was fresh and mouth watering.  Shumai was gone before I could even eat any. But the most amazing dish was the chef's special seafood and chives. I will 100% return to have it again.

This one is located close to the Broadway theaters so it is geared towards the theater and tourist crowds. To be clear, this is far from the best dim sum in town. In fact there are now far better dim sum options in nearby Chelsea, but the dim sum at Dim Sum Palace is quick, filing, convenient and reasonably priced."

Anna L.,/user_details?userid=Gh7w8CRSOvNSuwWBSHNf_g,"New York, NY",1/8/2023,1,"Tasteless and overpriced place. We went there because it was the only place open at 11 pm. The food is blunt and overpriced. I know that Cantonese cuisine is not full of flavor but this one was the worst. The chicken was barely cooked which is unhealthy and same thing with the beef. Dishes don't come with rice, a small bowl is $2.50 and it's not on the menu. The service is okay and fast. We paid +$80 for tasteless food."

The crunchy shell compliments the shrimp. The crispy pork ribs were yummy but a little salty. The lotus leaf was good but needed more filling and flavor. So far the best dim sum I've had"
Tami F.,/user_details?userid=NtWce_6WwuD9BdjRk_j4tg,"Snohomish, WA",1/5/2023,4,"Solid dim sum. The restaurant is pretty small, so it can feel a little cramped. Some dishes are definitely more flavorful than others, but all were good. I'd go back!"
Jatin A.,/user_details?userid=qx1movYfGuQMe1tvrdpQkA,"New York, NY",7/6/2021,4,"Rozena says the rating of a dimsum place is to be based on the quality of its shumai. And, she thought the shumai here was decent but nothing too crazy. We felt the Mongolian beef was a tad too salty, and loaded with mushrooms. Other than that, the food is appetizing, with sufficient portions, and I'm thankful it was an option for us this late in the night. Also, the photos make the place appear much smaller than it actually is."

Got 2 orders of the shu mai and 2 orders of Shanghai dumplings. The wait for our food was the usual 20-30 minutes. Since we were staying in upstate New York, we decided to drive back to our Airbnb (2 hrs away) and eat our food there. After we got back, we started to take bites of our food, only to find that the shu mai wasn't even fully cooked. The pork and shrimp were STILL raw.. (pictures Included). First ever coming across uncooked shu mai. Rather upset since this was going to be our dinner for the night.."

The food was THE BEST DIM SUM I've ever had and I had dim sum at a lot of places! My fav was their taro bun and bamboo shoot dumplings. I've also never had veggie hot and sour soup which I was pleasantly surprised with. We ended the night with their oolong tea and it was the perfect pairing for our palette.

The lady at the front  was being rude when we asked for more sides. As we got our bill that came out to $100. We decided to tip $5 on the table. The lady came back with the bill complaining about how we only tipped $5 and that we're required to tip more. It's very rude to ask for more tip when she wasn't the one serving our table.

Restaurant in a warm busy basement and service was excellent. We had sour flounder and mushroom soup that was enhanced with pickled cabbage. Also shared duck with mushrooms and five flavor sauce that was huge but could have had stronger spicing. With freezing weather I was not eager to drag down to china town and this place made the grade. We'll be back.

Payal B.,/user_details?userid=gWxrFxQsyIwu3Vyc2ruw0A,"Oceanside, CA",7/24/2022,5,Special birthday dinner for my son. The food was EXCELLENT!!! The service was great and the portions were plentiful. We got the Peking duck carved table side. The entire experience was great.
Mary D.,/user_details?userid=H6zHdaEAlva1FdBSClY_QA,"North Heights, Youngstown, OH",8/15/2022,2,"Really disappointed. I was so excited and most of the reviews were good. I got the bbq pork buns and they were just okay. Not the kind of dough I was expecting. They kind of seemed like they were wrapped in cheap white bread. The vegetable spring rolls were good and the best thing I ordered. I could not finish my chicken dumplings and threw them away, something tasted very off. I also had the lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice and pork. The flavor was good but I didn't like that it was filled with random pork like it was made from leftovers. Some chopped, some shredded and sausage. It was weird."
Katie L.,/user_details?userid=UAo3FWTqRHXWH0os8M0jqg,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",3/27/2021,5,"I'm half Cantonese and grew up with a dim sum loving father so I was pleasantly happy with Dim Sum Palace! It was on the pricey side but I much preferred eating here than finding a hole in the wall in Chinatown. The food was delicious, the restaurant was clean, and the service was good. No complaints and my dim sum cravings were satisfied!"

Not super spicy, but has a nice kick to it. If I find my way back to New York City, I'm definitely going back to this restaurant."
Sheldon T.,/user_details?userid=ewcr2o-RYtfqUB7ceIFTLg,"Tustin, CA",6/28/2022,2,"We went to there to eat for a dinner and ordered one fish cruise. The menu said it is a full fish. Once it came, it is just a half fish facing down. It is bit disappointed  and tried to raise this issue with the waitress who said it contains a full fish -- a obvious lie."
Melinda M.,/user_details?userid=4ok_ImqQY3GxtIdH-bTTiQ,"Dakota Crossing, Winnipeg, Canada",9/30/2022,4,"Really good dim sum. Service was efficient and quick. Even during happy hour most tables were taken (we went today sept 30th) so presumably much busier during peak hours. Go for Happy Hour Monday to Friday from 3-5pm and pay 50% for most dishes on Dim Sum menu. They exclude two in that deal. Also beers are $4 a bottle - not $3 as noted in their happy hour ad online. Also, please note if you pay with a card they charge a ""convenience  fee"" of 3.5% for the privilege of using a card. I would recommend you bring cash. In Canada this is not legal and I guarantee that 3.5% is more than the credit card charges the business. So a cash grab for sure. There is a sign on the door letting you know of this fee before you enter. There are a few businesses in NYC which charge an extra amount to use a card but not all. So pay attention."

Rose W.,/user_details?userid=yV9zI6dmWuWK9-gdYJ-06Q,"Manhattan, NY",5/1/2022,5,My parent's favorite restaurant in NYC! They've eaten almost at every Chinese restaurant in the area and this spot is  our go to spot for an authentic meal. The chef is a master and can make anything you request - even off the menu! Sometimes we'd crave dishes not listed on their menu and it would always be made to perfection. The quality of ingredients is superb for an affordable no frills restaurant. Really great people running this place it's become our family's neighborhood favorite!
Mindy B.,/user_details?userid=GQXpDWzPitRSl7wGl9wUng,"William's Court, College Station, TX",7/5/2022,5,"Delicious! The juicy chicken dumplings were amazing,the orange chicken was excellent. Great service, especially considering that we did outdoor dining. Thumbs up from me, spouse, and two kids (one who is not an adventurous eater and loved it--wants to come back tomorrow!)"
D G.,/user_details?userid=ALgOtu3CNYAwM1GdWkaF8A,"San Diego, CA",4/3/2022,5,"This place is awesome. We came here for an after theatre meal. We ordered a variety of dumplings, Peking duck and some soup It was such a treat to have dim sum, especially late at night. The Peking duck was the best Peking duck we've had in long time. The buns were fluffy and they were very generous with the meat filling. The XLB dumplings were also very generously-sized and flavorful. We also had a really good taro bun for dessert. Service was quick and good too. If I'm ever in NYC craving a late night Chinese meal near the theatre district, then this place will be at the top of the list."
Kate D.,/user_details?userid=w5zQj3hiSuIOsRe8f-_ybQ,"Fairfield, CT",9/14/2022,4,"Late night option available to the entire theatre district. We got out of the Pearl Jam show at MSG and needed a bite that was delivered to our hotel...we ordered traditional Chinese dishes which were tasty & not overly oily or saucy/did the trick - if I were to go again, I would order the steamed dim sum options that looked really good in reviews!"
Nick C.,/user_details?userid=PPTV5ry-LXvA1lEQMosdow,"Manhattan, NY",9/16/2021,4,"I was looking around for a place to eat and I had been walking along 46th Street at the time. I saw dim Sum Palace and my choice was made. I had never been there before and the dim sum menu displayed on the outside of the restaurant looked very appealing. I went in and was directed to a table. It took some time for someone to come by but they brought me a glass of water when they did. I looked over the menu and ordered a variety of dumplings which I really like. He came back and told me I too much of the same thing and in order to have a better experience, I should have a variety. I then made other choices based on his suggestions. My dumplings and other choices arrived [shrimp dumplings, shu mai, shanghai juicy buns and shrimp rolls] I was really partial to the dumplings. I was glad that I had not ordered too much more since it would have been difficult to finish it all. It is a nice sized place, reasonably priced for the area and I would recommend and return. I would probably next time explore the menu a little further."

Ashley C.,/user_details?userid=hYz8-X3tK6uVQ3TB3lbddw,"Mountain View, CA",10/9/2021,3,"This place has lots of hype on yelp but it was honestly just okay. Get the shu mai and bbq pork buns but don't bother with the szechuan wontons, they are way too salty. Very meh, kind of expensive. I'm from the bay area and they do dim sum better there."
Chris J.,/user_details?userid=fOIfV0Tx8Q4xE5_upnGWPQ,"Alhambra, CA",3/19/2022,5,This dim sum place is sooooooo good.  I am from LA where we have tons of dim sum places but it's not comparable to the dim sum here.  Definitely a must do
Angelica Q.,/user_details?userid=I-RtzReIQmkVN2LjW1WSXg,"San Jose, CA",7/18/2021,4,"If you're looking for dim sum, you've found it. But if you're looking for CHEAP dim sum, you have to keep looking. This place serves quality dishes -- flavorful, springy texture, piping hot -- but there are definitely better deals in Chinatown. However, this place does serve some pretty cool cocktails, so if you're looking to have alcohol alongside your meal, this might be the place for you. If you do come, get the xiu mai -- that was our table favorite :)"
Elizabeth F.,/user_details?userid=nrUpGbeHcUiaJO3spHaoUA,"Princeton, NJ",10/14/2022,4,Great for a pre-theater dinner - food was good - service was very quick.  Soup dumplings were excellent.  The shrimp shui mai were good and we also ordered the pork buns.

All I can hope is that the food served here is not authentic dim sum. I ordered the dim sum platter to get a little taste of several items. With the exception of one item, they were all gummy, stuck to my chopsticks, and lacked any real flavor. By the time I got to the last two, I was just breaking them open to eat the filling, and even that wasn't good. The best part of the platter was the sauces. I also ordered the hot and sour soup, which was good. Service was also lackluster, they never even asked how my food was, or checked in after I received my order. However when I said that was done, they seemed to be in a hurry to get me out. I appreciated that because I was very ready to leave."
Judy D.,/user_details?userid=8DL7x0yl28_kKdFh5Ko3vg,"Fort Pierce, FL",8/12/2022,4,Fast service and delicious food!  Came during  happy hour and the drinks were perfection.  The bamboo and pork dim sum was our favorite.

However like most of the outdoor dinning, the tables were not exactly 6 feet apart from each other and there was no social distancing. We ordered the dim sum dishes from shrimp dumplings to shumai to taro cake, and they were all spot on and authentic. We also got a pot of rose tea and it was just right. The service was efficient with just the right amount of attention. At the end of the night, our waiter came to our table with a bottle hand sanitizer and gave one to two pumps for each one of us."

Loved the dumplings and the general Tso's chicken.  Liked the trio of sauces for the dumplings especially the ginger in oil. Convenient location for our NY theater experience.  Service was excellent.  Price was reasonable for NYC.  We were both happy to discover this restaurant and try something different on restaurant row.

Aj L.,/user_details?userid=YhFJd8sr03j032wM7_6w6g,"NY, NY",12/28/2021,1,Came a few months back and had a few extra ingredients in my pineapple fried rice. Those extra ingredients included a few BUGS that immediately turned my stomach sour. After telling the server he proceeded to comp my rice however I already had eaten half of the plate. Obviously this left me feeling  uncomfortable and I won't be returning. Just please examine your food before you eat it.

Helia J.,/user_details?userid=D67w76HBcjMtmlpQJcUDqg,"Thousand Oaks, CA",8/23/2021,5,Chicken dumplings were the best ones I've had in a dim sum place ever! Shrimp dumplings were amazing and I also loved the bbq pork buns a lot! The garlic crispy pork rib is good if you like something crunchy  but it is bone in which I personally didn't mind.
Lexi S.,/user_details?userid=iR9JRx9ZW9w-WjiPR0QvUg,"Libertyville, IL",9/4/2021,5,"BEST DUMPLINGS EVER!!!!!! YOU NEED TO COME HERE! I enjoyed the platter variety and two orders of the juicy pork dumplings. Better than any Chinatown!! Located in Hell's Kitchen and so close to Times Square-- I would fly to NYC just to visit the Dim Sum Palace for these dumplings. Each bite was loaded with flavor, filled with a generous amount of stuffing, so the portions were filling and worth every penny! Such reasonable prices too. The broth that was filled in the juicy pork dumplings was out of this world, AMAZING, I could eat those dumplings for the rest of my life and not get sick of it! Each bite made to perfection. I loved that there was a platter that offered a variety so you can try multiple kinds! I wish they had a dessert platter because all the sweet dumplings sounded delicious! Overall, I highly recommend coming here!!! You will not regret it."

Let me tell you, we didn't just go there once but four times for lunch and dinner. We know we won't be disappointed. We didn't eat much of the dim sum, but we ordered the main dishes and they were great. We had shrimp siu mai, lobster with ginger, mixed seafood with chives, crispy chicken, roasted duck, crispy noodles with seafood, beef chow fun, fried rice, Chinese broccoli, vegetable soup with tofu, and crispy seafood, they were all tasty and fresh. When you eat their food you don't feel like they take short cut. Work the money!"

Pete G.,/user_details?userid=IpZjrg0zDcKE0QLo1BMofg,"New York, NY",5/26/2022,1,"Any place that calls itself ""palace"" should be automatically suspect. You certainly won't be treated like a king or queen here, given the staff's blase attitude towards long delays in service, without even taking the time to explain or apologize for snafus. The servers and even the manager make you feel like more of a serf or slave in the palace. Given how they stand around chatting instead of bringing you your food after a 25 min wait (our unfortunate situation, when the restaurant was not even full), or even deigning to explain order errors, it seems they see themselves as the royalty. I realize there may be cultural differences between Chinese restaurants and most other NY or even US restaurants, and as a New Yorker I don't expect to be coddled or cowtowed to, BUT I do expect the common decency of an explanation and apology for inevitable screw-ups. This is apparently beyond the abilities or inclinations of the staff at this restaurant, after our 25 min wait between some dim sum and our mains, before walking out, without so much of an apology uttered by any of the staff, until we were visible angry. Moreover the small amounts of food we did get were mediocre and overpriced. Skip Dim Sum Palace, in favor of any of the other nearby Chinese restaurants where you'll be treated as a paying customer, rather than second or third class citizen. There are literally countless better options that won't ruin your evening."
Jessie D.,/user_details?userid=Loqo23l_4emHLQOh0UclQA,"Brooklyn, NY",1/11/2022,4,Really good dumplings and other dim sum. The o door seating was heated and the staff was attentive. They also have another midtown location on 56th and 5th that's good as well.

Jack Y.,/user_details?userid=OcAiepjJqB-unxNUvBJScA,"Hartsdale, NY",1/18/2022,4,"We went to the Dim Sum Palace on W 56 St. Normally, when we want Chinese food, we would go to Chinatown, but we happen to be in midtown and we had a previous experience dining at another Dim Sum Palace and remember that the food was pretty decent. We ordered some dim sum and 2 noodle dishes. The dishes were as good as what we would get eating in Chinatown, just a little more expensive (expected since we were in midtown, Manhattan). If you live near a Dim Sum Palace or happen to be in the neighborhood, I would recommend eating there."

Kylee W.,/user_details?userid=oRFzcTvgR_HEuu9U8YFaIg,"Chesapeake, VA",6/9/2021,5,This place! I wish I was local because this would be my go-to. I have been craving this place since I left NY! I am from VA and have contemplated jumping in my car to pick up some dumplings!!! The soup dumplings had so much soup and so much flavor! They were by far my favorite thing that I tried. The egg rolls on point and crispy! I didn't love the egg buns but that's mostly because I had a mishap with the yolk  so my fiancé finished them (he loved them)! I would highly recommend this place and encourage you to try multiple dishes but the soup dumplings are a must!!!

It was packed so it's clearly popular. But the options were disappointing and the food itself left a lot to be desired. The food was sufficient for a late night dinner but I wouldn't go back.

I've had excellent dim sum in Philadelphia and I was excited to try dim sum palace given its long list of positive reviews and high Yelp rating. We asked our waiter to help us navigate the menu expecting he would know what the restaurant is best at preparing. He kindly picked out several dishes he thought we'd enjoy. Unfortunately we disliked nearly all of them. I'd recommend the soup dumplings and scallion pancakes, that's about it."
Taylor N.,/user_details?userid=49A1h-f8xMDVsANomX6iww,"San Diego, CA",10/16/2021,5,"I don't think I've had real dim sum until I ate here.  Like, this is what it's supposed to taste like? Freaking mind blowing where you just have to chew in silence and appreciate the experience because you know it's a special one. The skin on dumpling is so thin, the filling so fresh, tender, and flavorful. Duck eggrolls, what?? Delish. I ate here 3 times already on my one week trip lol. The menu is not that extensive but boy are they good at what they do. In contrast to Awesome Dimsum which I thought was just mediocre. This rating is including dim sum from SF (good), Shanghai/hong kong (pretty freaking great). If you love dim sum and are from out of town you MUST go here."

They don't take reservations but the wait has never been more than 20 min on a sat/Sunday during lunch. Pick off of the picture menu and write in the number of items you want.- Dim Sum starts coming out. 4 ppl can eat until stuffed for ~ $120."

To my surprise I got seated right away. I believe it is because dim sum is mostly a breakfast concept. Chicken juicy bun, which is chicken soup dumpling, was excellent. Other places like Joe's Shanghai sells excellent pork soup dumplings. Chicken soup dumplings is not that common. Dumpling didn't have a ton of soup, but with some chilli oil taste was excellent. Egg yolk creamy bun was my favorite though. Bun was very soft and there is cream flowing from the center. I am trying chicken feet for the first time. It had a weird taste and texture as I expected. It does not have regular chicken meat. There is a getting used to for that. Chicken dumplings were good, but not as good as chicken juicy dumplings. Prices were reasonable."

Next was braised duck. Hard pass. Very little meat, weird texture from preparation.  it was just not prepared right. Peking was $7 more and I kinda wish I tried that instead. Last dish was the steamed fish in black sauce. Incredible. This is one of my go to dishes at any Chinese restaurant that serves it. It's a fresh, relatively healthy and delicious dish. The sauce and fish over steamed rice is just one of those simple pleasures. Besides the duck, my only other  criticism of this place is it's expensive!"

We ordered shu mai, shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, turnip cakes, pork soup dumplings, congee, rice rolls, bbq pork buns, rice wrapped in banana leaves, cucumber salad, and tea. The food here is not as flavorful and powerful as some other dim sum spots in the city. This was especially evident in the cucumber salad, it was spicy, but the other flavors of tangy/salty I was expecting were not there. The turnip cakes were the best dish I thought. They were flavorful and lightly fried to perfection with a delicious sauce. The congee and rice in banana leaves were also very good. BBQ pork buns were also delicious although lacking a little bit in amount of filling. All the other dishes got the job done, but were not spectacular.  They don't have the carts here (so if you're looking for that experience, this is not the place). Prices were also a little bit on the higher side, and they charged for tea. Good dim sum, but if you're looking for a mind blowing and authentic experience with carts, go to Chinatown."

We shared the shrimp dumplings, shredded roast duck dumplings, Shanghai juicy pork buns, pan fried tiny buns, cucumbers with Szechuan spicy sauce, and scallion pancakes. I enjoyed everything (except the cucumbers, which as predicted were too spicy for me, but spice lovers will enjoy them) and it was more than enough food. Standout for me was the shrimp dumplings."
Judy C.,/user_details?userid=YPNHNqdGy6F2T2I8372Hmw,"Manhattan, NY",9/2/2021,5,"Ate here twice in one week. We had & enjoyed turnip cake, mushroom, duck, seafood with peashoots dumplings. We had liked the bbq chicken feet. The only disappointment was the scallion pancake which was on the bland side. Staff very gracious & accomdating."

We called for takeout lunch but ended up eating it at their outdoor seating area as it was empty at the time. Waiters were lovely and frequently refreshed our tea pot. We had the crab juicy pork dumpling (soup dumpling), both the pan fried and steamed pork and chive dumplings, both the chicken and the shrimp and pork shu mai, chicken dumplings, chicken feet, beef chow fun, and mapo tofu. Everything was DELECTABLE - everything tasted clean, bright, savory - nothing oily or heavy or salty. A fantastic meal, kids were sooooo happy with the lunch I can't wait til we can make it back!"

amanda s.,/user_details?userid=FP7YquiHgFYY_6vqW_4qrQ,"Alpharetta, GA",1/13/2021,5,This spot has always been a MUST DO as soon as we arrive in NY. We literally get a taxi and head straight there suitcases and all LOL. When you arrived be prepared to see a lively packed restaurant that is moving pretty fast. You see many people sitting close by with lots of happy customers. Since Covid you can no longer sit inside but they do have outdoors dining. They hand you a piece of paper to choose your selections of dim sum then within minutes you have your orders flying out of the kitchen. They have the BEST egg yolk dim sum. The best!!! Omg my mouth is watering writing this. The best news ever is that you can have your food delivered to you!! Please go. They have many other locations too. Our heart is located in the Times Square location. Enjoy.

We also ordered a platter of different dumplings which was a mistake, as many of them had different wrappers then we were used to. I know now to stick to the basics. A lot of the wrappers were very gummy and thick, and I would love if there was more of a description in the menu for what the platters would contain. We had a good experience and would return to enjoy a nice dinner in Midtown."

Now that I'm more used to the price level in midtown I find the pricing here quite reasonable compared to some other places where the pricing is simply outrageous. The food was good - it could be better but given the price level you shouldn't expect really top quality food. I'd say the food is decent enough. Some of the dishes might have been kept warm for a bit too long, but in this way they got to serve everything quickly, and the flavors were still good, so I got no complaint for that."
Eric S.,/user_details?userid=0br2gHdI6GneQKlfo4kKDQ,"Scottsdale, AZ",5/6/2021,5,This is the best dim sum place I've ever been to. It's even better now than it was before the pandemic they have an outside covered patio where you can eat which is great.!!
Diana H.,/user_details?userid=AY3UE8BQ4hrR4_2QWILQ8w,"Portland, OR",1/23/2019,4,Really good dim sum in the heart of Times Square! If dining solo just ask to bring them one at a time so the little dumplings stay piping hot! The staff is most accommodating. The jasmine tea is wonderful and made in a pot (not bagged) and the condiments are just divine.  A great pre-theatre spot!

We went here because it opens late on a Wednesday... but the food did not taste good. I could not swallow down the chicken soup dumpling. The congee was edible but couldn't finish. By the time I got to eat half of it along with some other dishes, my tummy was starting to feel weird. Food didn't taste very fresh. The soup in the dumplings tasted watered down (we tried the pork soup dumplings as well). We had to ask for extra dipping sauces several times ... and when they finally brought it out to us. There was only one extra set of sauces."

I was shocked to find this place and was even more pleased how good it was! Had the shumai, shrimp dumplings, radish cake and seafood and peashooter dumplings. Everything was great. My only complaint was that though the exterior of the radish cake was crispy, the inside was way to gelatinous and so the consistency was waaaay off. They have a bunch of interesting veggie options and after 3pm dim sum is 50% off! Can't really ask for much more."

I tried their taro cilantro pork dumplings (my favorite), shumai, the classic delicious shrimp dumplings, scallion pancakes, and the egg yolk creamy buns. Just thinking about their buns is making me drool, it was a delicious dessert (a sweet, warm, and smooth liquid-like filling inside the bun). Not only was their dimsum delicious, but their entrees were fantastic as well! I'm coming back for more!"

My wife and I love dim sum so we're always down for it. Service was good here and dim sum was delicious! It's not that far from Times Square either. Open late and hits the spot if you want yummy soup dumplings and shu mai in NYC!
Rose I.,/user_details?userid=Q8-8qyKnbgq2cAWGFHZB5Q,"Manhattan, NY",9/29/2018,4,"If you're midtown (or just don't want to trek to Chinatown in Manhattan, Queens, or Brooklyn), you can get your fix of a variety of dim sum here. You won't see the rolling carts but the menu is vast and has pictures. Service is efficient and taste meets expectations"

Brandon W.,/user_details?userid=b36LfHFi6A-tjTqVkijDuA,"Rochester, MI",11/12/2019,4,"Traveling to New York in search of dim sum, one of the first places I checked out was Dim Sum Palace. Located near Time Square away from the other chinatowns, I was not sure how authentic the dim sum would be. We ordered the platter that had a mix of different dim sum that I was excited to try, since most dim sum restaurants do not offer this type of mixed dish. The variety was good, but the cost was a bit high, likely based on location. There is no cart pushing here, but that meant the dishes came out hot and fresh. Overall a good dim sum place to try if you have never had dim sum before, but for a more authentic experience would head to one of the chinatowns."

Thanks to previous Yelpers reviews I found this little dim sum restaurant tucked away on a side street in Times Square. Enjoyed half off dumplings because it was Happy hour (3-5pm) The shrimp dumplings were fresh and the dough was light and chewy. The siu mai ( pork/shrimp) were tasty too. The steamed pork bao were tasty and had a soft and chewy dough. The service was pleasant and fast, but not rushed. Not fancy but clean restaurant interior .  Definitely will be back."

It was walking distance from my school, so super convenient to get to. I was kind of hesitant to try any sort of Chinese restaurant in Midtown, since it probably wouldn't be authentic but it actually surpassed my expectations! I think the food authenticity matches anything you could find in Chinatown or Flushing, but a little more expensive and nicely plated. We got har gow (shrimp dumplings), shu mai (pork meatballs wrapped in wonton shell), soup dumplings, chicken feet, spinach and egg steamed dumplings, pan fried buns, and lotus leaf wrapped steamed rice and meat. Overall a good meal, came out to ~$60 for the 3 of us. Would come again if I wanted to eat at a Chinese place in midtown!"

Derick D.,/user_details?userid=mAEDNNfI_ryZcrmIR72QKA,"Miami, FL",7/24/2019,3,"Update: Dim Sum prices on menu are cheaper than what they end up charging you. They charged us $2 more for every item we ordered compared to the price on the menu. The dim sum was good, but not as great as I remember during my initial visit. The up charge in price doesn't make it as affordable to try as many things. $2 makes a lot of difference especially when some of the portions only contain 3 pieces. Not sure if we ordered from an outdated menu, or if they just tried to pull a quick one on the check."
Michael F.,/user_details?userid=IwXYgmWhWlIBvkrhGyLT4Q,"The Bronx, The Bronx, NY",3/30/2022,1,This place is trash. Probably really good if your drunk but if your looking for flavorful food or a nice dinning experience this is NOT the place. Wayyy over priced and disgusting. I ordered pineapple cheese wontons which was disgusting (thought I'd try something new) way too sweet and hot on the outside and freezing cold on the inside...next where the vegetables rolls which where really good. Fresh vegetables inside so lucky no seasoning wasn't hurting it much. And then was the chicken mai (chicken and mushroom dumplings).... They where the worst!  I'm pretty sure they where undercooked and absolutely NO flavor. Even with the sauces they provide it's still HORRIBLE!!! For an entree I hand general so chicken and I applaud them for using chicken breast for the chunks but once again no flavor or season on the chicken or the batter. Just bland very underwhelming. In all I spent $40 and left with my stomach unsettled from poor food preparation and cooking. I sent back the pineapple cheese wontons and truthfully I wanted to get up and leave the whole meal and not pay since I only had a few bites. It's rare I got to a place and everything i orders is not good... save your money or get drunk first. And another tip... the waiters are just for ordering your food. They don't answer any questions..
Val A.,/user_details?userid=KZgQB0WrP7LbYvjIkBxwYQ,"Reseda, CA",7/10/2019,5,"Los Angeles definitely needs more dim sum spots just like this! The Taro cilantro pork dumplings, Pork and chive dumplings , shumai, shrimp dumplings and crispy garlic spareribs we're superb! Very flavorful, fresh and not too oily like many dim-sum spots. When you walk in it looks small but there's more seating in the back. We spent about $100 (3 adults and a toddler)I recommend having dim-sum here."

I always forget seasoning is different in different cultures. If you are looking for heavy to medium seasoning I wouldnt say this place isnt for you. Everything does have flavor but its not seasoned in the way commerical places do it. The Pork buns were so soft and delicious. The Pan fried buns were perfect and yummy. The Soup Dumplings.. Oh My Gah.  The General Tsos was pretty good. The noodles werent as spicy as we wished but I would say I wouldnt order noodles from here. Overall, it was great.

We enjoyed all of our food except for the duck dumplings, which was completely overwhelmed and drowned out by the bamboo stuffing. A favorite was the shrimp and chives, as there were plenty of chives with juicy, tender shrimps. The siu mai, although small, were very tender and juicy as well, and you can tell that they used some good meat or the filling. It makes me want to try their steamed pork ribs! I also wish they had rice rolls (cheung fun), but I guess I should be happy enough that I can get dimsum in the evenings. It's a bit pricey overall, but I'm assuming NY is like that? I haven't been to enough dimsum joints in the area to get a feel for the standard, so for now I'll leave it as a 4."

Hong Kong style, flavorful and on the sweeter side just how I like it. I loved the sauce so much, I even dipped it with my Shumai, which complimented it just fine. Most of their dim sum dishes revolves around dumplings unfortunately. I really wished they had the pork puff but they didn't. Their custard bun though, was simply amazing. Perfect way to end the meal. If you have a late night dim sum craving, definitely stop by here. Get a chrysanthemum hot tea while you're at it."

Ken R.,/user_details?userid=wbo9cu0PX_wjh6IHFhM59A,"Del Mar, San Diego, CA",8/16/2017,4,Great place to grab a quick lunch before a matinee. If you love dim sum try this place. I am not the biggest fan of the restaurants with the dim sum carts because the food is not piping hot. This place allows you to order what you want when you want it and it is brought straight from the kitchen to your table. This would rank 4.5 stars if the service was better.
Jessica M.,/user_details?userid=RiuiWlHdAn4PmWKuSgqpxg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12/15/2020,5,"The Dim Sum Palace is amazing! The service is great and it is definitely matched by the food. Not to mention the drinks are fantastic! Personal Favorites: Shrimp dumplings, sweet and sour fish filet, and mango mojito!"

Paul J.,/user_details?userid=bhKPTru9Av_lP5OfNMbc4A,"Bethesda, MD",4/3/2019,5,"When you're sitting around on a Wednesday afternoon, waiting for the matinee show to begin, and your stomach grumbles, what do you do?  Especially if you have a craving for good Chinese food?  Head on over to Dim Sum Palace for authentic, yummy Dim Sum.  We ordered the standard stuff: BBQ pork buns, pan fried dumplings, pan fried tiny buns, pork and chive dumplings, shrimp dumplings, and sweet sesame balls.  We also tried the crispy green tea rice balls, which I've never seen before, but it was worth it.  Each dish had its own flavor, appeared to be freshly made (i.e., not frozen), and tasted great.  Everyone in the party had something they liked, and it was tasty enough for everyone to try something they hadn't had before.  So, if you need a Dim Sum fix in mid-town Manhattan, go do Dim Sum Palace and bring an empty belly - it'll fill up quick!"

John Y.,/user_details?userid=TorGUD6XwCAzg0JrrN2Cig,"Cambridge, MA",5/30/2019,4,"It came down to this place or Tim Ho Wan. Since Dim Sum Palace was in midtown, this was the choice for us. Staff are friendly and the ambiance was relaxed and nice, but not like the FOB asian joints. We had the chicken feet, a few plates of rice noodles, shu mai, etc. Typical/common stuff. Food was okay. It didn't blow me away or disappoint me. This place does offer peking duck, on a price per person basis. They also have other luncheon offerings like a traditional asian restaurant...so this place is not solely for dim sum only."

I was sitting in my hotel about to order uber eats when something said, look for a local dim sum place then low and beyond, I found not a ""place"" but a ""palace"". Every dim sum I tried was delicious in this dim sum honey hole!"

Tony R.,/user_details?userid=h0CvRLRx8grsteP6qYTdnw,"Las Vegas, NV",5/29/2019,4,What a nice surprise this was at one in the morning sober with the family. Shrimp rolls and veggie rolls and duck rolls. Chicken fried rice was huge. Owner is very gracious and friendly staff. This is a must

Rocco 2.,/user_details?userid=HlNdS7sKeSqeXcEx8wp85g,"Mountain Lakes, NJ",7/20/2021,5,Hidden Gem. I'd rather eat here than a hibachi. Great food. Best fried rice I've eaten. Fresh ingredients Just wow..

I hope their business gets boosted since I am sure they will be getting a lot of leftover people. Interior is pretty basic, like a normal Chinese restaurant. There is a decent variety with all the classic dim sum dishes but nothing too out there. They did forget our shu mai but didn't get charged for it so no worries there. They also charge for tea. I only have on friend I really go to dimsum with but since this place is so small it ends up working out. We always order way too much and have leftovers. Will definitely be coming here again. Might be my staple dim sum spot."
Kyla Z.,/user_details?userid=tNDCrQSvGzu2lJvglQLldg,"Chester, VA",5/9/2017,4,Another inexpensive gem in the theatre district.   We ordered lots of choices.  The pork bun was my favorite.  Don't order the fruit plate.  Also the atmosphere was weird.  They played late 90s and early 2000s girl rock songs (Think Spice Girls).
Earthh R.,/user_details?userid=ZiBNCkjGEKIA4RvVE1Umhg,"Maui, HI",7/18/2021,5,This is the best Hong Kong food I've ever put in my mouth. Amazing food.  Not the greatest service but food is freaking awesome. Please go and try it out.

I almost always come here before seeing a Broadway show because they're fast, rarely overly crowded, have good service, and the dimsum is delicious, authentic, and really hits the spot. Really recommend the dimsum ""classics"": shrimp dumpling (har gow), Shu Mai, sweet egg yolk creamy bun. The other items are a little more hit-or-miss in terms of freshness & authenticity. The shredded roasted duck stir-fried turnip cake in XO sauce is also very yummy!"

It's a small place, and not one of the large bustling restaurants that you might see in Chinatown.  They have a menu of fairly standard Chinese fair, and a separate menu for dim sum items. They also have a bar and you can order wine beer and cocktails. The dim sum was very good, though nothing extraordinary. The service was fairly good, though a little abrupt. Overall, a decent dim sum location with fairly reasonable prices near Times Square. You can get more authentic dishes if you go to Chinatown, but this is a great option that won't disappoint."

It was the closest dim sum place to our hotel and I'm glad we went to it. I ordered soup dumplings, shumai, duck dumplings, and the Peking duck! Pecking duck was so crispy with the skin and tasted so good! And I don't even like duck lol. Would come back again! Only giving 4 stars because they didn't have my all time favorite dim sum available. Oh and clean restrooms as well!"

Heather S.,/user_details?userid=SwP-wrWkPGynwEuad_BAGA,"San Francisco, CA",11/12/2018,3,One of the few places that serves dim sum all day and also not in Chinatown. It's also great that it's all fresh made to order as opposed to made in big batches and pushed on a cart getting cold. The dim sum itself is ok. Not the best but also not the worst. Would I come here again? Probably not but I am glad I did experience it.

Victoria O.,/user_details?userid=Fa1wKdbzCJIuLWLF071oyw,"Houston, TX",7/12/2018,4,This was just a few blocks away from Time Square. I was craving Dim Sum during my vacation in NY. I saw this on here and gave it a try. I went around 11pm and there were a lot of customers which was a good sign. I ordered a variety of dim sum and a must have bowl of rice . The dim sum was great and the garlic spare ribs was delicious. The only one I didn't like much was the hot and sour soup. It was kind of bland. Over all I'll give this place a 4/5.

Their duck dish is a decent amount of food. Convenient location, nice place, good service. I'll be back here on a regular basis since I have recurring errands in the area."
Ellen L.,/user_details?userid=yN44ch3-eK2c1krS-lafEA,"New York, NY",7/20/2019,3,"It was ok, found the dim sum tasty but over priced. Staff was very attentive. Not likely top go back."
Payel K.,/user_details?userid=KFT3OtZnjrkbZoZO5I6clA,"Edison, NJ",3/30/2018,3,"I went here by myself so couldn't try too many things. They have an exhaustive menu and may be my choices weren't the best. I tried the taro, pork and cilantro dumpling as well as the fresh mushroom one. While I enjoyed the mushroom dumpling, wasn't a fan of the taro-pork-cilantro one. I would want to go back and try some other ones."
James K.,/user_details?userid=326GdLHRnXZrXAUsxoA2uQ,"New York, NY",11/18/2018,4,Delicious dimsum place. lots of yummy dimsum! There is long waiting everytime. Weekday happy hour is good option. Love this place.
M R.,/user_details?userid=vHeXeV-5DfLVkYoSket7ZA,"Melbourne Beach, FL",12/23/2019,4,We went on a Sunday night approximately 6:15 pm and were told there would be at 15-20 minute wait. They were right. We were seated and given menus immediately. We (three) ordered a variety of dim sum from a large menu with photos (helpful). The spring rolls came out within five minutes but were not hot. Everything else came out within 10-12 minutes and was very good. Different people came by to serve us and all asked if we needed anything else. We were happy with our meal and service and will definitely come back. The restaurant was full and busy but not loud like many similar places are.
L X.,/user_details?userid=bzO8xJzAg2kkA-w2EJHxHw,"Philadelphia, PA",12/1/2019,4,"Pretty authentic dim sum spot in the theatre district!  Great for a quick bite after the show.  Very busy at dinner time, service is fast and waiters are professional and attentive - they check in regularly, switch out  duty plates when needed. Would be happy to visit again if in the area! The dishes we tried are very good including 烧卖 皮蛋瘦肉粥，小笼包 凤爪 排骨"

Alfina W.,/user_details?userid=VyoKpE3Rvv36BxQNKofnzw,"Denver, CO",7/9/2018,4,"The Dim Sum Palace has always been among my ""must have"" stop while I am in New York City. It has varieties of menu, which includes vegetarian options which I love. Price wise, this place is slightly inflated being in the middle of Hell's Kitchen in Midtown Manhattan. Sure there are cheaper options in Chinatown, 25 or so minutes subway ride away, however, with the Happy Hours between 3-5 Monday through Friday, this place had earned my loyalty that I have to make at least one visit here whenever I am in New York."
Sunny L.,/user_details?userid=wiBJWa3RBh-Q7jM4J4dCEw,"Manhattan, NY",9/30/2018,2,"Meh. I regretted my choice of dinner immediately once I tasted their dumplings. They could do better ... much, much better in this very competitive Manhattan restaurant scene, should they want to survive."
Tasha M.,/user_details?userid=lCe7EcHq1NK8JUpr_gvq-A,"Albuquerque, NM",5/30/2018,4,I love that this place is open late even during the week. I think after hours they have a different menu but there is still plenty of choices to order. The prices are a little high but the service and the food makes up for it. We had the deep fried milk which was amazing and the juicy pork bun that came with three different sauces. The food is very authentic and I would visit again because of the service and quality of food.
Nicole P.,/user_details?userid=jU85r0PCZyZQdtms_y_1_w,"San Antonio, TX",6/25/2018,5,Everything was amazing!! Definitely worth a try!  This was on our list and we had forgotten until we walked right past it!  So glad we went in!  The Pineapple Cheese Wontons were my favorite!!!
Jayanti G.,/user_details?userid=BuzZYbq6KY7hi3V6a4dCJw,"Jersey City, NJ",2/24/2020,3,We ordered the veggie dim-sum platter which was awesome! So we just repeated that instead of ordering a main dish. We also got the veggie spring rolls which was standard stuff. Had to give the teapot a miss as it was exorbitantly priced at $8 for a teapot. Most Chinese places usually just give tea complimentary. I would not go there again. No many vegetarian options. They serve really fast so you don't get the luxury of time to savor the food even though the price is high!
Thomas L.,/user_details?userid=qA-Xkq0QysynJMGsxxdMiQ,"San Francisco, CA",11/3/2018,5,"Great late night eats in New York City . Try the green tea rice balls, shrimp dumpling and seafood dumpling"

There's some items on the menu that can be improved but if you're in the Manhattan area looking for a dim sum place you can pop in and out of this is the place. Also Prices are great as well and so is service. Been here twice in the last two years while visiting from California.
Cristina U.,/user_details?userid=YnblRFIU11eluTqouBskXw,"Shelton, CT",2/28/2020,4,Came here after a hockey game. Place was jamming but they were able to sit us. Their dim sum menu has pictures which is very helpful. Food came out fast and it was good.
Nicci N.,/user_details?userid=IkD3oNhyqaTU-ss4-7Ffcw,"Allenhurst, NJ",4/14/2019,4,"Yelp for the win again!! The food was absolutely delicious, we didn't eat one mediocre thing. I would have given 5 stars but after we were seated we had to wait 15 minutes for someone to come to just take our drink order. After the waiter came, the service definitely improved. Try the Shanghai Pork Juicy dumplings!"
Janet P.,/user_details?userid=zEBx1iUuBzhL0OOHg-a3qQ,"Falls Church, VA",9/7/2019,3,"Arrived NYC for the weekend.  Looking for Chinese food to cure the cravings.  Walked into Dim Sum Palace for a fix.  The pea shoots dumplings and the bamboo fungus dumplings were good; the Xiao Lung Bao was excellent; the Congee (Pork and thousand year old egg was so so only.   Then we ordered a Stew Duck with mushrooms, and another mushroom with tofu dish.   Both did not disappoint, but personally the dishes were over salted a bit for my taste.   They serve all kinds of tea too!  We had chrysanthemum tea - very refreshing!  They were very busy on a Sat. Night, but service was fast and accommodating, worth the 20 min wait!"
Tony W.,/user_details?userid=73_F0ROtZRTniU5o-_jXPQ,"Key Biscayne, FL",12/7/2019,4,"One of those tiny places with big taste. Fast, friendly, and fits your budget. The steamed soup-filled dumplings were excellent."

Rocky R.,/user_details?userid=kNoVHvyXHSf-vOiJdSeLqg,"Olympia, WA",12/10/2019,5,Excellent selection of Dim Sum.  Everything was delicious.  Environment is typical for the area.  Highly recommend for dim-sum.

I am in love with it, although $15 price point pinches me every time. Not a lot of other veg options, skip scallions pancake or paratha if you can, which is nothing but fried flat bread. Try their cold sake, they don't have different flavors but it's good."
Noah A.,/user_details?userid=-jg2xvARFhhfXQBEKkHNzg,"Redondo Beach, CA",3/22/2018,5,I just had delivery from dim sum palace and it was so delicious. Everything was hot and yes I'm staying at a hotel around the corner from them. Everything is delivered in individual containers and I'm very happy with my dinner. I had dim sum and it was delicious so good. I would recommend them.
AJ P.,/user_details?userid=rcomPrdPHD8PV25I-v4C7Q,"Des Plaines, IL",1/3/2020,3,"This place could have been good but the service was poor. Maybe it was because it was NYE, not sure, but the waiter just could not get our order right. I had to repeat it 3 times, and even then it wasn't right. They served us the wrong thing twice, so we asked for the correct fried rice we ordered, then still got our second order wrong. The food was okay"

Now the Dim Sum Palace may have had its day but that was some time ago. The dumplings tasted tired. They just were not happy to see me and I reciprocated the feeling; naturally! The interior was old and needed repairs, i could smell the sewer from wherever. The staff attentive but lack luster. I hope they can reclaim their title of being the Palace of Dim Sum...until them I keep searching!"

Did not like the fried spare ribs. Just gristle and bone. High on price and disappointing. Prosecco was flat although they said cane from individual bottle. Something was off with that. They brought me another exactly the same. Maybe same glass I just sent back. Didn't protest again & just took it, but other stuff real good. We did for thanksgiving"
EV W.,/user_details?userid=83_h1_f0p2RuUbj9h_fUyw,"Glendale, CA",11/9/2019,4,"Nice selection of dim sum as well as all the standard Chinese dishes one might expect.  Joint is way too small and cramped for the usual circulating carts, so instead you are given a paper menu to mark what you want.  Little to no ambiance: you're basically in a basement.  But all dim sum I tried were tasty, fresh, and hot. I'm a pescatarian, so I applaud the selection of seafood and veggie only options. There are sweet dim sum options as well, for desert. If you are a strict vegetarian or dining with one, the spicy mushroom dumplings are a solid choice.  As long as everyone in your party is ok with Chinese food in some form, there should be something here for everyone."
Sara V.,/user_details?userid=KdW9qKzbR32jkPBoH4bLnQ,"Manhattan, NY",12/27/2019,5,"When I'm craving dim sum but am not on the mood to go far out of my neighborhood, this is my favorite Hell's Kitchen option.

They're only four dumplings per order and at 5.75$, They're a little pricey, However they were delicious! They have half-price dumplings from 3 to 5 PM Monday through Friday if you can get there at that time. Anyway based on the dumplings, I would definitely go back and try again."
Kl W.,/user_details?userid=BiMQklzY2e_Xd90IN-FzHA,"Pasadena, CA",9/7/2018,5,Great authentic dim sum restaurant! They serve dim sum all day long. The food is great and the price is fair. I'd come back here again!
Hersh M.,/user_details?userid=jHY91ZxrR4sb15iUgV-B4g,"New York, NY",6/22/2018,5,I was in the area and found this spot on yelp. Was worried it would be a long wait being a friday night and so many yelp reviews so I called in but luckily they said no wait. The food here was fairly priced for the area and everything was super hot and fresh. I'm used to having dim sum where the dishes are filled with so much dough/rice/carbs but they were very generous with their protein. The only thing that was a little bland was the sticky rice but everything else was very flavorful.
Denise D.,/user_details?userid=3xn6ED8KOhT6PU-EW5x-Iw,"Miami Beach, FL",11/4/2017,5,"This is my first time in NY. So it was only logical to try out the Chinese food here. This has been such a great experience and the food here is definitely amazing. The service is fast, the food is fresh and delicious. It was so delicious that I ordered it tonight again for dinner. But this time we asked for delivery after the long day we've had walking all over NY. Servers were very prompt and professional. Definitely would recommend this Cantonese restaurant to anyone that visits NY!"

They do not taste too much with MSG. Feel very different than other Chinese dim sum. Service is perfect. It is a little pricey especially the charge of tea. Otherwise it will be perfect.

Celeste L.,/user_details?userid=8XWKXl_R1Ef-7D5WYOhjbw,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL",1/4/2021,2,"Had high expectations because of the high ratings but was disappointed. The juicy pork buns were okay.

Lauren K.,/user_details?userid=q2-QlC3HVPzRK-NiabT9dA,"Houston, TX",10/16/2019,1,"Worst dim sum I have ever had. I am so disappointed with yelp. If you never had good dim sum, maybe this place is good for you. If you had Din Tai Fung or other amazing dim sum in other places in the world, do not come here. I cannot believe people would actually say this place is good. If you think this place is good, please block me. I don't want to see your review because we do not agree on what is good and what is bad. If you are a foodie like me, don't waste your time here. I am mad at myself for wasting me time here today."
Anna N.,/user_details?userid=ukjKCU0xg3Yv16Q7ae9JoQ,"Watertown, MA",2/18/2020,5,This was such a great place. My daughter loves noodles and so we promised a noodle place. After visiting the Intrepid we found this place on the way back to Times Square. The food was fantastic. Had the lunch special. Chicken and corn soup was hot and fresh. My husband had the hot and sour soup which was really spicy. They were very flexible with the menu considering we had kids who like things a particular way. Beef and broccoli was great. Would definitely recommend if you are in the area. Service was amazing.
Yaa A.,/user_details?userid=ON74iQgO84MD0ErO0w1PjA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/30/2018,4,"They've chosen the right name. The dim sum is AMAZING, especially during their happy hour (half off dim sum!). This has to be some of my favorite dim sum in NYC period. They have a wide range of dim sum, from vegetarian, to various meat, and even sweet/desserts. I've eaten too much of it to name, but everything I've had was tasty + on their regular menu, the Mongolian lamb chops are delish (tender, juicy, perfectly sauced)! When you go, be sure to utilize the (3) sauces they put on the table. The food is good without the sauce but next level amazing with it. I highly recommend this spot if you like dim sum. Customer service is good. They also deliver, but happy hour is in the restaurant only. I love this spot!!"

The place was busy but luckily there was no wait. They make ordering easy by providing a picture of every dish with the name next to it. It took maybe 10 minutes to get our first dish after we ordered. The food was to die for. I'd recommend the pork and sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf, pork dumplings, pork sticky buns. We topped the meal off with the egg custard buns which were TO DIE FOR!!! The prices were very very reasonable for how great the food was which is a plus. We have tried dim sum from numerous places but nothing compares to the dim sum from here. We'll be back!"

The flavor is simple, it's better than any other food. Eight pieces for $11 will fill me up but not four pieces for $5.75. It's a ""healthier"" option for anything else."

Dim sum is decent, service at a Chinese restaurant always leave a bit to be wanting, but that's nothing new. It seems that there are a few dim sum dishes that aren't on the English menu, so just be aware in case you find their menu lacking. They do have the dishes, you just need to know what they are! A bit more pricey than Chinatown but to avoid the wait, it may be worth it."

Jenny L.,/user_details?userid=ry0kAvWu83fu-Ku8jcMLoQ,"San Mateo, CA",12/8/2017,4,"I had the roast pork and rice noodle rolls which were pretty good.  I always enjoy sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves and the pork option was a great choice.  I've never had a taro cilantro and pork dumpling which sounded really intriguing.  Although it was a little too new for my taste, I'm glad it was offered on the menu.  By far the standout was ha gao (shrimp dumplings) which I usually like but it was exceptionally good!  This restaurant was a lot more upscale than most dim sum places I've been to before and it's nice to have an option outside of Chinatown that's conveniently located in the city.  I hope I'll have a chance to visit again!"
Nhi N.,/user_details?userid=Q4xUoAKh8j1oIZxLiqeJMg,"Pleasanton, CA",5/30/2019,4,"Overall, there are good dim sum options which covers all your basics. The pork shu mai, scallion pancakes, and soup dumplings were pretty good. The Hong Kong style noodles were more soggy than crispy. The prices are a little steep for dim sum. The service is good."

Joma W.,/user_details?userid=a3QiEQ2b7d4-IkdHmrQnWw,"Olney, MD",8/14/2019,4,"One of the best dimsum in Times Square and they are open until midnight. We came on a Saturday with 7 people. We got seated right away, it wasn't busy. The waiter gave us the dimsum menu and just the regular menu. We ordered most on the dimsum menu and added Peking duck, roasted duck, Mongolian beef and fried rice. The dimsum came first and everything were fresh. And it was delicious! But the Peking duck was so salty that we didn't finished eating the remaining duck. The Mongolian beef and fried rice was ok, I think they can do better. If we only ordered the dimsum I could rate this five. I will still go back but for sure only for dimsum. And the location is great just few blocks away from times square."

Cate G.,/user_details?userid=XessgbAN5ttogqACJ4ZgOw,"San Antonio, TX",11/3/2019,5,Absolutely Loved this restaurant! The best Chinese food I've ever had! The general Tso's chicken was out of this world. There wasn't that much batter so it was very enjoyable to eat a bigger piece of chicken breast! The Dumplings were tasty and delicious.

Thomas W.,/user_details?userid=jOU73K85NeMzBsqwJtfu0A,"New York, NY",3/25/2017,3,"It's not Chinatown, or the high end of dim sum.  It does however fill a void in the Times Square area for something different.  If you travel to London's West End you would think that you are in Asia where street food is King!  I am hoping that the tiny restaurant gems on 9th Avenue will eventually take over the Great White Way.  At Dim Sum Palace the har gal's, and shui mai's are outstanding.  I could leave the bars, and the pan fried noodles.  The fish congee is quite a bargain, and I here that some of the other dishes are worth the premium one pays outside of Chinatown.  The sticky rice was also a real treat.  Is this the coming of street food on Broadway?  Perhaps not, but I think most dim sum fans will not be disappointed!"

All the staples like shrimp dumplings and siu mai are here. No dan ta or cheong fun, though, among a couple other conspicuous absences that bring this all down a notch.

Ilwoo H.,/user_details?userid=1xZDeCio4x3917dv1sX4sg,"Los Angeles, CA",4/11/2019,2,"I would give this place 2.5star if I could. I've been this place few times since 2017 and I have no idea why I kept going back to this place for eat. Maybe I didn't find any better dim sum restaurant in the area yet. This place dim sum was ok but honestly not the best. I've been had eat better dim sum elsewhere but it's good place to try when you in the time square area. To be honest with you, in my opinion if you're Queens or New Jersey, drive through at this restaurant, it's waste place for try. My favorite dim sum is soup dumplings and shrimp dumplings and egg custard buns. It hard to get egg custard buns at any of dim sum restaurant. you can see that menu only few restaurants. Maybe egg custard buns made me kept going back to this place for eat that. I ordered crab meat soup dumplings, shrimp dumpling, bbq buns, egg custard buns, spicy cucumber. If you like sweets and never try egg custard bun yet then you should give a try when you are in the area. Egg custard buns were good then Dim sum restaurant in Queens but not the best. Delivery was quickly and faster than estimated time. I thought my friend food came first but my food was came faster than my friend food. When I ordered by seamless they said it took time almost hour but it arrived 40mins later. It packed very well but crab meat soup dumplings wasn't hot enough or warm enough, it was almost barely warm."

Grace W.,/user_details?userid=-gCbrwbpIn3jTEsAbtIFBQ,"Kirkland, WA",10/22/2017,3,"The dim sum here was okay.  It was tasty but kind of mediocre compared to the dim sum you can get in LA or in Seattle.  The portion size was decent.  During happy hour, their dim sum is half off.  That was a nice bonus.  I think the best thing here was their fried taro.  I thought that was a pretty unique item that I've never had at dim sum before.  The waiters/waitresses were nice and attentive.  Their facilities were also pretty clean.  It is located near hell's kitchen so it is a pretty easy walk from Time's Square."

I ordered two soup dumplings: pork and crabmeat. To be honest, I can't tell if there was any crabmeat in the dumplings. They either mixed the crabs very well with ground pork or I received the wrong order. However, there're differences in seasoning between the two. One is a bit salty (I'm guessing this is the pork one) and the other has a hint of sweetness. The skin is too thick for my liking and I feel like there isn't enough soup in the dumplings. The service, on the other hand, is great. My server was attentive and nice."

Stanley K.,/user_details?userid=WC4htBtZcGhiSmQy68aMrg,"Manhattan, NY",5/8/2017,1,"What an experience, we came here to have a quick dinner before the show and got sat immediately.  We decided not to order from the dim sum menu since we saw that they have happy hour from 3-6 with 50% off from Yelp, so we ordered from the regular menu.  We placed our order in Cantonese to the server that we wanted stir fry noodle with beef and crispy garlic chicken, which he recommended.  To our surprise, he brought out the pan fried noodle with beef.  Which we thought we might have mistakenly picked.  No problem, we started eating until we realized that some of the beef were not fully cooked.  Not fully cooked beef can be a big issue in Chinese restaurant, because they could be frozen meats that are not fresh. Thus, we told the server.  He took the dish back.  Then, he proceeded to bring a chicken dish and asked if we wanted to give it a try. We asked why, he said that they are having computer issue and the kitchen is making the wrong order.  We were so confused as to why we would have to eat something we didn't order, but since we were in a hurry for the show, we finally let it go.   They eventually brought a new plate of 'stir-fry noodle with beef' to replace with the old one we got.  That dish was nothing I have ever had, it was so bland that I felt like I was just chewing nothing.  The chicken that we didn't order had more flavor, but it was sour which seems to be coming from the sauce.  Can't tell if it was bad or what.  We ended up with the check that they charged us for the chicken dish we ordered, which was more expensive than the wrong chicken dish they brought up.  I wish we had more time to enjoy the dinner, in that case, we would definitely request them to make the chicken that we actually ordered and paid for.  Let's say that this is worse than some of the authentic Chinese restaurants in Chinatown and the service was terrible.  WOULD NEVER RETURN!"

Zoe B.,/user_details?userid=lyGhjvqRkqW5xSKutHrgSA,"Buffalo, NY",2/24/2018,4,"Very cozy place for late night dinner/snack,liked the fried milk, chicken feet and pork ribs! Also hometown fried noodles tastes good!"
Jaynie H.,/user_details?userid=1RndgJt0a3PFLK0KMZGwDA,"Millersburg, OH",2/22/2018,5,"Amazing! This place is quite literally a little hole in the wall but most definitely a hidden treasure. A nice, clean place to sit down and an easy walk from times square. It's pricier than I expected but that's just city eating. The pan fried tiny buns changed my life and the service was very attentive. I would definitely recommend."
Jamie W.,/user_details?userid=9G9p7Xn4EyhShzQCQAGa_w,"Brentwood, TN",6/7/2019,3,"[Updated: Dim Sum reached out to me right away after this review. Apologized and asked for ticket number to address with delivery person. I modified my review because their customer service was great. The delivery service was rude.] Unfortunately I ordered food and picked the wrong location through grub hub app. My mistake, I get it. The delivery guy kept calling and I couldn't understand him at all. I kept providing him the address, hoping that's what he asking for because- you know - language barrier. Then someone else called me. Explained that the address was 49th street rather than 40th street. I apologized, gave the appropriate address and told him that we would be waiting in the lobby. I already paid and tipped. The driver called multiple times. I texted him the google drop address because, again, language barrier. He arrived, my daughter grabbed the food, apologized and thanked him... then he called her an f'n b*tch as he walked out the door. Wow. She's 16. I get that there was an issue with the address. Stuff happens. He could be mad the whole way there and the whole way back... but that was a bit ridiculous. The food was good....though tainted by the experience."
Karen C.,/user_details?userid=D5SbZV_nHBqkoTj7pP0H0A,"Orlando, FL",10/29/2017,4,Stopped into Dim sum palace.  I was say right away.  I ordered the seafood shu Mai and Shanghai soup dumplings.  The food came out quick. The Shanghai dumplings tasted good and so did the seafood shu mai. The pork buns were over priced but tasted good.
Cathy N.,/user_details?userid=bmOU_wefEVthvqa3BA5dDQ,"Ann Arbor, MI",12/15/2019,4,Everything tasted delicious! Their chili oil is very spicy and has great flavor - which I loved. The shrimp dumplings were my favorite.
Jeannine M.,/user_details?userid=OBxepfAxpUHL5C13s7c7gg,"Bayside, NY",8/6/2017,4,The food was delicious. There is a large selection. The tea was very good. The service was OK.  The prices are fair.
Jen A.,/user_details?userid=Wnk42bQzzE7d3vgz_ZEKhQ,"Springfield, PA",10/26/2019,4,Amazing homemade soy sauce & other condiments. Place is small & busy as are most good spots are.

Aaron L.,/user_details?userid=TtyGLjcFdPoDnRc32pV_hw,"Los Angeles, CA",8/4/2019,2,"Nothing terribly wrong with this place except for the fact that the dim sum is simply not good. I've ordered the basics before (e.g. chow fun) and that was fine, but I would steer clear if you're desiring anything close to authentic. Cleary a tourist trap..."
Mikel T.,/user_details?userid=OrxVh9ccfUJWGXbjsb_Lsg,"Tacoma, WA",6/29/2019,5,"We came here before a matinee show and stoked that we did. I can't say enough good things about this place, you can always tell how a place is gonna be by checking out the patrons that dine there. This place was bumpin and the food was incredible and the prices were spot on. We ordered 8 orders of dim sum and each one better than the last. The garlic pork ribs and scallion pancake were the fav but the shumai and pork bun were second in line. Great service, lively atmosphere and doesn't break the bank."

Sara M.,/user_details?userid=3bVmUDqGx6-IkEWNRJKBVQ,"Dallas, TX",10/20/2019,3,"Was disappointed in this place - food and service were both hit and miss. Did have the Hong Kong cocktail which was very yum! We ordered shrimp dumpling, roast pork dumpling, steamed spare rib with olive and fries spare rib. The steam spare rib were really gristly but the flavor was great. The fried spare rib were dry and gristly. The duck dumpling were lacking in flavor. Instead of shrimp dumpling they brought out chicken. We let a server know who whisked then away but then nothing. After about 15 minutes I inquired about the shrimp dumplings as they still hadn't been brought out. Another 5 minutes and they arrived - no apology about the mix up. But when they brought the bill a few minutes later all of sudden people were gushing over us!"

Jorge G.,/user_details?userid=7WNfrHiBjhdgBp_CyCPXGw,"New Hope, PA",7/5/2019,4,First time didn't understand how to order. You get a framed menu and mark items. With waitress assistance ordered some spring rolls and fried dumplings. Omg they were so good. Had orange chicken and hubby moo shou pork with a share of pork fried rice all delicious. Definitely coming back to try other items. Good service and clean bathrooms.

Erin H.,/user_details?userid=Lzdb2QUgTrJ7LfWVxSoJaA,"Orlando, FL",9/19/2017,4,"Happy hour here is on point! We stopped in just in time to enjoy a ton of delicious dim sum at half off prices (3-5 pm). Our faves included the mushroom dumplings, chive buns, and green tea rice balls (a pleasant sweet surprise). The cucumber salad is refreshing but super spicy - tread carefully with that one. The soup dumplings are just ok, but for the price, they were worth trying. Service was great and efficient. A great spot to check out after a theatre matinee or for a late lunch or snack."

We came at 10:45 pm after the Lakers vs Knicks game (Lakers won btw); their dim sum still tasted really good and fresh! Bravo!!!"
Brian B.,/user_details?userid=qtWYsp3Fagzr-yWtJvO8JQ,"Chicago, IL",5/15/2017,4,"Stopped in here for a quick bite and was not overly hungry. So had some cold sesame noodles which were kinda tough but also had a dim sum platter which was about 8 different dumplings served in a steam basket. They were all real good and I really liked the three ,little sauces you get with them. Huge menu here and would like to go back and try more. Good service also."
Thao N.,/user_details?userid=vQK8ffoiyP8SMpVY2NA4GQ,"Trinity, FL",8/19/2020,4,The food came out really quick and it was good for the most part. But I was disappointed because it came out room temperature and not hot.
Megan W.,/user_details?userid=GaRGFNAOhgHP66znd1eMkw,"Hattiesburg, MS",3/10/2019,3,"We found this place while exploring the city. We were seated right away. With in minutes we order drinks. I ordered the Dim Sum Platter and Shanghai juicy pork buns. My friend ordered the pork buns too. The first order of buns cake out in 15 mins. They were yummy but then the wait began. We waited and waited. Saw people who arrived later getting their food. We ask the waiter twice and finally about 45 min later the other buns came and then later the plaster I order. The was no acknowledgement by the staff that our order had been forgotten. loved the buns. It was fresh and juicy. The platter, well I ate half. I wouldnt order it again"

Deana C.,/user_details?userid=AyNEHer0B_0wBPs3LYyAaQ,"Staten Island, NY",6/19/2019,5,I placed a large order online for a group of 10.  Usually ordering for a group makes me nervous but the process was incredibly easy especially when you have the option to label who each order is for.  I requested that the food be delivered at 12 and received a call at 11:59 that it was here.  Very impressive and appreciated.  Everyone's meal was individually bagged with their name on it making them quick and easy to distribute.  Now to the food... excellent.  Do you know how difficult it is to have a unanimous vote?! The shredded duck spring rolls are to die for.  I reluctantly shared them with my coworkers after they saw how much I was enjoying them.  Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and perfect.
Jamie B.,/user_details?userid=EuVsZt4EuWfSMM1KlToqPg,"Saint Louis, MO",8/15/2019,4,"I love Dim Sum and try various places anytime I travel.  The Crispy Garlic Spare Ribs were amazing!  Shrimp roll, Chicken Shu Mai, and various Pork Dumplings were also very good.  The dipping sauces were a perfect compliment.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars: I had floaters in my cocktail, my husband did not receive the hot & sour soup he ordered (we were full and did not need it anyway), and the paper napkin was stuck to his plate.  The wait staff was great, though, and I would not hesitate to return.  Thank you for a great brunch!"
Jessica W.,/user_details?userid=RQhAok-F4jGkBzC4ZTxNgw,"New York, NY",9/28/2019,1,"I order the half perking duck and all I get is the skin with no meat and the bone. I called the restaurant to complaint and they said this is how they are and this is how it should be. The person who pick up the phone is rude and refused to look into the issue and always want to argue. She asked me if I ever had perking duck before and that's how the duck look like. I told her I am a regular customer at this place and she look up my phone number and she said "" this is your first order, this is what perking duck look like"". Stay away from this place at all cost"

The juicy pork buns were juicy but the wrapping was very thick. The coconut cake never made it out (not sure why since it's a cold dessert that's typically made ahead of time). It wasn't busy and the staff was nice."

Jiinjju K.,/user_details?userid=BpVMlJ4-tDO3hphF3Ah_yA,"Suwanee, GA",2/28/2019,5,"The Peking duck (we had half) was amazing !! I strongly recommend this for everyone. I never really liked duck because I never had any where that was good but this place have the best duck! Crispy skin on the outside and juicy/ tender meat inside. It was the best duck I've ever had! They cut the duck in front of you and make 5 duck buns and rest on plate. It was truly one of the best experiences. The restaurant was smaller than I thought it was. And they have HAPPY HOURS 3-5 ALL DIM SUMS ARE 50% OFF!! The juicy pork dim sum was my favorite the broth/juice inside was really good but it was bit dry on the outside it made it seem ""old"" and the shrimp dim sum was okay when it came out it was hard for me to pick it up because it was too sticky it was like melting. Lastly the pork bbq buns were better than I thought it would be! It's sweet mildly flavorful pulled pork in the inside. Overall it was an amazing dim sum experience :)"

There are definitely some dim sum favorites that I cannot find here. But, I'd rather not have them than be disappointed by the quality."

We went during the happy hour so it was half price. We also got beef chow fun which was good as well but the real treat was the dim sum. Great atmosphere and friendly wait staff.

The food is so amazing and don't even get us started on the chili oil. We have a place back in anahiem but this place knocks that out of the park. Would definitely recommend to everyone. Such nice servers too. Coming back tomorrow lol!!
Jeff B.,/user_details?userid=3laEhNvTjdNUb36ICpO3wA,"Saint Louis, MO",8/15/2019,4,"Very good dim sum.  Friendly & attentive staff.  They did miss something I ordered, but it was not on our bill, so no harm no foul, and I was plenty full."
Phillip P.,/user_details?userid=SNmPfKNQHcMLa0i_GdaN4Q,"Tempe, AZ",9/30/2019,5,Great dim sum. Friendly staff. Great service. Walking distance from Time Square. An excellent option for Time Square area.
Luis L.,/user_details?userid=HMkSnkY_CKjBfOQn8o1anQ,"Los Angeles, CA",5/22/2019,3,"The dim sum was quite mediocre in my humble opinion, or maybe just not my style. Service was quite good though, responsive and fast."
Josie T.,/user_details?userid=5rZA5h2d4EqeDKMC_qMXdw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/6/2016,5,Passed by and it said Grand Opening all day dimsum. Decided to give it a try. Their food was yummy. Had their steam pork buns and it was better than some restaurants in chinatown. Also tried their stir fry beef cubes with veggies. Wasn't too heavy. Perfect with a bowl of white rice. Would definitely come back to eat again.
Ava H.,/user_details?userid=qJiMGPhzYj7unsqaTJErxQ,"Tappan, NY",9/26/2019,5,"Me and my family found a new spot for great food in New York City. Dim Sum Palace takes simple comfort food to a whole new level.  My family ordered shu mai, soup dumplings, sesame noodles, chicken lo main, and the scallion pancakes. Lo main, was very good. The shu mai was different than any other one I have had, it was very very good! However the soup dumplings, sesame noodles, and scallion pancakes were the best I have ever had!! The food came out extremely quick! My one complaint is that  we were waiting on our shu mai for some time. It took us a while to get our waiters attention so we could ask for the shu mai again, because he was not paying attention to us. Eventually we got the shu mai. The food was so good though, that it didn't matter! I would definitely recommend this place to others and come back here again!"
MC S.,/user_details?userid=ehC612qQFMoNDbg57uXFiA,"Fort Collins, CO",9/25/2019,5,Yummy! If you like dim sum and are in the area do a favor yourself and try this place. Dishes were so flavorful and yummy! I want to go back

The Garlic Spare Ribs were tasty but contained more fat than meat. Chicken Low Mein was average at best. Shrimp dumplings not so much. Has a cocktail that was too sweet & tasted like cough syrup. Service just okay.

Anna N.,/user_details?userid=Qqwa4iHQX-OZfKy4S8R-aA,"Manhattan, NY",11/6/2016,4,"Good dim sum without going to China town. I enjoyed the shrimp and duck dumplings. The soup dumplings aren't as juicy as other places, but still good. The menu here is more limited but gets the job done. They don't offer rice noodle rolls. You order off a paper menu instead of the rolling cart. Small but clean inside. Good service. I come because of the happy hour between 3-6 pm. 1/2 off!  No other dim sum options in this area, so I'm happy it's here. Don't expect a big dim sum place, but a place that can satisfy your cravings in the meantime."
Claire L.,/user_details?userid=YyGcMYJhBRqkWz19PkDRaA,"Manhattan, NY",12/5/2016,4,Go during the happy hour - their dimsum is half off! I was a little bit disappointed on their honey walnut shrimp dish since the mayo was a little too heavy but nonetheless dimsum was great!! Service is nice as well.

If anything, this place is honestly more like 2.5 stars because it took forever and a day for us to get our bill, and when longer for them to return with our card. I'll round up since it's one of the few dim sum places in the area and food was decent. Definitely nothing to rave home about though."
Wilson Z.,/user_details?userid=RNnwbzQESgtKI1blt_7gGQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/12/2019,5,"I went here the other day with my friends to try out their food and it was absolutely delicious!

The atmosphere was good and their service was quick, the servers were friendly and recommended us these delicious foods to try. I will be coming back for sure!"

Stumbled by luck onto this little gem of Chinese and dim sum spot that actually makes them fresh to order. The food was fresh and super tasty, the service was impeccable from start to finish. Nothing better than this to end our New York City visit. We had the crispy beef, the sweet and sour crispy fish, and a chicken with mixed vegetables in brown sauce and our host was kind enough to add black fungi mushroom upon my request since I love it so much. The dim sum were all excellent. I knew it was a more authentic spot the minute I saw the bamboo steam dim sum baskets coming out compared to the metal ones most dim sum places now use. We had the (shrimp, seafood, and duck) and they were all so yummy. Whomever reads this,  you should definitely try them out. We'll be back for sure. Kevin helped us and made our experience memorable. Thank you so much for the amazing food."

We had 4 hours to go kill before check in time, we decided to order dim sum and have it delivered to the hotel lobby while we wait. Food arrived promptly, delivery driver read the notes we left on how to meet us since the lobby was packed. Food was on time and amazing. We had siu mai, egg yolk bun, har gow, and congee. Congee was more on the bland side which is better than salty. Siu Mai and har gow was on point and def recommended, better any I've had in LA or OC. All in all a place I definitely recommend especially with the free delivery charge."

Nancy B.,/user_details?userid=wigjuj9W99NtorAJnPRrOw,"Alhambra, CA",5/31/2019,1,This review is not for the food. The food was good. This is review is because the establishment up-charged me on what total I signed off on the receipt. Adding an amount that a person did not sign off on is fraud. Good thing I keep my receipts. Sending it to claims. Goodluck proving that one. Am almost certain that this was done by the manager/owner. If you come here make sure to double check your bank statement and keep the receipt.
Sophia B.,/user_details?userid=hlb7l_e1Z78I9h0zsknuaA,"Alphabet City, Manhattan, NY",6/9/2018,4,"WOW my LA heart is so happy. Now I fully believe LA has the best Chinatown and I'll stand by that. BUT this was some of the best dim sum I've had in New York yet! It was so fun to come and share a bunch of plates with friends and try out some fantastic dumplings. This is a VERY busy place (which is a sign of how good it is), so you'll want to be efficient with your ordering, and you might need to flag down your server to get your attention (honestly, I prefer that though. I'd rather be left alone to enjoy my meal). I wouldn't say this is a particularly fancy place, but it's very clean, very nice, and a wonderful spot to catch dinner before a show."

Both occasions were good, not transcendent Chinese food, but quality, comforting and as expected dishes that we all know and like. I've had the dim sums (great, esp. the soup dumplings and the shumais), the chicken pao (tender and spicy), the garlic eggplant (melt in your mouth delicious), the Chinese broccoli (not interesting, under-cooked and were served mostly on the stems, not the florets), scallion pancakes (first time they were delicious, they arrived a bit too greasy when I ordered via the Yelp app), and finally the pork fried rice (decent fried rice, a bit dry but overall flavorful). Good neighborhood joint in a busy area."

I have eaten at a lot of dim sum places, but it terms of taste and quality, this place stands out above the others. I highly recommend this place if the higher prices isn't a problem. I usually associate dim sum as a kind of Asian brunch. But this transcends brunch. This is worthy of evening dining and savoring with a nice wine."

When we arrived in NYC and had an urge to have a dim sum fix the next morning, we found it near our hotel. The dishes are small comparing to the west coast and more importantly, not as fresh and are overcooked. They are sloppy overall and are also a bit pricy given the quality, presentation and the atmosphere -- I understand the concept of a location premium and tourist trap but felt that they took it a bit too far."

I was a little shocked because while the dim sum is good, it was $22 for my bill for one. If I had come not during happy hour it would have been $44 and I felt like that's a bit too pricey for dim sum. However, it is located in Midtown where the rents are higher than Chinatown (I presume) so factoring in the cost, maybe it's not too bad. I probably wouldn't come here again and would just go to Chinatown for dim sum instead."

Van D.,/user_details?userid=Wzr4cwBgfcMGaEevJHJDPw,"Newport Beach, CA",5/23/2019,5,Fresh and hot! People are friendly and food is so good. I wish there was a place like this in California.
Eric W.,/user_details?userid=ANRMJGXR-lq5mV_41S4y4g,"Cranford, NJ",12/16/2018,4,Wow a place on Restaurant Row that's good and doesn't try to rip you off.  Me and two buddies stopped for a few drinks on a Friday and wound up here.  Food was definitely above average and we devoured everything. We'll definitely be back
Simon P.,/user_details?userid=xEBSb1m6skrhoiXuf59D8Q,"Warsaw, Poland",8/22/2018,5,"Long story short: best dim sums in Midtown! And don't get discouraged because it's in touristy Restaurants Row not Flushing, Queens. All kinds of Chinese dumplings fresh, hot and tasty. The service is fast and the prices are much lower you'd suspect."
Jiancong W.,/user_details?userid=oFpiFyEuLfHHQeE1D1PDwg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/6/2019,5,"I haven't had dimsum in a while, so I decided to bring my family with me to try out Dim Sum Palace after reading some of the reviews. I'm so glad I found this place because their dimsum is high quality and delicious! I asked for a few recommendations and they suggested the shrimp dumpling and shumai, they were both really fresh and tasty! We also tried one of their noodle dishes and it was amazing!! We ended the meal with egg yolk creamy buns and they are probably the best buns I ever tried. I will definitely be back for more!!!"

Anonymous R.,/user_details?userid=V_9cnxGaZccmAfDVah9M2Q,"Bergenfield, NJ",11/2/2018,3,"Slightly disappointed by this place, I came here after seeing the great reviews. The first thing we noticed was there was no A/C and the restaurant was very warm. We got a bunch of dim sum plates, the soup dumplings had a thick skin, was expecting them to have a thin skin. The crab soup dumplings were better than the chicken ones which tasted bland, frozen and had little soup, both were ok. The dim sum overall was mediocre, the best part was the pan fried noodles with chicken. The staff was attentive and came by often to remove empty plates and refilled our water glasses.   Recommend the main dishes than the dim sum here."
Smita N.,/user_details?userid=zRuA5xWmGz7jQPo-D6yktg,"Fremont, CA",3/20/2019,5,"Excellent place for dimsum near times square. There were sooo many options for vege dumplings, and all were good with the spicy sauces. We were there on a 4 day trip and had my forst and last meal here , it was just what i wanted , warm dumplings and vege fried rice , yummmmiest ever!!!"
Martin M.,/user_details?userid=fQDS9Q2kTEGMp9oNgFT5pQ,"Centerra, Goodyear, AZ",6/28/2019,5,My second time here the food is great. I would recommend this place is anyone that is looking for good dumplings or fried rice
Donna F.,/user_details?userid=_ayMcPHQN_3BhJtzBsj1tQ,"Leesburg, VA",11/18/2018,3,"Thought the food was over-condimented, if that's even a word. Too salty, too sweet and unfortunately that killed the natural deliciousness of the dishes."
Shan J.,/user_details?userid=jzZY9AOkpVt8qhx1qkI5zA,"Arcadia, CA",10/20/2018,3,It's nice to have authentic Chinese food after late night broadway shows. The place is a little bit small. The price is relatively expensive but totally understandable given the neighborhood. There's no major complaint. But it doesn't justify to give more than 3 stars.

Laura B.,/user_details?userid=iBWdEgj_FqdBB9tU_xlaJw,"San Rafael, CA",10/9/2016,5,"We stopped in after a long day of walking around the city. The atmosphere was clean, professional, and accommodating. We ordered 6 items and the three of us were stuffed. Our favorites were the vegetable spring rolls, pork buns, and General Tso's sesame chicken. The food was steaming hot and very fresh. The service was incredible.  This place is def on the list of places to visit every time I visit the kids in NY."
Alberto G.,/user_details?userid=ZIjZeQ4BARkUIOhQa8patA,"Peekskill, NY",12/10/2016,5,"Unbelievably excellent. Shocked to see it was not a touristy place. Amazing food, expertly prepared in house.

Kalani B.,/user_details?userid=5TgmnmzoYDbnAEpNPqhUBg,"Campbell, CA",4/25/2018,5,"IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE MORE STARS I WOULD. What a great experience here that we came two days in a row for happy hour. Best soup dumplings. Highly, highly recommend."
Tara P.,/user_details?userid=1vdHo0xGa-UQC860lGj6Zg,"Caledonia, NY",10/23/2018,5,"I walked in at 4:50pm on a Tuesday and found out that their 1/2 price dim sum Happy Hour ended at 5:00.  SCORE!  I quickly ordered a dim sum sampler, shrimp dumplings and spicy cucumbers.  I only really ordered the cucumbers so that I'd have a vegetable, but they ended up being my favorite part of the meal!  They were AWESOME! Even with an $8 glass of wine, my bill was still just $21."
Zhengnan X.,/user_details?userid=1uByjmsXyPxUMMKI-BJyfQ,"Arlington, VA",5/14/2017,5,This might be the best Hongkong dim sum I had in the States. Worth a visit and revisit!! Love the dumplings!!! Shrimp dumplings and coconut cakes are my favorite!!!
Duane D.,/user_details?userid=tbmA9Uyw1GgMKA6vLhk8Yg,"Virginia Beach, VA",12/21/2017,4,"All That and Dim Sum! Yep, if you're in Times Square and are looking for a home in the wall restaurant with quality dim sum then this is your spot. The shrimp dumplings are extra meaty. The highlight of the night for me was their Pork Soup Dumplings! They take a little while longer to prepare since their injecting hot soup in to the dumpling package and i strongly recommend waiting a few minutes before devouring these bundles of porky deliciousness. The burst of soup melding with the meat makes for a flavorful savory bite that makes you glad they come in 6 pieces. The Sesame Mochi Ball dessert dim sum is also a nice sweet ending to the meal that's crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The Fried Garlic Ribs are little meaty nuggets of goodness although be aware they do have small bones attached to some pieces. All for very affordable prices ranging from $5-$9 a plate.  Great variety on the dim sum and they also offer traditional plated entree options as well."
Laura H.,/user_details?userid=Lpt16J5AGVU5WeisAaov2Q,"Cleveland, TN",4/21/2019,3,Went here due to 4 star average reviews. I suspect it is for the dumplings. As I walked through I noticed everyone had them but ordered chicken with broccoli. It was not great and wouldn't come back. My husband got dumplings and he really like them.
Brian C.,/user_details?userid=zmqj2DvCK1RZuVfnnJkGQg,"Bow, NH",2/3/2019,5,Some of the best dim sum I ever had. Everything is amazingly fresh.  The shrimp dim sum in particular was really good.  And the Kung Po chicken was amazingly flavorful and packed a bit of a kick.  Also the sweet and sour chicken is highly recommended

Conveniently located block from Time Square, this small establishment looks shady from the outside, but quite trendy on the inside. The employees were friendly and the menu was extensive. It's not the traditional Dim Sum with the cart, but everything we ordered was delicious. Bathrooms are clean too."
Heidi L.,/user_details?userid=xhWY68xn9nPt1g6Nh46seg,"New York, NY",11/14/2016,4,Cooked-to-order dim sum served all day in Manhattan's theater district that rivals the best dim sum houses in Chinatown.  Three of us ordered ten dim sum dishes and one dessert to share at happy hour and we were very full at the end of the meal.  Everything we tried was very good except the Whole Young Coconut Pudding which was not served in a coconut as advertised but in a very small round plastic container.  It tasted good but not having the coconut (I eat the coconut meat) the presentation was a big disappointment.  The meal was a great bargain at 50 percent off during happy hours.  Service was friendly and attentive.  We'll go back for dim sum again or try their dinner entrees.
Caroline W.,/user_details?userid=1uc2ApIqgs7m1BaaDh5n7A,"New York, NY",6/2/2019,5,I recommend Dim Sum Palace to my clients from Florida. They love the food there and extend a very warm thank you to me. They say that it was exceptional and highly recommended.
Meng Y.,/user_details?userid=DChCO8AwfWlAftszC5aCdA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/2/2019,5,We came here with my families.  We ordered some classical dim sum dishes.  Their service is not perfect.  We had one dumpling (3pcs) before we ate last one the waiter already took the plate away.  So we complained and they offer another complete new dish for us.

The menu is very simple and the interior is very ambient! We ordered A LOT of dim sum which we shared between the two of us. Everything came nice and hot. Totally worth going to!!
Dan A.,/user_details?userid=HTrJ2CnnXZ0NueT78B0RGw,"San Francisco, CA",11/3/2018,4,This is a great dim sum restaurant open super late - close to the theatres and Hell's Kitchen. I like how they give you minced ginger as a side.

Aoshi L.,/user_details?userid=dfDDYL2Qb3V4VQg1QylfYw,"Jersey City, NJ",9/15/2018,3,"Ordered six dishes, none of them is spectacular.  Among them, the shrimp dumpling is probably the best. There is one whole shrimp inside it, and the flavor is also pretty nice. But I would not recommend pork ribs, ducks, and others. Not that they are bad, but just not very good."
Drew C.,/user_details?userid=2srM-HKQB6AdWPh15OnXnA,"Fort Worth, TX",7/29/2018,5,Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes! Wowzers. This is good Dim Sum. Was super busy however service was excellent. Very reasonable prices. Clean on the inside. Will certainly go back!
Marc X.,/user_details?userid=-2gXKLkkmzv-D8pkC12dFw,"North Tonawanda, NY",8/23/2019,5,"Normally when in NYC I make a trip to Chinatown for Dim Sum, timing did not permit so I read some reviews and took a chance on Dim Sum Palace on W. 46th Street (They have 2 other locations). Service was great from the moment we walked in the door. You order Dim Sum off a menu with photos and it had a decent selection, enough for me to leave well sated. Har Gow were delicious as were the fried pork and leek dumplings, sticky rice was a standout as well. What I thought was a typo, Spare Ribs in Olive sauce turned out to be delicious take on spare ribs in black bean sauce. I will definitely return."
Michelle M.,/user_details?userid=ODOlwf8G1Bs-qvZIiOlXlg,"Indian Rocks Beach, FL",1/3/2017,5,"Excellent food. Service is quick and professional.  Nice atmosphere. Best dimsum is the barbecue pork.

Nancy H.,/user_details?userid=-5pgXEVT4ByYLmKu5bWJ_w,"Boston, MA",8/10/2016,3,At this place now. Food is just okey. Be careful if you order food based on the pix you see on the menu bc they can be very different when you get them. That's my main complaint. I ordered the mushroom dumplings but they came out n I had no idea they were the mushroom dumplings. They were in different shapes than what's being presented in the menu. And they were also made with different type of skins / wraps than what I observed from the menu.   Nothing bad but just different than what's presented on the menu. Felt a little bit misled by them.

We were dining with a 1 year old so it's a bit challenging to dine, but everyone made sure that we were comfortable. Food were great and the staff were excellent! Will definitely go back here."

It was pretty crowded when we go there (12:30 on Sunday) but we were able to snag a table within 10 minutes since there were only 2 of us. We got 5 dishes and they were all wonderful, I especially loved the chicken shumai, it was just so flavorful. I also really enjoyed the juicy chicken buns, which are incredibly hard to come by and were so mouth watering and delicious. Dim Sum Palace will definitely be in our NY restaurant rotation."

Sue D.,/user_details?userid=7YG8kwyK-XBFfiVs3a11gQ,"New York, NY",11/4/2018,3,Quick dim sum bite pre-theater. Started off well.  The shrimp har gow was very good. Shrimp were fresh and cooked perfectly. Pea shoots seafood dumpling was also excellent. Chicken soup dumplings were too doughy and not delicate. The egg custard bun was terrible--the custard was runny and grainy and the bun was chewy and doughy. We did not finish them and they are my favorite. I prefer dim sum in Chinatown. I would come here again for the first 2 dishes and try something else.

Ray G.,/user_details?userid=iHKEEixni_PGUKEqDczTPA,"Dayton, VA",12/23/2018,4,Great food.  Service was friendly.  Food came out fresh and hot.  Dumplings were great.  Small place but gives it a neighborhood restaurant feel.  Worth the stop.  Affordable for NY.
Tan S.,/user_details?userid=4S3_Oi2wENTqNaBaOZ17HQ,"New York, NY",9/22/2016,5,"Very fresh dim sum, the place is clean and the service is friendly!! Ha gao is my favorite. Best Dim Sum in Hell's Kitchen"
Jonathan G.,/user_details?userid=UWRd6CDzHWOpy3jNPDNxoQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/27/2019,4,"Tried the dim sum tasty menu, which was a 12 pc dumpling sampler.  It was great.  Also had the Sichuan spicy beef stew...  wasn't a fan of it.  All in all it was a good restaurant and would check this out if you need some dim sum!"

Colette R.,/user_details?userid=HX56jyDY5s5RoHv4bzahaA,"Parker, CO",12/9/2018,5,My favorite place in New York so far. They also run a happy hour where everything is 1/2 price. Everything was made to order and extremely fresh and had great flavor.
Melissa H.,/user_details?userid=QnECHLGIJdexdvr46CsHXA,"Fairfield, CT",12/21/2019,5,Found this place super late one night looking for a quick takeout to drive home from NYC. Ordered spring rolls and they we so yummy we decided to go back next trip in to NYC to dine in. We have dined in 2 additional times since then and it is so good. Great dim sum. Soup dumplings are good and their main dinner dishes are good too. Fried rice with shrimp and pineapple tasty as well as their sautéed string beans. Good service and cozy.

My boyfriend and I ate the same things, BBQ pork buns, chicken soup dumpling and the sesame chicken. I'm thinking I got a bad piece of chicken. It ruined our trip to NYC as I'm still not feeling 100% even two days later. Please choose another place to eat!"

Wonderful flavor and perfectly steamed. We sampled several shrimp pieces that were fresh and yummy. The spring rolls were a nice compliment. Veggie fried rice was quite good, not esp greasy and nicely seasoned. Plenty to eat, reasonably priced. Fun to try something new and like it!"

The staff was NOT gracious and accomodating, but rather rude and inattentive.  While trying to get the attention of a wait staff person (unsucessfully), I watched the manager massage one of the waitresses neck and shoulders at the bar, while two more employees hung out and told jokes at the bar (probably about the patrons!) And as for the food, as the couple from San Francisco sitting next to me said, ""this could be the worst Chinese food I've ever eaten."" Crystal shrimp dumplings had large pieces of shell in with the shrimp, pork soup dumplings tasted terrible and the shu mai were dreadful. Now, I've had good Dim Sum and bad Dim Sum, but this was truly terrible."
Carol C.,/user_details?userid=sRgtWyKOA7iZpKMaL3oHBw,"Brooklyn, NY",8/17/2018,5,Really nice place with great food and amazing presentation. Every dish was well worth the price. Would definitely come back again

l a.,/user_details?userid=f4RWGjmAlTwAdUi6E2Jy7A,"Manhattan, NY",4/5/2018,1,Food was pretty good. Fast. Overpriced for dim sum. Duck spring roll was disgusting but loved everything else. Toward the end of our meal a big house centipede appeared on the table. I had to Google pictures of centipedes to figure out what it was. I'm still disgusted. The waiter was there and pushed it to the floor. Just too gross. Call the exterminator.
Amanda C.,/user_details?userid=kUZE0j7t__kQwBCCmrLYLQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/21/2018,4,"Solid dim sum spot!! We got a variety of dishes, including the pork / chive dumplings which were delicious! The service was good. We went right when it opened at 11 am on Sunday, and were seated right away. Will definitely be going back!"
Anna D.,/user_details?userid=pDrCzdSa1kyE9frG8hsZmA,"Springfield, VA",1/19/2019,5,This place has excellent service and delicious food! We came on a Tuesday afternoon and was seated right away.

Alejandro D.,/user_details?userid=QFVneYhZoRaGLaU3rrlhBA,"San Jose, CA",10/15/2018,5,"Can't speak for anything other than the dim sum here. Came in during happy hour and ordered 8 items. The half off happy hour makes it so affordable to eat. My bill came out to less than $30. It's nothing fancy but for the quality you're getting, it's totally worth it. Another plus is it's next to Times Square.  Definitely recommend if you're passing though the area."
Wade W.,/user_details?userid=GVtv1veEedV92Vurq3CEIA,"Roseville, CA",1/8/2020,5,Great DimSum and all other dishes were delicious...full bar and very attentive...so good we went back the next day....
Kesha B.,/user_details?userid=IsEzXZ__21cqOWpIPrDatw,"St. Albans, NY",11/23/2019,5,Great food! Food was delicious. This restaurant had a wide range of dumplings. Entree portions were large. The waiter was great and very friendly. He was also good at making recommendations since we were not sure what to order.
A. B.,/user_details?userid=aSI4hZV6b4Q-8dQ8gkQ6bg,"Washington, DC",1/24/2018,5,"While I don't have a lot of experience in the Art of Dim Sum as the trip here was my first specifically for this type of dish, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to the beginner!  In fact, now I'm hungry for Dim Sum and can't seem to find a place that would be comparable.  They were busy and appeared popular with Chinese families, which I took as a good sign of authentic Dim Sum.  It IS a little cramped at some tables and you can easily run out of table top with multiple dishes, but service is fast and friendly and they do a good job rotating your plates through and keeping up on any needs or wants.  I can't wait to go back!"

The sesame chicken is delectable. The pork fried rice was by far the best I've ever had. The egg and vegetable soup wasn't particularly my favorite, but that was probably my personal tastes as it seemed very well put together. This place is definitely worth a try."
Angela Y.,/user_details?userid=hDuJDk6K5K7nm1nE0RnyVw,"New York, NY",2/7/2018,4,Great place for dim sum in midtown. The decoration is good for a Chinese restaurant. Both eat-in and takeaway are good quality
Christopher L.,/user_details?userid=xl5XlsZez0mBbb_XpDi2pA,"Seattle, WA",11/14/2019,4,"This was some pretty solid Dim Sum. I tried the pork short ribs too, but they weren't as good and were mostly bones. The dim sum dough was tasty enough and had an appropriate texture. The various flavors of the ingredients all came through and tasted fresh enough. Nothing was particularly innovative, but the dim sum didn't short change on the meat, even the duck. The staff were reasonably friendly too. All in all, a solid choice."
Melanie H.,/user_details?userid=HleFtZzZXQcIpGFTZudgUA,"Miami, FL",12/28/2018,4,Quick service and the food was sooooo good! Great authentic Chinese restaurant not far from Times Square!
Tiffany H.,/user_details?userid=Hx8GwC3Tm4sdo_QI1XP0Eg,"Leesburg, VA",12/27/2018,3,This was our first attempt at Dim Sum. The place was packed and small. A good thing for how good the food is but not so good for elbow room. If you love Dim Sum check this place out. If you are new to the experience some of the Dim Sum options are a little too different for my palate.
Quan L.,/user_details?userid=b32XyB23Gn2ivN_imjpHWA,"Austin, TX",9/21/2018,3,Simple and common... price us too high for nothing particular...  nothing compare to Hong Kong Dim Sum!

Pablo P.,/user_details?userid=bffShiRwyBynVazcZQUbkQ,"Falls Church, VA",2/19/2018,4,"Came here at the recommendation of my nephew and was not disappointed. It was busy and full but we only ended up waiting about 15 minutes (or less). We ordered more than a dozen different things over two rounds and it was all delicious except for the steamed spare ribs with olive sauce--the ribs left much to be desired in terms of flavor and texture but the olive sauce was delicious. It's hard to pick just one great dish but some of the more popular ones at the table were the scallion pancakes, shu-mai, pan fried tiny buns, and chicken juicy pork bun. The price seemed totally reasonable at about $7/plate which had 2+ servings depending on what you order. The cold sake was delicious but pricier at $38/200 ml bottle. The service was quick and efficient but not overbearing. I'd happily return."
Cainna C.,/user_details?userid=WvF-eGy-z3V5x-27CcyIYA,"Charlottesville, VA",2/9/2020,5,I was looking for a late night taste.  They are open late and it's not a diner.  Delicious and beautiful food.  You MUST get the cream cheese and pineapple Rangoons.  Their dumplings are tasty af!!  The crispy fried Hong Kong noodles are very delicious.  Lots of food so be sure to share.  Also that Mai Thai
Kira P.,/user_details?userid=FHoM2yoFoGElbFV7BQAakQ,"Tulsa, OK",1/23/2018,4,"A very fun experience. I'm not a dim sum expert but I've had several  dumplings several times. Dim Sum palace had a wide selection as well as Chinese food options. We had a table of 8 AMS the service was great. The dim sum came out as it was ready (which we didn't mind) and our table probably ordered 12ish different dim sum dishes plus Kung Pao chicken, vegetable fried rice & something else. All were good - seemed like food is heavy on ginger which is unfortunate because I personally don't like ginger. The veggie fried rice  was delicious. The pineapple  cheese wontons were delicious- small but a good unique flavor. Based on reviews we ordered the ribs and those were challenging to eat - we didn't enjoys those. I would not recommend. If you are a texture eater, I would stick to fried dumplings."
Madison I.,/user_details?userid=WzLEq9hu2SfQwrZOX7JFqQ,"New York, NY",10/1/2019,1,"I am confused by the reviews on this place. If you think this place is good, you're delusional."

Carlos D.,/user_details?userid=GIoIb40pC6u-acOL0hXU3A,"Southeast Washington, Washington, DC",6/11/2017,3,"Dim Sum Palace is a good place to get your Dim Sum fix in the Theater District.  And, they serve late, which is a plus. As one might imagine in this part of town, prices are high, portions are small. Food is entirely acceptable. They have a full bar, and serve some decent wines."
Cynthia C.,/user_details?userid=BCCVVAZuz9CF0GJIp6pWUQ,"New York, NY",12/3/2016,5,"One of the better dimsum places. The siu mai, chicken feet, and congee were most impressive. Definitely a repeat restaurant. There is a premium on food and tea but worth it."
Robert G.,/user_details?userid=Qn8uuDQnmApid40Yox9odg,"Kapolei, HI",8/28/2018,5,Large selection of dim sum plus other Chinese dish staples you'd expect.

Asheley K.,/user_details?userid=frnj_JVTtgI3IbFfYrlDAQ,"Port Orange, FL",8/16/2018,5,"My favorite place to eat during our recent trip to New York. The food was incredible and very fun to eat.

Huey N.,/user_details?userid=L_4vXRdrtEHLQTVB6lZ3Iw,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",8/12/2018,2,"I always heard NYC had the best Chinese food, well someone lied. While being in NYC I was craving Chinese food however with so many restaurants around I decided to let yelp and the ratings help me out. I found Dim Sum with 4 stars so I figure this must be the spot. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. I ordered the Crispy Calamari (nasty) the traditional fried rice ( average ) ... had better fried rice. And tried a Chinese dumpling ( average)... I was very disappointed after eating my food.. I had to put lots of duck sauce and hot sauce to just give my food some flavor. If anyone reads this and is in NYC... I would not recommend eating food if you want really good Chinese food. Just my opinion."

Mery R.,/user_details?userid=PbNHTGDcZBgaH9x6QeKz6A,"Humble, TX",12/2/2017,5,"This place is located in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. The restaurant is not too big but it does get fairly busy. The food will be more pricey than what you would find in Chinatown but in my opinion it's worth it. Their menu has a good variety of items outside dim sum but I'd say dim sum is definitely the items to try. It's not a classic you pick from the cart experience, you actually order from a menu but there are lots of pictures for those who are not quite familiar with dim sum dishes or names. Everything we tried was delicious but the highlight for me was definitely the sweet custard buns. The buns were ooey, creamy, just the right amount of sweetness - it was the holy grail of sweet custard buns for us! The service was fairly good for a Chinese restaurant, probably because it's located in Hell's Kitchen. A must try if you're in the area and wanting dim sum!"

I saw the menu and thought it would be authentic Chinese food but it was not worth the cost by any means."

All would have landed in his lap should he not noticed it a split second before it happened. We got an evasive ""sorry"" and that was that. Disappointing."

We ordered three types of dumplings and they all looked exactly alike. When they delivered they also did not include napkins or any utensils, so we had to eat with our hands. We would never order from here again."
Jamie D.,/user_details?userid=BbSBn_pJiQrw8eJ-Ktf1Iw,"San Diego, CA",8/29/2017,3,"We came here at 11AM, right when they opened and were seated immediately. Many items were not available during this time, which was disappointing. Fortunately, the things that that were available were tasty! I liked their xiao long bao and chicken feet! Their shumai and har gow were good, as well. The price per plate was high, though... The service was fast and the workers were very friendly!"
Shijia W.,/user_details?userid=wDv3IVexV9Brx9fFvY7bDg,"Jersey City, NJ",11/27/2019,1,Extremely rude waiter and manager forcing us to sit at a tiny table for 2 instead of a table of 4 even though they had plenty of tables available. The manager obviously has no clue what basic manner is. Disgusted by this place.
Amy L.,/user_details?userid=UZMeIB5XuWnYxcoTlbK_EA,"Denver, CO",2/8/2018,5,"No reason to come to Times Square except for this place! Amazing dim sum and great friendly service. One of my favorite dim sum places in the world. (Including China) highly recommend, 10/10. Get the fried green tea mochi balls for dessert!"
David P.,/user_details?userid=7GFkMr1LOR9Mt_e3boo5wA,"Orlando, FL",2/8/2018,5,Maybe one of the best meals I've had in my life. My girlfriend and I plan on eating here every time we visit NY. Great place to grab a bite before seeing a show!

Jackie B.,/user_details?userid=I50LerNoy4vJC5xFG0IL8g,"New York, NY",5/23/2017,5,"I love this place! Best Chinese food in the city that I have tried so far. I have only had delivery from here, but the chive and pork dumplings were plump and juicy, the General Tsos and Sweet and Sour chicken were crispy and flavorful and I love how they give the side of the chili oil. Their crispy green tea rice balls are greasy but delicious. I get them every time!"
Ace M.,/user_details?userid=UJ1EVvkv2GN7aNBj8xm8qQ,"Orange, CA",11/7/2017,5,"Really good dim sum. Everything tasted freshly made. We didn't have to wait long when we got there. All the dishes came out fast and we really filled our stomaches up. This place is different because you write down what you want instead of them bringing a cart full of dim sum. We ordered the typical dishes such as har gow, shu mai, pork ribs, bbq pork buns, shrimp rolls... nothing was bad that we tried on the menu."
Ryo A.,/user_details?userid=a8TO6Wtr4RM516zJgtBb4Q,"Manhattan, NY",4/14/2018,4,"Reasonable and yummy. Farther more the interior is so clean. I strongly recommend it to you. We ordered spring roll, dumplings and fried noodle."
Michael P.,/user_details?userid=yXNqu-rxIxBvnVYsKHLnBg,"Los Angeles, CA",11/3/2017,3,"Not the best dim sum place but it is Hell's kitchen after alll. The dumplings themselves were mediocre but passable. Stay away from the soup dumplings. After a while the wrappers become hardened. The pan fried mini buns were good. The ha Gao, which is the dish I use to judge a place, didn't taste that fresh. Despite all of this, there was still a good number of Asian customers so I guess that's a good sign."
Blake C.,/user_details?userid=TesPi4yShguDLmsK0yfBLQ,"San Marcos, CA",2/23/2017,1,Got food poisoning here and was pretty sick for my entire trip in New York. Really a bummer wish we had a better experience. Came here based on reviews. Spent 5 days throwing up and in bed.
Sathvik R.,/user_details?userid=XQWj2NItKu3bizCpkVaaOw,"Chicago, IL",4/8/2018,4,"I'll be a bit biased in my review here as someone who is used to have authentic spicy food , their pork dim sum in a soup kinda thing makes it hot and awesome to eat with, We truly enjoyed that! Not so much of an ambienece oriented place but serves the purpose, The fried rice was okay to go with."

We like most the pan fried shrimp & chives dumplings, shu mai (shrimp & pork), and a few others on the platter that we were unsure of which they were. They have discounted lunch pricing 11-4pm."
Aemilia T.,/user_details?userid=WFQXd6gVYp0sWjUQA_AQPg,"Toronto, Canada",1/19/2018,4,"I had dim sum here. Taste was decent, and service was good. Price is reasonable. If you don't want to go to flushing, this is a good place to have dim sum in Manhattan."
Megan T.,/user_details?userid=7aQtdqg_s76c-SJDgSL_UQ,"Rochester, NY",4/4/2017,5,"I came here with a friend before seeing Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812. We tried a small selection of their Dim Sum offerings and we thought everything was fantastic! Some items are really hot (especially the green tea dessert) but the impeccable tastes completely made up for the initial scalding. We were seated right away and given our choice of seating area. We sat in the hallway that the servers use so there was a lot of hustling and bustling around but it really didn't affect our experience. They had no problem adding items to our order when we decided we were still hungry for dessert. I'm so glad there is quality Dim Sum available as pre-theater dinner!"
Ron E.,/user_details?userid=0pled4JIW9jjuuMxMNkZCA,"Manhattan, NY",8/10/2017,3,"Went there last night, the location keeps this place going.  The place is sparce as is the atmosphere.  The dim sum was heated up with microwave as it all came out in minutes and all at the same time. Fresh Dim Sum is steamed and takes rime to prepare. This was heated dim sum. Mediocre at best!  I can understand the big prices because of the excellent location but the taste of the food brought the whole experience down.  I know and  cherish my regular place pn Pell Street in Chinatown with the carts passing the dim sum as they come and go.  I hope they will stay in buisness because the staff is trying hard to make this new place work but with food like this I'm not sure they can.  My suggestion is to sevrve traditional dim sum in the carts at certain times and in off hours heat up the food but not ny microwave.  The food was not great."
Ted G.,/user_details?userid=KlFyNwZnJpNNqylCpU-urQ,"Sunnyside, NY",3/20/2018,5,"A delightful variety of dim sum far from any of NY's Chinatowns -- bring enough people to run the dim sum menu -- add an order of sautéed snow pea shoots, and try the Rose Tea, made with rose petals -- sublime!"

We had shrimp dumplings, seafood shu mai and the shrimp rice noodle rolls. All were excellent! Great service! The lady here knows her stuff!! All the dim sum is prepared fresh by the chef each morning. Nothing is frozen and you can taste the freshness. Open late too!!"
Liisaa L.,/user_details?userid=rtObp4jCcqgskKQaYqOafw,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",6/9/2018,3,"Food was average at best. Portions were tiny (e.g small bowl of congee for $6.25). Was rather disappointed at food and quality. They also charge extremely high prices but understandable as they are located near Times Square. Service was good, restrooms are clean. Wouldn't recommend to my friends and family."
Yuki U.,/user_details?userid=GRozeu6r6y0xjNXhgjSEjA,"New York, NY",12/28/2017,3,"I tried a couple of Dim Sum and other dishes at this restaurant. They were delicious ,but I thought they were more expensive than my expectations. I didn't see any Chinese customers which was weird for me."
Zesty C.,/user_details?userid=jjXlfsM_ruKjL-Gs7H6Bbw,"Bethesda, MD",5/27/2018,4,"I would give it a 3.75, its not bad at all due to the close proximity to our hotel, it was fairly quick and the food wasn't half bad b/c we were starving unlike most of the dim sum restaurants in chinatown nyc, yes granted it reminded me of dim sum outside of nyc and/or queens flushing. It is overpriced but look at the neighborhood it is in, they have to pay a crapload of rent. So if you are seeking convenience and do not want to wait two hours for a 1 star michelin dim sum place then go here."
Kristy F.,/user_details?userid=iXUdFKgdaykZYWS82Da-vw,"New York, NY",2/24/2018,3,The soup dumplings were dry and mushy! The congee was good but overpriced. Limited dim sum selection. Really cramped sitting area.
Thom N.,/user_details?userid=c1gCX8uV4QRG9m2xkTgM7A,"Brea, CA",2/23/2018,1,"Dim sum was so-so... Yelp reviews totally fooled me into trying this place... I was SO disappointed... service was the worse I ever had... we had to flag down the server after 15 minutes to order and flag them down again to ask for the sauces... then our food came out and we finished before my husband's drink even came out. We asked for the check and said to just cancel the drink. The waiter was even giving us trouble saying it's being made even though we finished our orders...then he went to get the owner/manager who had the drink and asked if we still wanted it. Mind you, the drink is in his hands and when we said no, he proceeded to drink it in front of us and walked away.... wow. Lol. I had to go down the street to get a pizza and they had better service."
Miaoqi Z.,/user_details?userid=ZaAY1228uGvfqxfWNJV5nA,"Cleveland Heights, OH",5/26/2018,5,They give a free dessert for my birthday! All the food are very authentic and we will definitely come again!
Helen V.,/user_details?userid=kTcNO20q7KsQ_jBJpoA2AA,"Parlin, NJ",12/9/2017,5,"This place is amazing!! It's off the busy streets of Broadway and the service is attentive and quick. We had a variety of Dim Sum and some General Tso's chicken! It was the best I've ever had!! Tender, juicy, spicy and sweet, with some ginger to cleanse your palette."
Leigh H.,/user_details?userid=06RbJtTq7EcIpbyQTshKpw,"Richmond, VA",9/27/2017,4,"For a Chinese person traveling from a small city in Virginia to NYC, i think that this restaurant is great. I came here for lunch and got the lunch special including a dim sum sample platter, beef stew, lotus roots and celery stir-fry and kongpao beef. All wee tasty. The place was clean, well managed, and waiters were relatively friendly. I would have come back if I were to visit NYC next time."
Neha J.,/user_details?userid=2c2lBiqJ16HHkxu3QmshGA,"Manhattan, NY",5/16/2018,4,"A good option for Oriental food.

Found mixed reviews about this place and decided that we are explorers who need not err on the side of caution, but instead plunge positively into what could be a disaster or a success. This was definitely a success. Very fast and pleasant service, clean and our meal was super fast and so delicious. We over ordered (we realized this when all of our dishes couldn't quite fit on our table) and we still ate it ALL.... oops but YUM!!!"

V P.,/user_details?userid=odouGdWf-LwaI2h9H272dA,"Washington, DC",9/1/2019,4,"Good fast service. Dishes were well made. Prices, especially for vegetable dishes were a bit high.  Dim sum dish selection could have been wider."
Hal D.,/user_details?userid=QRGtYhDV5gwIpa_erkpXBA,"Los Angeles, CA",4/25/2017,4,I'm a dim sum fanatic. I've gone by myself at times ignoring the social stigma of dining alone.  This place was good but a little pricey for dim sum. chalk it up to real estate prices maybe? a little stingy with portions as well but overall an acceptable place to get your dim sum fix
Joe G.,/user_details?userid=rrixomIlP7NBNKYPbAJdMw,"Noblesville, IN",1/26/2018,5,Very good and reasonably priced and if you go home hungry that is your own fault! The menu is layer out very simply for quick ordering and the service was fantastic !
Lucy C.,/user_details?userid=T3Qpy5ixVcPSKW4SArYtRg,"New York, NY",12/5/2016,4,"Great food! Came here for brunch with a friend ordered a few dim sum as well as hot entrees from the lunch menu. Let me start off by saying that the place is seemingly clean, has good service, enjoys an average volume (no one is screaming), and prices are great! I highly recommend the shrimp rice wrap and steamed chicken feet. Perhaps slightly more expensive than Chinatown but certainly better quality. Duck egg congee couldve been more generous on the egg and meat but huge plate of singaporean noodles was $9.95! It was really flavorful without being too oily. We also ordered a Cantonese eggplant dish that was totally forgotten but they gladly took it off the menu when we complained about it (most other Chinese restaurants would've made a fuss). Walked away very satisfied and will definitely be back!"
Amy D.,/user_details?userid=6dOfss3_MzkmOShoqeVIJA,"Santa Clara, CA",11/13/2017,5,"We went for happy hour from 3 to 6 then we came back later on that night around 11:30. This place opens late.

Nick C.,/user_details?userid=kL3xkx-S3ZZ7Cgc0iWZzwg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/26/2018,5,"Wanted to get some good non-tourist spots for dim sum. This place hit the spot. A lot of options for dim some and some regular full dish items that looked good but we didn't get any. Gf ordered some vegetarian, potentially vegan, Buddha's delete and mixed vegetable dumplings and liked both of them. I got the juicy pork dumplings which were very good! Would definitely recommend"
Sej D.,/user_details?userid=8C1vtBNuGc7doDjRHpwIdg,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",6/8/2017,4,One of the few places with more than one vegetarian dim sum options.  Go here if you want to satisfy a craving.  Great service and with a huge smile!
Matt W.,/user_details?userid=gHNpwcLKV_rlalBcZDYdmQ,"Wilmington, NC",2/13/2017,2,Got delivery to the hotel. The scallion pancakes and vegetable spring rolls were OK. We have better near us in North Carolina. All of the dumplings and soft dim sum were decent. But not worth the price. And they didn't give us enough sauce for everybody involved. $40 worth of stuff with only one soy sauce to go around? I would not order here again.
Susan K.,/user_details?userid=8-3IZRktnwhb8sUsq1R0kw,"South Richmond Hill, NY",4/23/2017,4,They have an awesome happy hour. 3-5pm 50% off the dim sum menu. Their shu mai & har gow were some of the best I've had.

Kai C.,/user_details?userid=nxWeZQsAozJB4TVXuu2TSQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1/9/2018,5,"Very good quality, great efficient service, food prepared quickly (great if you're hungry) and fresh ingredients.  Agree with other reviewers that you could get more variety (and cheaper) in Chinatown or Flushing, but it's great for dim sum/Cantonese food cravings in Midtown.  They have the classics (shrimp dumplings, turnip cake, roast pork buns) but also some newer creations (mushroom dumplings- really good!).  They have quite a good wine selection compared to most Asian restaurants.  I work nearby and this place is great for a pre-show dinner or quick bite before heading home."

We ordered 5 different items off the Dim Sum menu, which was plenty of food for two women. The service was friendly and fast, and when the menu came we were shocked - $24!!!  For dinner for two!  In NYC!  On restaurant row!  I will certainly be coming back here. My only complaint is that there was pork in a LOT of the Dim Sum. I would have liked a few more vegetarian or seafood options."
Nicolle Z.,/user_details?userid=4KfZ4R9Fh45FYZoxWThW6g,"San Diego, CA",9/27/2019,5,Great food! Especially if you're craving late night dim sum. Lots of variety on the menu and if you have people in your party who want something else other than dim sum they have other options too.

Overall I would say they are very efficient, the food is on a smaller size in terms of portions, the food quality/taste is fairly good - not amazing. The service is very good. We went there on a Wednesday evening and it was pretty packed. I like that they had Dim Sim in the evenings and you could try many things."
David W.,/user_details?userid=t271LQBO8ULdNcOfkFJSbg,"Columbia, SC",6/5/2018,5,Food was excellent.  All dishes we got were flavorful and my Chicken Lo Mein was unbelievable.

Of course, for the price, nobody expects fillet, but there are limits as to which pieces of the animal can be served, and this beef took the cookie; it was completely inedible, pieces the butcher would give you for free to feed the dogs. I cannot comment on a anything else, and the many reviews indicate that the dim sum may be good; however, if I have one piece of advice to customers, it is: stay away from the beef!"

We had the pork and shrimp siu mai (excellent), har gow, crab and pork soup dumplings (our fave), crispy pork spare ribs (mmmm!), and chicken lo mein. Everything was delicious. Bill came to $50 with 2 beers. If u don't want to bother going to any of the Chinatowns, this place won't disappoint. Service was also excellent."
Caterina R.,/user_details?userid=cSa0JrvH8iuvmLxJtuQyBg,"Mansfield, CT",2/17/2019,2,No wait and the food was just okay. Their soy bean dumplings were really good. There was a pile of poop in the bathroom floor though.
Johanna S.,/user_details?userid=aLzKvKLxCsfyuTENvPULeg,"Hollywood, FL",9/2/2017,4,"A nice hidden jewel, Dim Sum Palace is at the restaurant row in Manhattan and is a perfect place to have Dim Sum without having to run to China Town, very taste and good selection."
Adrian R.,/user_details?userid=-RVD4yRA6kswJ13hzYedjg,"Mesa, AZ",10/24/2019,5,Good service and the food came out so fast! So impressed and the restaurant is so nice
Alicia M.,/user_details?userid=9c-C26dSdTkjCOQAkoZ6ug,"Concord, NH",11/7/2017,4,This review is specifically for delivery on a Monday night. Ordered pork buns and vegetable noodles. Delivery was fast!  Menu has a lot of good options. Pork buns were very good and did not taste like delivery dim sum. Vegetable noodles are nothing spectacular but tasted good. I would definitely order more dim sum from them next time I'm in town.
Sandra V.,/user_details?userid=O8XRh9E0OCq9cy9EQ1v4Qw,"Manhattan, NY",7/7/2016,5,Really good food! Friendly staff! One of the best I had! I would extremely recommend it!! Would def be back! Today was my second time in two days!

Alice X.,/user_details?userid=JNyOgvHHxqBG2M2oxQSSBw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11/3/2017,5,"The best dim sum and the most traditional Chinese restaurant in Manhattan, very HongKong Style. You don't need to go to HongKong to have nice dim sum. Seriously!! And the staffs are super nice. Love this place!!! Will order or eat in when I feel like dim sum for 100% sure!!!!"
Octavio C.,/user_details?userid=oF5FmxANct8r8FtM2IYi6g,"Bronx, NY",5/7/2018,5,"Wow. Food is amazing. I am impressed. Fast, clean, very well prepared, waiter very professional. I would definitely come back and recommend people to stop by and have a look at the menu!!"
Holly B.,/user_details?userid=47Sn35Dj79JphtbcuNTzFw,"Boston, MA",5/5/2018,3,"The tables were setup horizontally and too close to each other. I had to squeeze in to sit down. Since my chair space was tight, I could not even fit in my handbag behind me. (Minus 1 Star for uncomfortable seating) We did not order too many dim sum dishes. I liked their chicken siu mai and fried spareribs. Overall the dim sum were fresh and tasty."
Jessica C.,/user_details?userid=iRnoxSzxJhVCQPTXsOkW_g,"Needham Heights, MA",8/31/2019,5,"Nice and fresh made to order, fast and friendly services, and clean restaurant. Authentic dim sum!  Will definitely come back again when we visit NYC!"
Joanna M.,/user_details?userid=enMejZCjTQGP-1ODtKbqAA,"Sandy Springs, GA",6/6/2017,5,"This was a unique dim sum experience. It is a small restaurant with lots of seating but not really any room for the dim sum carts to go around. Instead, you order those items from a nice paper menu that has photos of each item. They come out very hot and fresh since they are made after ordering. We didn't order any of the big dishes, just a bunch of small plates which were really good. Service was great too, but they seemed confused sometimes about whether they already served you what you order, so make sure you keep up with those numbers if you ordered a whole lot like we did."
Cindy P.,/user_details?userid=Ndxt-pSeLAI64xEMFrUBzQ,"Staunton, VA",4/30/2018,4,"Dim Sum Yum- on a recent visit to NYC we were determined to find a place with walnut shrimp on the menu.  SCORE!  The dim sum was tasty and the wait shrimp out of this world. The restaurant is small and a bit tight, but the service was good."
Junjie C.,/user_details?userid=pVhUJY4eUaMl5qxaACRY_g,"Washington, DC",8/12/2017,5,"Not so bad. Heard it's quite popular in midtown. Can't beat the location. The dishes are fine, no cart running around so not so dim-sum, but the place is nice in general."
Vivi N.,/user_details?userid=PedwffWkzBrmgx9sW7o9rg,"Waldorf, MD",9/10/2016,5,"My boyfriend and I came here last week for a quick dinner before heading back to DC. The food was quite good and fresh. There was nothing to complain about. However, we were impressed by the customer service here. After paying for the dinner, we left and my boyfriend unfortunately dropped his wallet in front of the restaurant.(there was no money in there tho) We actually didn't notice that the wallet was gone until we arrived at DC. Later on, (after a panic moment )we got a phone call from my apartment that somebody found his wallet( my Driver license was in there too). It was the owner (or manager) that found out the wallet and tried to contact us. We don't know what to say to express our thankfulness. We really appreciated your kindness. Keep on doing the good work!"
Angela M.,/user_details?userid=4KAcCoUhNLQhWegmFauBhg,"Tustin, CA",5/13/2017,5,"Conveniently located to the theater district - perfect light meal after the show. Small bar with some premium brands for cocktails. Dim Sum only after 11pm. We had Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, fresh Snow Pea Leaves and Shrimp & Pork Shumai - so yummy! Don't forget the Sesame Balls for dessert: not too sweet, but satisfying after a meal. Great service, too. Definitely returning on my next visit to the Big Apple!"
Lance H.,/user_details?userid=I0CL8GJbN8WQNVpAUumdZA,"South Jordan, UT",4/28/2017,3,"The price was fine and it was an easy walk from Time's Square.  Service was friendly.  I just wasn't overly impressed with the food.  That's not to say it was bad, but I've had better Shanghai Dumplings.   I'd go here again simply because it is close to work, but this is not a place to make a special trip to eat at."

I would say for the quality you get the price is right.  Everything we ordered was out of this world. Fried wontons, won ton soup, cashew chicken, orange chicken beef fried rice and fun noodles where all excellent."
Sam A.,/user_details?userid=vTBsY9aSmJJuvzNoErFWng,"New York, NY",1/10/2018,5,"Really great for team/group dinners. Excellent range of items on the menu. Although it's probably not as good as the places in Flushing or deep Brooklyn, it's one of the best in Manhattan (unless you're looking for xiao long bao specifically, then go to Hot Sichuan in Chelsea)."
Ken L.,/user_details?userid=LiYCruFTrdxJ_ReeMGZUiQ,"Northbrook, IL",8/22/2019,5,"We went there for late lunch. We ordered dim sums, chicken chow fun and sautéed peashoot with fresh garlic. All dishes were much more greater than what we expected and really excellent.  All of food were made to order and very fresh and tasteful. Sam, the owner of the restaurant and other servers were very friendly and pay lots of attention to the guests. We will go there again whenever we want to eat Chinese cuisine in Manhattan."
Sally P.,/user_details?userid=Q_70XS1Sb9AWHpFrS6JYkw,"Los Angeles, CA",6/15/2017,4,"Convenient location to grab a quick bite prior to a broadway show. Service was very fast and courteous, and food was above average. The wonton soup, pan fried baos, shrimp stuffed tofu, and Shu Mai are delicious. The one let down was the Xiao Long Baos, where the dumpling skin was too thick. Not much of an ambience, but it's all about the food."
Sarah E.,/user_details?userid=s0RlMkTNgnG43sE_Ik4a0g,"New Orleans, LA",7/26/2017,5,"Incredible dim sum! They have a fairly large selection, each item made to order. The food arrives pretty fast, and it's usually staggered, so if you order quite a few things like my sister and I do, then you don't need to worry about it all arriving at the same time. I will definitely come back."
Heather C.,/user_details?userid=qNL4K1GMkBa_qlYLProBlg,"North Augusta, SC",1/4/2018,4,Enjoyed time with friends here and we all ordered different things off the menu and shared like a family meal style. It was really fresh and good. The tea was incredible! The atmosphere was great too.
Debbie C.,/user_details?userid=EAPtzn-PMG2RmWbFvONLvw,"Punta Gorda, FL",6/10/2017,4,We came here for an early dinner and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had about 4 different dim sums for the two of us and they were all good. Many Chinese folks were also dining there so we felt it was pretty authentic and good if they chose it as well. The service was fine and restroom was clean. We would return.

Monte H.,/user_details?userid=hjbljNSmdUW8R34UiIm9Bg,"Cupertino, CA",8/29/2016,3,"When the staff is nice but terribly disorganized, and the food has decent flavor but there is limited selection and issues with several of the types of dumplings skins, I'd normally be torn between 2 stars ""meh I've experienced better"" and 3 stars ""A-OK."" BUT this is midtown and for those of us who made poor decisions not to live in lower manhattan, this place gets an extra bump for being able to fulfill cravings without making me schlep all the way to chinatown or flushing. Warning, they charge extra for tea, which is bs at a dim sum restaurant, but again - midtown."
Mik D.,/user_details?userid=BrIWHm48uaC1BcNxzLYSrA,"Toronto, Canada",4/1/2018,5,Simply some of the best dim sum I've ever had!  Great service. Reasonable prices. Eat here!
Justin C.,/user_details?userid=A7tG6NubxLIod8lOGJu3hA,"Columbia, MD",12/21/2016,3,Menu is very limited compared to other dim sum restaurants. Flavors were mediocre. Not to mention over priced and the Chrysanthemum tea was $8. Enjoy. I'll be going somewhere else next time that also has carts for the real experience.
Alexander C.,/user_details?userid=LzS877cUx8xDr1sJ75r4nA,"Miami Beach, FL",9/24/2017,5,"Food was delicious! Great dim sum, especially the shu mai. Also enjoyed the kung pow chicken and noodles, and egg yolk for dessert. Overall great dining experience in great location."
Robert G.,/user_details?userid=CQHQyhnbBYRN3xu4Bepz8g,"Austin, TX",4/2/2017,5,"Solid, authentic, non-nonsense dim sum and affordable Chinese close to the action in HK. Delicious legitimate grub when your need Chinese and in you're in the hood."
Alexander C.,/user_details?userid=BmeUkY9PU2_6IgGILX8AJg,"Arcadia, CA",6/29/2019,2,"I was honestly pretty disappointed with this place. After reading a lot of the other reviews, I was hoping this would be my ""go to"" dim sum spot in New York, but that sadly was not the case. I tried the shrimp dumplings, chicken feet, preserved egg and pork porridge, sticky rice, and fried pork bun. The shrimp dumplings were bland and a bit rubbery. The chicken feet lacked depth in flavor, they mostly just tasted like vinegar. The preserved egg and pork porridge was not bad, just a little bland and a very small portion. The sticky rice was actually pretty good, it just also had a small portion. The fried pork bun didn't have enough pork in the filling (it was mostly cabbage) and the dough was too light/fluffy for a fried bun. It reminds me of the frozen buns you can buy from the asian grocery stores. Overall most of the portions were quite small and the prices were very high for bland dim sum. All the ingredients seemed to be of good quality, but was just lacking in flavor."

Carla C.,/user_details?userid=xgDZBIo64ItdjTMMtN0nwA,"West End, Washington, DC",8/16/2016,5,"We came here after midnight starving. Hands down the shrimp dumplings were the best thing. Close tie were the seafood shu Mai. We also got the crispy garlic spare ribs , pan fried pork and chives dumplings and the shredded roast duck dumplings. Everything was delicious. I would recommend this place for a dim sum where you don't have to travel to China town for. I love how not everything is fried. A must try"

Debbie L.,/user_details?userid=6C179Jqm3xdh103I4HGZcA,"Stamford, CT",8/10/2019,5,"Impressive- very welcoming and accommodating to locals AND people unfamiliar with the area and the food. Loved the sweet and sour steak and onions and the prawns with walnuts and honey. All the dim sum that passed our table looked appetizing as well. Prices reasonable, especially for NYC. Enjoyed a pot of chrysanthemum tea too. Will be sure to go back when I'm in the area."
Lawrence M.,/user_details?userid=cfwO4J9Cb0B7cGhSZ0S83Q,"Chicago, IL",8/1/2016,5,"Best Chinese delivery in Manhattan! Great dim sum dumplings, West Lake Soup absolutely rocks! Tasty Peking Duck and awesome fried rice. Not cheap but worth every penny! Loved it!!!"
Chad A.,/user_details?userid=Ik0obH-eVbA8Whgmngwj1A,"Decatur, GA",6/24/2019,4,Xiao Long Bao was good. I had half a roasted duck and it was pretty greasy even by duck standards. All the other dim sum was hot and tasty. Wouldn't hesitate to come back.
Bonnie L.,/user_details?userid=K5h7hFHkveGrDVaG9OA6QQ,"Waterbury, CT",9/25/2019,1,"It was a massive disappointment. First time here, we had Dim sum and food was below average/not fresh. Overall , it was pricey for what you got."
Jackson S.,/user_details?userid=w01khq70EyeFukIYWzqlTQ,"South Central Houston, Houston, TX",9/11/2017,3,"The food is ok not that exciting. The service is pretty slow, it took awhile for me to get the food I order. The price was higher than I thought."
A C.,/user_details?userid=a1P6y3xa82CQYGZ054S8wQ,"New York, NY",8/6/2020,5,"This place is incredible! I got a take out order so am reviewing on the food alone, specifically the veggie dumpling platter and turnip cake. Normally, I only eat dim sum in Hong Kong because I go there 6 times a year, and it's the best there. Today was my first time ordering from Dim Sum Palace, and I did not have any  expectations (usually Chinese dumplings in NY are not as good as in China, naturally). But the dumplings I ordered really surprised me!  The refined taste, texture  of fillings, and quality is on par with 5-star hotel restaurants in China. And this was me eating the dumplings 20 mins after picking them up, barely warm, out of plastic take-out containers. I'm Chinese-American, so I know what good Chinese food is. The dim sum I ordered tastes exactly as is served in the best restaurants in China.  We are lucky to have this gem in New York during Covid and need to help support these local restaurants now more than ever!"
Joseph L.,/user_details?userid=y4Bg8GkFrgvLBYPHY3GvrQ,"Edison, NJ",6/30/2017,5,Very good food as well as the service. We were a party of 8 on a Friday night. Wait was short. Food was good. If we're nearby again we will be visiting again.
Eric D.,/user_details?userid=bFvaIKEDlmDmYEtHUXBvYw,"Chatham Township, NJ",12/10/2017,3,"Just happened to randomly walk into this place as my friend and I hadn't had dim sums in a while. Although I'd give 4 stars for the food, I had to take one star off because of the ignorance of the staff who brought us our food. We ordered a variety of dim Sums, out of which the taro pork was our favorite. However, when we reordered the same dish, this time it came in with Only scallions and pork and the server kept on insisting that the images on the menu don't match with the food sometimes. We insisted that there wasn't any taro in the pork while our previous order had a visible amount and tasted of taro. But this man seemed pretty confident which added to our frustration given that he didn't speak English too well. Anyway, I'd recommend to the try the food here, just a heads up that you might not receive what you've ordered for."
S D.,/user_details?userid=hB0gBYM1u29UeehcrlLkPA,"Nashville, TN",12/8/2017,3,"This restaurant is a narrow hallway opening into a nice room in the back, close to the theater district midtown, and yet quiet. The xiao long bao was meh, and some of the other assorted dim sum were passable to very good. We ordered a couple of larger dishes to share, one of which, chicken with broccoli was surprisingly good for a non-traditional Cantonese dish. The crispy beef dish was exceedingly sweet and just terrible. The service was very attentive, and the dishes came around quickly. I suspect if I ordered the right dishes, I could have a better dining experience."
Francesca L.,/user_details?userid=vZZxFIE4gXU-bg9A4ksFJQ,"Staten Island, NY",4/18/2017,4,I had a group of friends in from our of town who were staying in midtown on business and wanted Chinese food.  I was very encouraged by the reviews I read here on Yelp and I was not disappointed!  We sat at a table with a big lazy susan and ate LOTS of dim sum - which everyone enjoyed.  The place is a bit crowded & bustling but they keep the food moving and the tables turning!
Khoi M.,/user_details?userid=H_F0Max6idFR5-lfPA6n0Q,"Gilbert, AZ",3/20/2017,4,"We arrived right when they opened at 11am.  The food was good, but the service needed some attention.  We only saw our server when our food arrived."
Tabitha G.,/user_details?userid=q-Qy7VAAgw7lPQ-Dc6P5-Q,"Brooklyn, NY",11/29/2017,5,I've been here a few time for lunch and dinner.  I would recommend the shumai and shrimp dumplings.  I also like their spring rolls and coconut jello.
Jodi O.,/user_details?userid=34_1Zajp8qhMm6mER9NCAQ,"Astoria, NY",7/7/2016,5,Excellent food. Great service. Walked in at closing time and they served us immediately!

Aviva C.,/user_details?userid=Mnhu7lSSenGPPRc-DzuOXg,"Westchester County, NY",6/10/2017,2,"This is not authentic dim sum at all. Food tastes like soy sauce and not much else. As a Chinese who love dim sum, I would not come back."
Mike L.,/user_details?userid=15zNBnXrstPogxDBc7oR_g,"Fairview, TN",4/28/2017,5,Delivered in 30 minutes piping hot. Shredded duck wonton soup amazing! Not some thin corn starch broth this was stout flavor! Fried rice and chicken curry were awesome too. Ordered through Yelp delivery to hotel. Would do it again.

Hilary F.,/user_details?userid=b6D6WM_LjiUZggOFbRIMYA,"Seattle, WA",2/18/2018,4,Sad that they don't have veggie soup dumplings - really wanted to have daughter try that. She did get their veggie platter and that was good. Even ate the mushroom selection and she hates mushrooms!  Food was super hot and we both burned our tongues so watch out for that. The soup dumpling are bigger than that I'm used to on the west coast - really require two bites so you lose the joy of the soup to some extent. Staff was brusque but not rude. It's close to theatre district so they get busy but also very convenient to mid-town everything.
Michael L.,/user_details?userid=yVZbacJLSXMLo9MmK1Gbzg,"New York, NY",6/3/2017,4,Loved the food! It's good to know a nice dim sum spot around Hell's Kitchen. Service was good too. Went in the late afternoon. A family table ordered a duck off the main menu--something I would order next time.
Natalie F.,/user_details?userid=cXcYDNwZm_ed1SeN-6Qivg,"Waretown, NJ",11/17/2018,5,We LOVE this Place!!!! The food and the service are perfect and the price is even better for us. We visit here everytime we come into the city!
Brian D.,/user_details?userid=qofMzJQg33cortvCim8XBQ,"Spring, TX",11/9/2017,5,No exaggeration. Absolutely the best dim sum and sweet and sour pork we have ever had.
Romy M.,/user_details?userid=VkhHafQDeyQLh_FMr6lSWg,"Miami, FL",4/15/2017,4,Loved the noodles and shrimp sumai. We also ordered the duck egg rolls which I wasn't really a fan of. There was a piece of cartilage in it which kinda grossed me out. Our waitress was so sweet and friendly. The food couldn't have come out faster if they tried. Definitely will be returning!
Rich P.,/user_details?userid=C7xIlClL2I60Db5P-TqgKA,"Plainfield, NJ",4/15/2017,3,Food was just ok. Service was ok. Atmosphere was crowded and noisy. Place was very crowded. I would not go back.
Jen G.,/user_details?userid=BfbhqkGFGTiCKi72XRderA,"Torrance, CA",8/7/2017,5,"Probably my favorite dim sum place on the East Coast! Service was nice, the place was clean, and the food surpassed my expectations. The restaurant itself is small, but we did not have to wait at all for a table. The tea set is adorable and and my favorite dish was the pork buns! Definitely will come here again :)"
David B.,/user_details?userid=bCSch9l4MoP7z_I5QkFLtQ,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",2/4/2018,5,The Shanghai Juicy Pork Buns were probably the best I have ever tried. I would fly back from Australia just to get them.
B C.,/user_details?userid=ulwAUp-KKs1boCZzQ7shOg,"Manhattan, NY",7/8/2016,5,"Good dim sum here, have been here twice so far and it has been very fresh, more so than china town actually. The menu is smaller than China town but there's still a good amount, especially since there aren't that many dim sum places around midtown west. I have to say the dim sum is better than the entrees, tho the entrees are still good. I think it's more geared towards Americans. The people are super nice and tells you a lot about how to eat it and what is good. All around would recommend"
Christina D.,/user_details?userid=R9AP20tslegjbPRTlKjV7Q,"New Milford, NJ",7/25/2016,3,"Order soup dumpling,  pan fired noodles and shumai.  Everything was good.  I feel the food would be better if eaten in the restaurant.  Worth trying again.  Definitely going to visit their spot to try other menu items."
Melany L.,/user_details?userid=mFX8Ftj1R-MhZmW-1I42hg,"Fort Worth, TX",10/28/2017,5,The dumplings and dipping sauces were awesome. Our party of four sat down fast and the food came out quick.
Helen H.,/user_details?userid=RFp-ll4GY0uvP4__nArxHA,"Arlington, WA",7/7/2016,5,"Walked by late night while we stayed in Manhattan. Wasn't sure if it was good but most places are closed late night after 11 and I wanted something close to home. Had steamed garlic pork spareribs, shrimp dumpling with pea shoots, steamed silken tofu with shrimp stuffed and Chinese chives shrimp dumplings. My daughter and I enjoyed it very much. The dim sum tasted close to home (I originally came from canton, china). Hosts were friendly. Impressed that the restaurant were only 5 days old. Will definitely come back at lunch or dinner time to try my all time favorite dish Pea Shoot in garlic sauce (may not be in the menu but I always order it when in Chinese restaurant)"
Tim N.,/user_details?userid=izq9j5-wvjoxPDq_de8r8g,"Durham, NC",7/23/2016,5,"Awesome find in Hell's Kitchen.

Abby I.,/user_details?userid=z_3sTz_dIZgbfU-hbMTxEA,"Chicago, IL",8/22/2016,1,"I would give ZERO stars if I could. Ordered ""Kung Po Chicken"" and shrimp dumplings at 7:15pm. Food finally arrived at 8:45pm (mind you I'm starving at this point)..everything is room temp. Kung Po chicken reminded me of dog food..small diced peppers and tiny diced chicken with ZERO flavor. And I requested Spicy!! Could feed this crap to a baby - no spice."
Vicky L.,/user_details?userid=Jtc-w3RPUrH9m3l_anS74w,"New York, NY",5/9/2017,2,This restaurant is one of the reasons why Yelp is so unreliable. The food was average... not authentic Chinese food ...covered in grease... made with cheap ingredients. Chicken doesn't taste like chicken beef doesn't taste like beef. The service is horrible. We didn't order dim sum but if you are a true foodie and have been to flushing or Chinatown you know the price is ridiculous. You better be coming from a different continent to be paying 6 dollars for 3 pieces of dumpling. Enough wasting my time with this place. Like I told to people outside ....don't come here

Glenn L.,/user_details?userid=UBfO9GR2rgDWxNVHFRw-tA,"Pikesville, MD",11/12/2016,4,"This 4 month old restaurant is terrific.  They have a large menu of asian fusion foods, bit we followed the other Yelpers advice and went straight to the dim sum.  When ordering Dim Sum, you have a paper menu and a pencil.  Just check off yoir selection. Each order consists of 3 pieces.  We wanted a light snack post theater, so we ordered one order of mushroom, one shredded duck, one sesame ball with sweet bean paste.  The very hot freshly prepared mushroom and the duck ones were quite favorable,  though when hot the soft dough was sticky.  As they cooled they were less sticky. The fried sesame balls were crisp and not a bit greasy.  We'll go back when hungrier and try a larger variety"

Their dim sum is fresh and everything tasted awesome. The crabmeat and pork soup dumplings were off the chain and super flavorful. The service was great, everything came out quickly, and we had no complaints. The prices were reasonable, esp for the location, since I didn't have to trek down to chinatown or queens."

May W.,/user_details?userid=5Su3qbMQYVmCqpzLaVzYWA,"Pasadena, CA",7/19/2016,5,Opened only two weeks ago. Ken and Grace were extremely friendly and helpful. Great service and dim sum was excellent. Food came out pipping hot. Their crispy green tea rice balls (black sesame filling) was different than the traditional sesame balls with red bean paste. Will definitely look for those back in Los Angeles. Highly recommend for dim sum and will try their dinners next time I am in NYC.
Paul S.,/user_details?userid=Bk1V7YDzYjX31uNR1WQgzg,"Miami, FL",5/20/2019,4,"We were starving after a LONG play (The Ferryman) that began at 7PM and ended after 10PM so we checked Yelp and found Dim Sum Palace just around the corner.  Excellent service, clean looking and just what the doctor ordered. Order your dim sum from a plastic coated menu with the supplied dry-erase marker and enjoyed the Har Gow, Sui Mai, Sticky Rice and soup dumplings with a couple of Tsing Taos and left very happy."
Brian D.,/user_details?userid=PDO69G_sc-ivkIFaDAim0w,"Sterling, VA",5/16/2019,4,"Not a lot of Dim Sum restaurants around anymore. The palace was classic, wonderful selection , fair pricing. Great for lunch or dinner. Nice selection of tea and some unique dishes."
Ayaka O.,/user_details?userid=iuf87yfnwjeSKBI6_RtJkQ,"İstanbul, Turkey",8/16/2019,4,Everything was tasty and served quickly. Too bad that they don't have mango puddings.
Raquel S.,/user_details?userid=hKrwQx4oIHWOqX_B68grhQ,"New York, NY",4/8/2017,5,"I love that this place has all my favorite things! You HAVE to try the soy beans dumplings, it's out of this world flavored!"
Vera G.,/user_details?userid=rVXBPNXjvMjg9RA-w1Ha1A,"Phoenix, AZ",6/17/2017,5,"This place was a perfect place for our first meal in NYC.   We ordered some congee, dim sum and dumplings which were all delicious.  The atmosphere was fun and lively, my daughter made the comment that she felt like we were in someone's kitchen with all the conversations that were going on. We would definitely visit again."
Hui Z.,/user_details?userid=c11ET3estWzwrv7xprN0ZA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/15/2017,3,"I ordered beef chow fun with spicy sour soup and chicken feet. Beef chow fun was so so so oily! And the chef didn't even put an salt! YES, NO SALT! The soup and chicken feet was okay."
Rob H.,/user_details?userid=Stqeq1j6baJJV0ABbWXypw,"Manhattan, NY",2/21/2017,2,"Disgustingly sweet sauces.  Even for stuff that's not General Tso's or whatever where you might expect it, you'll get it with other dishes too.  For example their spicy crispy beef - drenched in sickly sweet sugar syrup, not at all spicy."
Christopher T.,/user_details?userid=vIaRvs0GSNYr2v2PnGZk0A,"Hammond, LA",9/14/2017,4,"Not a big fan of Chinese food, but my daughter insisted we come here. The food was awesome. I would highly recommend this place. I would come here again."
Tiffany K.,/user_details?userid=JWHf0K97zQvAjf1x87RyQA,"Brooklyn, NY",7/21/2016,5,I came to this new restaurant with my family around noon and we got the lunch special and some dimsum. The staff here is great and the food is tasty! My family and I enjoyed our time at Dim Sum Palace!!
Cynthia G.,/user_details?userid=kXVREw60WuhWLAPMrp0jRw,"San Francisco, CA",7/24/2016,5,"One word... ADDICTIVE!!  We started out out ordering only a few items and couldn't stop ourselves! Plain and simple... Fresh, delicious, great service!! Tried new things that were not only pleasant but now I will order everytime! I recommend this to dimsum newbies and veterans. Ten thumbs up! You will not be disappointed!"
T H.,/user_details?userid=BpnkKSZBeJeTWjEMQx4Rww,"Manteca, CA",7/24/2016,5,Great food and open late. Hospitality is excellent! A great spot to eat off the hustle and bustle of Time Square. Two thumbs way up!
Laura C.,/user_details?userid=pMG61cSi8GZd-aYhgmPY-w,"Barrie, Canada",6/24/2019,5,"Awesome food, great prices and friendly and efficient staff! We will definitely be returning to this restaurant!"
Paul L.,/user_details?userid=CGTmBp55LJxuaQRukAF8TA,"Hackensack, NJ",6/13/2017,5,Very friendly staff and the food was amazing. Hard to find good dimsum in the neighborhood and this place defintely deserves all of the praises it's getting.
Amit L.,/user_details?userid=ihzrXXwdzUngf2wgoNG7XA,"New York, NY",7/27/2016,5,Excellent dimsums - best option in midtown so far.
Tom F.,/user_details?userid=88AEpQNqAoUhc7-kVt7ZdQ,"New York, NY",2/16/2017,4,"Friendly service, very good quality dim sum. As good as most of the dim sum places I've been to in Chinatown."
Ellision E.,/user_details?userid=vNk62h6wQ8obLxYQSiCqqw,"Dayton, OH",10/30/2016,5,"We had some really great takeout but it was easy to tell the atmosphere here was relaxed and welcoming, too."
Erin C.,/user_details?userid=g5ZqRHC1GuWhK4QmxTeBIQ,"San Marcos, CA",2/14/2017,2,"My husband and I came here because of all the positive feedback this restaurant had gotten. First off, the dim sum was really good. Particularly the shanghai pork bun dumplings. (If that's not the name, it's something very similar!) After the dim sum though, the meal went south really quick. We ordered the crispy ginger chicken, and I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. It just did not look appetizing at all. But my husband ate it, he enjoyed it in the moment until we got home and he spent the night in the bathroom throwing up. Needless to say, we won't be back. Even if I wanted some dim sum, I don't think I could get my husband's stomach back in that restaurant. Really unfortunate."
Ann W.,/user_details?userid=hoHyM4L-6lhG0wHWJqLc8w,"San Francisco, CA",2/13/2017,3,"Decent menu. Staff was accommodating when it was close to closing. not every item was good. For example, the XLBs had a weird soy sauce juice with it. Made it less desirable to finish the rest.  I only enjoyed the chicken dumpling. The siu Mai tasted fresh but not the best. Decent pricing."
BeTheBuddha W.,/user_details?userid=6blQRipGOuvdjM9ZBAPuwg,"West Hills, CA",8/25/2016,3,"Not a bad place if you're craving some dimsum and you're stuck in Times Square. They have a happy hour with half off dim sum and drinks between 3-6pm (not sure if that's everyday or M-F). I had the black bean spareribs (one of my faves) and it came out nice and hot. Enjoyed that. The cold sesame noodles were a little too sweet for my tasted and not enough sesame. I make it better. House fried chicken wings were a little greasy and bland (even with the accoutrements) for my taste - I would pass on those next time. Waiter forgot my hot & sour soup, but I was full anyway from the xiao long bao and other stuff. Skin on the xiao long bao could have been thinner, but otherwise not bad. A little pricy than most dim sum places but that seems to be the norm in Times Square. I would go again."
Dan P.,/user_details?userid=kqQe7V2J49LuWp4RfqajcQ,"Houston, TX",6/7/2017,5,Wow. I'm not that positive about Chinese restaurants in NYC but this was a pleasant surprise! Dim sum was good and the crispy chicken was amazing. Great choice for a casual drop in.
Tianyi Y.,/user_details?userid=son7DteoQaVeBHnmrQ5QDQ,"Evanston, IL",3/27/2019,4,"Very authentic Din sum place - however, they would charge for tea for around 10 dollars. Be aware when you order tea if you l, like me, thought they'd be free like all other places"

Lind N.,/user_details?userid=3WZ_91Mlwrv-iY5kcFVhow,"Irvine, CA",5/31/2017,5,Best.Dim.Sum.EVER. I moved here from So Cal where there's a dim sum in every corner in Westminster. Nothing compares to this place. Quality matches the price tag. There are definitely cheaper options in the area but you get what you pay for. Give this place a shot during their happy hour if you're concerned about the price. No regrets.
Bradley S.,/user_details?userid=U0WI4gAgXdeBAeAZtkfRWA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/31/2019,5,"Amazing restaurant, amazing food. Wholesome. Noodles are so fresh, everything is clean on the pallet. Awesome"
Stephanie C.,/user_details?userid=LXOyHKvF5lfmRWXgvubKHA,"Inwood, Manhattan, NY",9/2/2016,2,"Given that Ive been in search of good dim sum( that is not in Flushing), I had high hopes when I saw how highly rated this new place was! My partner and I tried several items on their dim sum menu and were disappointed by all of them.  Also, the dim sum selection is limited and has very few of the traditional dim sum offerings (with non-traditional dim sum prices). The one plus was that the service was attentive and warm."
Jeffery H.,/user_details?userid=OXv1bWobBIrQOyIENp-rbw,"San Diego, CA",6/16/2019,5,Great food decent prices with an awesome and attentive staff. I cane here because of the yelp reviews and was happy I did.
Renai F.,/user_details?userid=AYvUErT-h_ee93zp3sax-g,"Queens, NY",5/27/2017,5,Came here with a friend who was visiting NYC. Quick service and the food was great. Can't beat a hot and traditional dim sum with a pretty good selection. Pretty close to Times Square and apparently they deliver. Also the hot and sour soup was amazing!
Jonathan A.,/user_details?userid=qIY-dE3MisWMRxWdL1CTXA,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",1/4/2017,5,Great dim sum and very good service.  Not much to say but will eat the next time I'm in NYC.
Paul M.,/user_details?userid=yGZ3QLiz0F1eOx0cSwatgQ,"New York, NY",12/6/2016,5,"Wow, better than dim sum in Queens or Chinatown that Chinese co-workers and friends have taken me to.  Fried options were not greasy compared to other places so the dipping sauces ( ginger or red pepper in oil) were complementary instead of grease on grease."
Sam S.,/user_details?userid=90fn5n3MC1UG4SMBWHsb1w,"Los Angeles, CA",9/10/2016,5,Verry good fresh made to order style dim sum! Happy hour is 50% off.... Can't beat that. Eaten here 3 times this week;)
Stephanie M.,/user_details?userid=ya3ugtzDovcauWRwwOqYVg,"San Jose, CA",3/9/2017,5,Literally some of the best dim sum I have ever had - pretty tough to beat since I live near San Francisco with some great dim sum! Everything we ordered was absolutely amazing and cooked to perfection. Also a great location being close to Times Square but away from the crowds. Love this place!
Sharon D.,/user_details?userid=n5tXhrKVaFPAtWOckrv4OA,"Bronx, NY",8/14/2016,5,Loved everything we tried. I especially liked the green balls for dessert. They were filled with chocolate and peanuts. Sorry I can't remember the name. Will be back. Glad we stopped in after a show.
Rob C.,/user_details?userid=kS1MQHYwIfD0462PE61IBw,"Palo Alto, CA",3/2/2018,5,"solid.  lots of dumpling choices.  fast, not the most delicate prep, but strong for the area."
Mathew T.,/user_details?userid=LbcC9GAUpPMJSUfmbgb5xg,"Manhattan, NY",7/28/2016,5,So this is the best Chinese Resturaunt in Hell's Kitchen. I've lived in HK for over 12 years and Finally we have a good one! The pork soup dumplings are awesome and their Peking duck is off the charts! Enjoy enjoy enjoy
Allan D.,/user_details?userid=1sAL5Y2K6_PjG34ZFStd6w,"FL, FL",8/15/2017,5,"while out to watch a broadway play with my sister and mom, i had to look for a restaurant that serves asian cuisine.  chose dimsum palace as it was close to the theater we plan to watch.  fortunate to have been seated immediately as the place was quite full at 11 am on an wednesday.  dimsum was similar to those served in chinatown.  everything was delicious except for the xiao long bao which did not appear newly cooked but just reheated.  aside from that, the place and service were amazing."
Cammie A.,/user_details?userid=XM1p0j90c6lD1-j-8c-aNA,"Newton, NC",8/13/2017,5,"Amazing place for dim sum! Great, quaint atmosphere, very friendly and everything tasted amazing. Don't miss this treasure!"
Ally S.,/user_details?userid=nZqcH75NFzY35v9yAqMf7A,"Southampton, NY",1/19/2017,4,"Good Dim Sum! Anything with duck is really good, I would stick to the Dim Sum menu."
Betty Y.,/user_details?userid=2UUFjC8uaRCWt-mW6Z5Xeg,"Boston, MA",12/22/2016,4,I was craving dim sum but didn't want to travel to Chinatown since I was staying in Hells Kitchen. Found this place through a google search. The food was great and he service was good. It is however made to order so there are no carts. They also didn't carry the shrimp or beef rice noodle tools which are my favorites. The shrimp dumplings were Bomb and made in house. They're also open til 2am which is great since there's only pizza late night in that area. I only gave it four stars for the lack of the rice noodles which is a staple of dim sum.
Brandon F.,/user_details?userid=W2rF0VZ6kkk0GSjL4Va7Kw,"San Francisco, CA",5/12/2017,5,This place is my go to pre Broadway stop! They are the greatest dim sum I've ever had.
Mingyang L.,/user_details?userid=TOvdg5IkM7HbA7Y9sQnbag,"New York, NY",8/5/2016,5,"Very nice place and super friendly owner. Like the dim sum most. First time came here, and very impressed."

Arleen T.,/user_details?userid=MvqPI_gMEKfFxDV7xhvMnw,"Stafford, VA",8/6/2017,5,"We took our daughter on a day trip to New York for her birthday and found this place on Yelp. We're always unsure of where to eat in NYC since there are so many choices and it seems that most restaurants are very crowded. We walked in and no line but we had to wait for a few minutes for a table. No waiting area, really. But we were seated pretty quickly. The dim sum we ordered was brought out as soon as it was cooked. Everything we ordered was hot and delicious.  The green balls (can't remember the name) were beyond delicious!  Try them!  The prices were very reasonable and we all left full after a very tasty lunch. Would definitely go back!"
Billy T.,/user_details?userid=kbsfTfj-3wM6wODonIWi3Q,"Brooklyn, NY",7/18/2016,5,"My friend and I were going to a concert at BB Kings later that evening and were looking for a place to eat ahead of time. We walked up and down Restaurant Row and came across this place. I'm so glad that we decided to dine here because everything turned out to be great. They serve dim sum all day long, and have a Happy Hour from 4-7 pm, where everything is half price. I had a cocktail that was very good, and several dim sum choices that were absolutely delicious. I ordered several dishes and wish I'd ordered a couple of more...lol. The service was very good. I had forgotten my reading glasses, and one of the waiters was kind enough to lend me his, which did the trick. The atmosphere was fine, but the tasty food was the best part. Also, the prices were more than reasonable considering the location. i can't wait to go back there again. I highly recommend this gem of a place!!!"
Peter C.,/user_details?userid=xeHSqyzZWXuVwQMDKJA_4w,"Sherman Oaks, CA",7/29/2017,5,Total Gem--who knew you could get great DimSum without going to Chinatown.   Highly recommended and a bargain to boot.
G M.,/user_details?userid=gL2FPngGEC5E-4c1RZlq6A,"Riverview, FL",2/9/2017,5,Food was great and service! Happy hour till 6pm. Drinks are great too but a little pricey.
Camille L.,/user_details?userid=bVsyYSdPB6XRJP2Nqq3pwA,"Los Angeles, CA",5/27/2019,4,"We got our classic juicy pork dumplings, pork bao and vegetables lo-mein. Everything was good. I'm taking one five star out because the service was just okay and I noticed that the place wasn't overall super clean. Good for a quick late bite after a show!"
Rye Bread C.,/user_details?userid=rfetHPklMQZ4fOZwR0mXZg,"Washington, DC",4/17/2017,4,"Really tasty place. We ordered multiple dim sum from their lunch special. I loved their coconut cake dessert. My favorite one was the lotus leaf with sticky rice, it was quite tasty. The service was pretty good and fast, everything came out hot and was exquisite. I would definitely recommend."
Xuecheng L.,/user_details?userid=4mXsQoeyygh8jJvv5vOteg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/15/2017,2,Food is good. But Horribly Rude Delivery People With Bad Attitude!
Jeffrey W.,/user_details?userid=oeVbkOqio781LvS7x-jrBA,"Manhattan, NY",9/6/2016,5,We absolutely loved this place. It's great that we don't have to go all the way down to Chinatown to have amazing Dim Sum. The scallion pancake is delicious and the pork and crab dumplings are little dough wrapped packets of heaven!
Yue L.,/user_details?userid=o1XPzcEG-0ulF9KxTaQqkQ,"Northfield, MN",12/18/2016,4,"They offer half price dim sum and drinks before six weekdays. I tried the shrimp dumpling, pork ribs, chicken feet, porridge, and shrimp shumai. My favorite is the shrimp dumpling."
Holly R.,/user_details?userid=_G7gTbxdNk1DiKsZAmRJbA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/12/2017,3,"I was expecting Chinatown-level quality because of all these great reviews BUT this place did not live up. I was disappointed. An overall issue was that the dough of the dim sum was just too sticky, like we couldn't get it off our chop sticks.. and I must say that I wasn't really enthused about any of the fillings either. The fried things we ordered were good like veg spring rolls and scallion pancakes- but who can't make fried things? I really came for the dim sum and was not happy with it. Probably won't come back. And luckily we happened to stumble in at around 3:30 so it was 50% off (from 3-5 I think). Otherwise it would've been grossly overpriced for what it was."
Val L.,/user_details?userid=oJYCS3-z1o6ReOaMnYaXMg,"Denton, TX",7/16/2016,5,"The service is soooo good that I already want to give 5 stars. After the dishes came out, it's totally mind-blowing!

Claude S.,/user_details?userid=48UQl8Mrym6sVlWNFEkVeg,"Hudson, OH",10/8/2017,4,"Fast and delicious soup dumplings. We wanted to try something new and cheap on our last night in NYC. This really hit the spot. First time having soup dumplings so I won't weigh in on the comparative quality, but they were delicious."
Gia L.,/user_details?userid=m52F9aYFGJts6aCEapHWww,"Upland, CA",8/1/2016,5,SO GOOD!  Had the honey walnut shrimp and shrimp dumplings (i was in the mood for shrimp...don't judge).  IT was delicious.  Perfectly plump huge shrimp and amazing flavor.  The dumplings were also little packages of heaven.  Fast delivery as well.  Highly recommend.
Rob D.,/user_details?userid=QDofgVgsmaV5yERuKPhonA,"Wailuku, HI",10/14/2016,4,Nice ambiance. Food was good. We went here after a musical. We didn't order dim sum. The crispy pork ribs were deep fried bits with the bone still in. They were ok but the bone part was off putting. The walnut shrimp was delicious as was the lo mein. We also had general tso chicken one of my faves. I liked it enough but it was crispy and the sauce was just ok. Service was awkward to say the least. They were very friendly but not quite skilled. The specialty cocktails were not good. They serve an Asian mule but it was very lemony and they use ginger ale instead of ginger beer. The regular mixed drinks were good though. The bartender did come over to check on how we liked the mule and offered to replace it. That was very kind.
Eugene H.,/user_details?userid=FldV0ybTfDwnv6brBsgFOw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/30/2019,5,Best DimSum place and I've been to plenty. Food is top notch. Great service. Amazing bathrooms. Variety of food and a great place to have dinner at.
Angel T.,/user_details?userid=T3AZSC5tv89Nbsg1_cijbQ,"Pittsburgh, PA",6/30/2019,1,"The service was AWFUL. They got our drinks wrong, would not explain the menu until we asked a 3rd time. Took the food that we paid for to the back and box everything up, only to not give us 1/3 of it back. All around it was a bad experience. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone."
Jackie L.,/user_details?userid=pyLxHQR4xqdSD2qAZaKglw,"Seattle, WA",1/8/2019,5,This place really tastes like Cantonese dim sum and food. Every dim sum dish and even the sauces and salted fish/chicken bit fried rice tasted legit.
Frankie N.,/user_details?userid=eOtgnxfScNBYEGnr_9cGdA,"Buena Park, CA",1/7/2017,5,I had a craving for dim sum. As a first time visitor in New York I had expected the prices would be a little steep since it's the only local dim sum place in Times Square. I decided to walk over during a snow storm and was very surprised how fast my to go order was. The hostess taking my order was friendly and waved me to the bar for a cup of green tea while my order was being prepared. Food was very good and will come back for future visits If I don't feel like taking a subway to Chinatown.
Kirsten T.,/user_details?userid=MhZRGA_lFAAGVSbfXgs-rg,"Edgewood, Washington, DC",6/17/2017,4,Food was really delicious service was good and they have an extensive bar. I'd definitely go back.

Christina B.,/user_details?userid=cLyj-54sxylWZtsdSa0fQg,"Visalia, CA",6/12/2017,5,This place was amazingly delicious. I wish I was staying longer so I could go back again. Loved their pork pan fried noodles and shrimp dim sum. Definitely try this place of your looking for great Chinese food!
Sheryl L.,/user_details?userid=fL0jIsxSR2DSBeIRI8OcTA,"Oakton, VA",3/12/2017,5,"A bunch of my friends and I went to this place because we were craving dim sum in the area. I had originally intended to get the normal fare, but I saw that a lady behind me had a plate of delicious-looking pan fried noodles, so I knew I had to order that instead! I got the noodles with pork on top, which was a very wise decision. My friends and I agreed that the char siu tasted absolutely amazing, and the noodles themselves were also a nice thickness. The restaurant was a little pricy, but that is to be expected in Times Square. It was a little awkward when we paid because the waiter came back and asked if we had forgotten to tip because we left the line blank -- we were intending to tip with cash. Overall, the food was really tasty here, and I would come back for more of the char siu!"
Robert M.,/user_details?userid=AAs-lyQEe2A8uupk6Ky-rQ,"Albuquerque, NM",6/11/2017,5,Wow this place meet all expectations.  The food was amazing and was well worth the little money spent. This place must be the friendliest place in manhattan because everyone had a smile on their face!  Great service and dim sum. Go check them out!
Annie L.,/user_details?userid=qejIvhZGF0ssWRVDSvwMKA,"Manhattan, NY",7/18/2016,5,"This area has been needing a dim sum restaurant for years and I am thrilled that they finally have a good one in the form of Dim Sum Palace! The dumplings are freshly made and did not disappoint! I got the seafood and pea shoot dumplings and mixed mushroom dumplings- so delicious that I can't wait to go back and try the others. Also got the BBQ beef buns, sticky rice in lotus leaf, and soft shell crab appetizer. The buns and crab were delicious, but my only slight criticism would be that the sticky rice's flavor could be improved...it tasted fine with the other items but this is usually one of my go-to dim sum items that I order by itself and thought it would taste more tea-smoked and have a few more interesting things in the filling to give more flavor. All in all however, this is a wonderful spot to have dim sum in without having to make the trek to Chinatown- and certainly more clean and pleasant."

Rena H.,/user_details?userid=bK4Y_GZUoAUTXIrmeEUGYw,"New York, NY",12/22/2016,2,"OK, so I ordered a take out, steam dumplings and veges and pork chops.

Andi C.,/user_details?userid=KcMPEdAzxB-VMVbLanGFhQ,"New York, NY",5/31/2017,5,"With so many great options in NY this is still one of my absolute favorites for the fresh AUTHENTIC cuisine.

Tourists and locals alike, this is worth it!!"
L L.,/user_details?userid=zT4Y0t8Tw6XBI4DpGT8Tsg,"Vienna, VA",9/11/2016,4,Very chunky and tasty siu mai. A little sticky har gau. Small but tasty beef cow fun. Everything as expected. Solid and delicious but not spectacular.
Mike G.,/user_details?userid=Atio667BQDb3iXkXSQMeCg,"Westwood, NJ",12/17/2016,5,Great food - fast service. I had the Dim Sum appy - Only problem with it is there was only 4 - Could of ate another dozen or so. The Chow Fun was excellent. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the pork was tender and moist. Can't wait to order again!
Nidhi A.,/user_details?userid=bCKxeW_KdqHHXUUJOHT-Rg,"Boston, MA",2/25/2017,4,Absolutely great dimsums made to order so they are steaming fresh !
Elaine C.,/user_details?userid=B4UR-JmoShtK5_EdwpMEqw,"San Jose, CA",8/29/2017,5,I would highly recommend the Pineapple Cheese Wonton and Sweet Egg Yolk Creamy Bun. It's just awesome! The service is fantastic also. The staffs are always polite and friendly. I like this place and I will definitely come back.
Ivy L.,/user_details?userid=uA2haFiAdEzQOtl_ewv1LA,"Brooklyn, NY",8/28/2017,5,I have been there a couple of times. The service there is very good as well as the food. I look forward to going there again in the future.
Gina F.,/user_details?userid=QaXIEXpLbSGnwvXyNEJ7tA,"Upper Montclair, Montclair, NJ",6/14/2019,5,"First of all, they're very clean and have very good customer service.  Second of all, the pork buns were great and the honey ginger chicken was outstanding.  Also, this place is vegetarian friendly.  When you order dessert here, I suggest you the crispy milk.  I'm definitely coming back soon."
Steve V.,/user_details?userid=xji9qYUOx4GBh04avLgRtw,"Riverside, CA",2/17/2017,4,Great late night service. Dishes were hot and tasty.  I really enjoyed the crabmeat juicy pork bun.
Marizel B.,/user_details?userid=VVETBNLGkYD9D-pzunF0Sw,"Great Mills, MD",8/13/2017,4,"My first time in New York City for work. I ordered online have it delivered to my hotel. Delivery was fast, food was good. Dim sum highly recommended."
Rico I.,/user_details?userid=HEPrkKU49mePo8ZmYvO4Yw,"New York, NY",11/26/2016,5,"Holy cow this place is delish. the pork buns, singapore noodles, the dim sum, likely the best chinese food i have ever had. Seriously, get down here, order online, make the pilgrimage, you will not regret this cullinary delight!"
Rasheed G.,/user_details?userid=5bHi3JewXhom9HEbyKrGBw,"New York, NY",2/3/2017,5,I order the shrimp dumplings to go and they were very freshly made and very delicious !

You check what you want off a paper menu, i loved the dumplings, the meat was juicy and tender. Definitely, recommend this place!"

Erwin S.,/user_details?userid=_zg5naNUVZ3Qq2E_MnW2XA,"Canton, OH",11/20/2016,4,Excellent dim sum overall. Small place so they do it made to order... No carts. Har gow was very good. Large amount of shrimp and piping hot. Sesame balls were also nice and hot. Busy place but service was a little slow. They do have a decent assortment but not as much as a full size dim sum place. Overall an excellent lunch.
Deborah N.,/user_details?userid=NfiA_mb_amxVG0y2KRIDcA,"San Antonio, TX",10/7/2016,4,"This place is a hidden gem. We came to NYC originally for brunch  and had a change of heart. The dim sum here is delish, happy hour is the best!"
Greg F.,/user_details?userid=nWsNSlYkrh_izY1TWprPXg,"New York, NY",10/6/2016,1,Mediocre food and absolutely horrible service. Had a full hour wait for food. Not due to a packed restaurant but just simple incompetence. Definitely not worth it.
Minori C.,/user_details?userid=UsIXface_QUkc58rS5r_Kg,"Washington, DC",1/28/2017,5,They really hand make their food - no frozen dumplings. Everything on the menu was great. Delicious!
Alicia E.,/user_details?userid=1Uxl2HZT1MoRUxYzSXmACw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/30/2019,5,So good authentic Dim sum in a easily accessible atmosphere.  This was my sons first time at a real Dim Sum restaurant and they did not make us feel out of place. The service was over the top helpful and welcoming. Even when I had a chopstick accident and spilled my wine they still went over the to help me. The food was so good!!
Boone R.,/user_details?userid=9kyjIRlARP7UPRgz2DbPZQ,"Denver, CO",7/31/2017,5,"Excellent dim sum and open till 1:30 a.m., right by Times Square where there is not always the best selection of food available. This place is totally clutch."
Rick H.,/user_details?userid=Ps1IiRrN_74FQR9X8fKMEA,"Erie, PA",7/29/2017,3,The food was good. The menu could use more detail of what is in the dish. The sweet and sour chicken already had the sauce on it. My 10 year old was not happy. My wife got the veg/seafood pan fried noodles they were good but she was a bit thrown off with the squid on them (not a fan) but no description on menu. I got some pork and shrimp offerings from their dim sum menu and they were delicious.
Holly G.,/user_details?userid=Hy5lT-A9ulVgA20rZyqnEQ,"Chicago, IL",9/30/2016,2,The food was amazing but service was extremely slow. 30 min for dim sum. Not a place to go for a work lunch.

Shirley W.,/user_details?userid=2cpv_C36G9Z6x8wWpjfM6A,"Watertown Town, MA",4/10/2017,4,Pretty good for a dim sum place in the heart of Manhattan. 流沙包 is particularly good. The three of us finished nine of them! Slightly pricy comparison no to Flushing though!
Samm S.,/user_details?userid=EshPC4eTgd2bYuE-TXCUDQ,"Dallas, TX",4/9/2017,5,"Wow! Such an amazing find! True, authentic food that was to die for! BBQ pork buns and veggie spring rolls were out of this world! Highly highly recommended!!"
Hung C.,/user_details?userid=JlxevFxTpfMYP2ADlgaxuw,"Jefferson, VA",4/9/2017,4,They dim sum was good and restaurant is clean. It's a good spot to get the dim sum fixed outside of Chinatown and being in the time square area.
Simon L.,/user_details?userid=630haZMnbx06aig0uTWuiw,"Brooklyn, NY",1/3/2017,5,I came in with family friends from hong kong and they said its just like the dim sum they have at home. The service was friendly and it was super close to home. Id reccommend everyone to come
J S.,/user_details?userid=Z92KyRk-O1LFfSSXcQA8wg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/6/2017,5,I'd love this restaurant the service is amazing they treat you like a superstar and the food is so delicious dim sum You must try the jumbo shrimp with honey walnuts Delicious and the Peking Duck  u going to go Wow wend u try this dish .I want to specially thank the owner and manager Kevin for great service thank you .
Barry W.,/user_details?userid=FRNMW2P3323sTv-nKaW_1Q,"Greenwood, IN",3/27/2019,2,"General TSO's Chicken was good, Mongolian Beef and Wontons were also good. Service was very helpful. My one caveat is that I was very ill, later in the evening, after eating here. I don't know if the food here was the cause or not. Everything seemed fresh. The only thing I specifically ate that no one else did, was the Mongolian beef."
Brandi C.,/user_details?userid=hwA8n5FeRlZ_KdruH0SgKw,"Gainesville, FL",3/26/2017,4,"Seated immediately on a Sunday night and very attentive service. Juicy pork dumplings, string beans, fried pork dumplings and fried ribs were so tasty! Nice find."

Lily S.,/user_details?userid=mc41AbOL3mf1TTcYMEPI3w,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",10/29/2017,1,DO NOT GO HERE! I live in the area so my friend from China and I decided to get some dim sum here instead of Chinatown. We saw that there was a happy hour on dim sum at 3PM so we walked in at 2:54pm. The food was not that authentic and tasted as if it was from the day before. They did not honor the happy hour prices because of 6 minutes. Food is not good so just go to Chinatown or Flushing instead
Donna M.,/user_details?userid=UCf5K0GRcHnhFs2Tf2q-dw,"Pulteney, NY",3/18/2017,5,Great post show dining option. Everything we ate was just right. My ONLY complaint was they v sold out of pineapple cream cheese wonton.
R W.,/user_details?userid=ffNk0S6hBURLHeeaepbmBw,"Manhattan, NY",8/23/2016,4,"Talk about friendly service!! Top notch! The food is super fresh and this is such an awesome neighborhood addition without going to Chinatown. You don't get all the variety of dim sum to choose from, but they have all the staples. The dumplings and pork buns are super fresh, hot and yummy! The prices are definitely higher, but hey, you're not in Chinatown! It was about $50 for 2 people and we got s veggie dish to share and about 5 dim sum baskets. Will be coming back!"
Sumin Angie K.,/user_details?userid=ITzPfX7klSJTqrTKQrsBlw,"Brooklyn, NY",12/11/2018,2,"I ordered lunch special. The order came wrong and the pork was soggy and cold, the soup lid was not closed properly..."
Sandra L.,/user_details?userid=IUNBzt_YUThRwXL-dCRUFQ,"Waltham, MA",8/17/2016,5,Service here is absolutely unbeatable! Food is okay. The sitting area down the hallway is a little bit crowded.
Danielle S.,/user_details?userid=kD_RAt6BJ92xvMsvsJoC6Q,"Deer Park, NY",12/7/2018,5,"I've been coming here since 2016 . I love this place ! They now have 3 restaurants , Best yellow dragon drink made of tequila . . The Dim sum is authentic . Price is great and setting is cozy . I had such a nice experience here . Desserts are delicious . Sesame ball and pineapple cheese are both delicious. I happen to read a review by phi .. I guess he just wasn't in the mood for the real deal dim sum . dim sum palace you deserve a five star from me .   Thank you dim sum palace you are my go to place in midtown . Good luck on Number 3 restaurant!"
Arthur M. K.,/user_details?userid=23mUvv0YG8QFFRWvgk6WsQ,"NJ, NJ",12/5/2016,5,"Authentic, best I ever had, a hole in the wall. Tea best also I would come back. Their dim sum is a cut above. Place is so so , great service and friendly staff."
Billy S.,/user_details?userid=MeWvymmeMB7FIFWymNeXIw,"Ramsey, NJ",9/24/2016,1,Was expecting to be a push cart dim sum but it's a regular American  microwave made to order dim sum prices were above average price for NY
Jeff G.,/user_details?userid=vH92uRJSde-WY-S2s17nsQ,"Falls Church, VA",12/1/2016,5,"Wife and I went a couple days before Thanksgiving.

Helen O.,/user_details?userid=YCA90twJ5OJWqP0_bC7NeQ,"Manhattan, NY",8/8/2016,5,"Great food delicious dimsum. Wish there was more selection (i.e. Haw churn, egg tart, turnip cake). We ordered Shrimp dumplings, shumai, pork and chive dumplings, sautéed mixed vegetable (had a delicious sauce so we ordered a second serving). Soup dumplings were OKAY. Fried rice was tasty. Great service. Also, we had a reservation for 6 people at 12:00pm. They were accommodating and the restaurant filled up quickly right after. I'd recommend making reservations or arriving before Noon."

Always satisfies my dumpling cravings and the food comes out very quickly. I can't wait until I find myself around Times Square again so that I can go back here. Open late so perfect to go to after seeing a show.
Grisell Ariana R.,/user_details?userid=MGPdIOoYM4L1L1MP31aFuw,"Commerce, CA",11/21/2016,5,"Excellent Service, Clean and Spacious Space, Extremely Clean Bathroom . 1/2 dim sum And drinks = Awesome .

A L.,/user_details?userid=wfqWG9uus7x-bDcDIijCmQ,"Miller Place, NY",11/13/2016,5,Great place for Dim Sum. Went in for lunch and was greeted right away. They give u a menu to check off what dishes you would like. Everything we had was great. Can't wait to bring friends back with us.
Vincent S.,/user_details?userid=UvmvgyfZ_Dc_XOlm_9mueA,"Philadelphia, PA",2/12/2017,3,It's a nice little place with some good food. Definitely not 5 star quality. Price is a bit high but it's New York.
Knice Da Maje Y.,/user_details?userid=o9QHCiEr05Lmq7WnpZxFGw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7/11/2017,5,The Food here is EXCELLENT! The place is awesome and the staff provide stellar service. I work with celebrity clients at Platinum Sound Recording Studios and our clients are always satisfied. I refer this restaurant to guarantee the positive experience our clients need.
Nina S.,/user_details?userid=uWiLC1XD9cMx_9i9KwoY8A,"Atlanta, GA",2/8/2017,5,We weren't sure what to expect but this place was amazing and very clean which is a plus!  The rice was fresh and full of vegetables. They had a cream cheese and pineapple Rangoon instead of crab and it was spectacular. They make their own homemade soy sauce which I could possible drink it was so good. Would definitely go again.
Andrea H.,/user_details?userid=24p4PNjALw9hfo4K_DTHZw,"Lake Zurich, IL",2/6/2017,5,"We had lunch here and it was delicious! The lunch special is a great value with soup, rice, and entree for $9.95. We had the Pepper steak (wonderfully tender beef with tons of peppers) and General Tso's chicken (yummy sweet sauce that wasn't too spicy, very good quality chicken - no fat, and broccoli on the side). We both would definitely eat here again! The decor is beautiful, and chairs comfy. A short walk from Times Square."
Beiqian X.,/user_details?userid=GTRXHzJ6Nvo1BNlpSRCwyQ,"West Lafayette, IN",5/12/2017,2,"Food was good, but a bit pricey, so I gave 10% tip, and then was educated, kinda forced into paying up to 15% tip, and it turned our experience into a bad one."
Wendy L.,/user_details?userid=UeiNCl0HrCLknuTMsS0OZA,"Irvine, CA",8/21/2016,5,"VERY GOOD DIMSUM IN MIDTOWN! I think it's comparable to dimsum at chinatown. Very lucky to find this place so I don't have to go all the way to chinatown anymore! The food is delicious, we got shrimp dumpling, shumai, lotus leaf, xiao long bao, fried taro cake. Everything taste good but the the frind taro cake is exceptionally good so I would recommend to try that! The price is good too and I heard they have happy hour for dimsum so we probably going to come back for that!"
Coco G.,/user_details?userid=cRHR6glpwKI93bnSlszrgw,"New York, NY",10/29/2018,4,Just so glad to get a good dim sum without having to go all the way down to Chinatown.
Liangci X.,/user_details?userid=raLPtiCHnc5Ag2ZS9-k_XQ,"Downtown, Atlanta, GA",10/28/2016,4,This place looks really good and their Dim Sim tastes really good. I really like the pork rib.
Chen L.,/user_details?userid=8T7kA7FLOzt9ugGYwTbTCQ,"West Lafayette, IN",1/20/2017,5,"Tamago and salmon are good, tuna is a little bit hard. Have a musician performance on Friday night, amazing music. Fine Chinese and Japanese restaurant."
Xiaojun Y.,/user_details?userid=db_R8RpGLFhDBcgNe6MMNA,"Palisades, NY",10/20/2018,2,"We came to this place for dim sum on Saturday October 20,2018 based on yelp rating. We ordered many different dumplings, chicken feet, stuffed tofu, and steamed buns. We were disappointed by the quality of the food. Some dumplings were tasted like streamed from frozen food, instead of freshly made at the restaurant. The stuffed tofu was particularly not fresh. The $8 pot of tea did not taste like TieGuanYin we expected. However, the service was good. The place was full at the lunch time. The food came out promptly and empty plates were taken away quickly. Next time we will go to Chinatown for high quality dim sum."
Cindy L.,/user_details?userid=oBeCVCyeFm-h9qMUQ_spTw,"Tampa Bay, FL",1/12/2019,2,"We didn't mind the wait to get a table, but the service for a dim sum place was awfully slow. The portion sizes are far from reasonable. Everything tasted fine, but you can get the same quality food for literally half the price of this place. If you want great dim sum for a good price, I recommend going elsewhere."
Jill D.,/user_details?userid=K38AEzQpuV2B9X3FKR4PDQ,"Henrico, VA",1/2/2017,4,The food was wonderful and it was inexpensive for NY and overall a great experience! I would definitely go back.
Brooke G.,/user_details?userid=W36mY85AEYcDWVPOFw7KIw,"Winslow Township, NJ",10/2/2016,3,Dumpling flavors were underwhelming. Went with a group of four and space was very very tight. Service was helpful but unwelcoming and seemed rush. Would not come back!
Eti H.,/user_details?userid=4rqQ21xdkhprZpo-sPYl-Q,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/27/2017,4,Very nice and clean place. Tasty dumplings cooked to perfection. Good service. Loved the shreded duck.
Joe L.,/user_details?userid=wqouGrbltDiA65E-KJ28bQ,"Princeton, NJ",9/21/2016,4,"So hungry and tired around past midnight and walked by this restaurant.  Considering the time, my expectations weren't so high.  Yet, the food and service was great.  I need to come back and know for sure on a regular lunch or dinner time."
Mia S.,/user_details?userid=T5hBnmHv4Jg8fhwVGobtVA,"Jersey City, NJ",9/17/2016,3,We went to Dim Sum Palace for a lite meal before the theatre so got there at 6:15pm.  Service is very slow and we got our all our food after asking for it several times.  The Dim Sum Tasty Menu was fair.  It all kind of tasted the same and was just kind of  blobs.  The chicken wth honey ginger sause was ok with the sauce on the side.  Next time we'll try one of the Thai places on 9th Avenue.
Caitlin M.,/user_details?userid=0XyRd7XBpq8XAghza5__xw,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",12/13/2016,3,"The delivery was super quick and ordering online easy.  The food itself was ok, nothing amazing.  I wasn't amazed like I thought based on previous reviews."
Mike G.,/user_details?userid=zdqT8s_giidXyhaBIG6xRA,"Milton, FL",3/17/2017,5,Just a wonderful place.  We were walking around Times Square looking for a place to eat and my wife saw this place.  So glad she did!!!

Jay D.,/user_details?userid=7jtwusAOPp_I_EMxLzPXxQ,"Santa Fe, NM",12/21/2017,5,"We've had dim sum in about a dozen cities, including San Francisco and Hong Kong.  The only places that offered better fare were one in Sydney's Chinatown and the old Flower Lounge in San Francisco, which closed about a decade ago.  The dumplings are all moist, juicy and tasty, and the taro dumpling, which is wet, is better than the usual wu kok.  A great choice for a late-night after- theatre snack."

Yue H.,/user_details?userid=O9VVmKJKFApi3kuNHURRog,"Berkeley, CA",2/17/2017,5,Loved the restaurant! We went in at around midnight and the waiters and waitresses are all really nice. The dim sums are fresh and tasty. Great place!

Denise M.,/user_details?userid=UbD1XFcUwxR_ImYlXsYtRA,"Simi Valley, CA",1/20/2017,2,Food was average at best but it did arrive in a timely manner although the driver would not deliver to my hotel room.

The Dim Sum were delicious, the wait staff friendly and helpful and the decor clean and unobtrusive. This restaurant has been added to our go-to places for delicious food in the theater district."
Miya O.,/user_details?userid=lLoCr7LLaTW4j_QGfwCh6g,"Chicago, IL",3/5/2017,3,Pretty good spot for even a casual craving or a massive feast if you want to go all out. Their service was good and they were friendly. I think the manager came over after and asked how we liked everything. Food is on the upper end of quality of places I've been to.
E S.,/user_details?userid=9QrP6sgH5KJK04iT8yca7w,"Manhattan, NY",10/2/2016,4,"Unbelievable! that there is actually delicious dim sum in the middle of tourist trap hell, a neighborhood in which I live.  I live 3 blocks away, and, honestly hate most of the 9th ave, and Restaurant Row joints. I m a very picky eater. SURPRISE!  Thank you for those yummy and super fresh har gow, shumai, fried pork/chive dumplings.  Above avg, and hope you expand the dim sum menu to a few more exotic items.  My new go to place in between working at the Broadway Theatres.  I may actually go back tomorrow for Happy Hour."
Caroline S.,/user_details?userid=sVi3BjEAWPok4mElLoq4tw,"Manhattan, NY",9/26/2016,5,This place is legit! Be brave and order the green sticky rice dumplings. They are filled with peanut goodness and amazing. Go and see why this place is always packed...I'm already craving more soup dumplings.
Ivory S.,/user_details?userid=x5jkaMuh1IAS1TrHKGDOFg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",12/24/2018,5,"Came here on Christmas eve at 12 30 in the night. Not only were they open, they had hot fresh and delicious dumplings plus the staff were so gracious. Enjoyed it thoroughly!"
Chris L.,/user_details?userid=JNvbc3Y-1zOF4Ljdak5RwQ,"Palm Desert, CA",12/24/2018,5,Excellent food. Small little restaurant with big flavor. Exceeded my expectations from when I walked in
Chris V.,/user_details?userid=1xY4B_O-uf1OLnBw5QOaIA,"Annapolis, MD",12/25/2017,2,"Not a fan. Unlike the many good reviews I simply think that the food here wasn't great. We ordered a lot of different dishes to share between three of us. The spare ribs were mostly bone, the spring roles had no flavor and the steamed dumplings fell apart once you bit through the glue-like dough. We don't come often to NYC and usually make sure to pick a good place with good reviews for dinner. Unfortunately this was a regretful decision and I don't agree with the rating of this restaurant. Additionally the atmosphere and look of the inside wasn't nice and the service relatively slow."
Charlene V.,/user_details?userid=fvnUEA0rSsCpmpc93pcOQQ,"San Jose, CA",8/30/2018,1,"Very rude customer service, took forever to come around and take our order, forgot an item on the order, we had to remind them to bring it to us, and when paying we were interrogated for not leaving a bigger tip. Definitely never coming back!!!"

Jonathan R.,/user_details?userid=TQipwAIbJq4guVzDjpxyQw,"Cypress, CA",8/16/2016,5,Great find for a closer dim sum place in Hell's Kitchen. All the food was delicious and fresh unlike other dim sum places.
Adam N.,/user_details?userid=CBVRPU1B1kT693U0IN8NKA,"Manhattan, NY",11/6/2016,5,"The food here was tremendous. The staff were extremely attentive and the meal came out much faster than we anticipated. Inside the restaurant is a little cramped but it was easy to forget the closeness once we tasted the food. The Dim Sum, fried rice and various entrees were excellent. Highly recommended."
Robert J.,/user_details?userid=ox8kk01_f_qM_CZnZtbJCg,"Kansas City, MO",11/6/2016,4,"There is a paper menu to order from, no trolley service. We sat for 15 minutes waiting to be served while 3 tables were seated around us and immediately served. That said, food was very good high made up for the below average service."
Devin H.,/user_details?userid=jidZ7inTNPQGo1XR0LEvYg,"Phoenix, AZ",7/29/2016,5,"The best place in NYC to have dim sum. The food and service is one to remember as I spent my time here in The Big Apple. By far the best place to go to if you're looking for cheap, authentic, and amazing food!"
Brittany L.,/user_details?userid=U7DCLKf2QZKHa0tVw8Qxyw,"Chicago, IL",7/26/2018,4,"Had a 7pm show to see so wanted a quick dinner near the theater.   This place was perfect and quick.  Had bbq pork buns, pot stickers, cheese and pineapple type of Rangoon, duck dumplings, and the crabmeat pork soup dumplings.  Everything was good.  Soup dumplings and bbq pork buns were the best out of everything.   Excellent service."
Ashleigh B.,/user_details?userid=WAuHDmezkHZr0OP6cu4J3w,"Elk River, MN",10/29/2016,5,Got to Dim Sum Palace at 5:15 found out 1/2 off all drinks and dim sum before 6pm great happy hour! food and drinks were great
Carol O.,/user_details?userid=BIEtYS9aVAKx4MPh4ChjtA,"New York, NY",4/15/2018,1,"Not good for large groups. They don't try to secure a group of 6, instead they will give away the tables to people of 2. They will give you 15 Min estimate to everyone by default. Eventually, we ended up waiting over 1 hr and left"
Pari V.,/user_details?userid=JlL75DslWfPU3KkVUAoQeA,"Manhattan, NY",7/15/2018,1,The food is terrible. Ordered dumplings and could barely eat them. They were soggy and lacked taste. Their fried taro was also completely lacking in any flavor. Dim sum is put to shame with these guys.
Brian C.,/user_details?userid=uJxDCwmklZRVf0HF4NVxlA,"New York, NY",4/8/2017,4,"probably the most authentic cantonese food in hells kitchen. fast service, and water refill game was on point. dim sum picture menu that you mark and give to the staff. notably more expensive than chinatown ($8 tea??) but you lose some you dim sum"
Julia T.,/user_details?userid=W2ycJ_vR2QYewvf6Aj44Rw,"Manhattan, NY",10/16/2016,5,I ordered from here for the first time tonight and I have to say the Buddha vegetarian dumplings were some of the best I've ever had. Absolutely delicious and such beautiful presentation too - even for delivery. The prices are also great and you can get a plethora of things for not a lot. Would highly recommend them - I've been living in this neighborhood for a year now and in search of a good Chinese food spot and am happy I found this spot.
Carol T.,/user_details?userid=QMYPkEkhOZrMWh65c7-b2w,"Bridgeport, CT",7/7/2018,2,"Not much options like other places for dim sum. Subpar dim sum, sad to say. I was really looking forward to the food here. The saké we had was literally half of a small wine glass...for $8. I suggest going elsewhere."
Andrew B.,/user_details?userid=VNC9IpAtL-P4NoBd17kGhQ,"Edgewater, NJ",4/4/2018,5,"Perfect shrimp dumplings, great rolled beef in rice noodles, the dim sum here are obviously the reason to come.  Other dishes we had were nicely done too, though not a fan of their spicy wontons."

Tina S.,/user_details?userid=IKvL5O80Dfc7WDGbSDfpkw,"Forest Park, IL",4/1/2018,4,"The service was good. The dim sum was okay. I know I can't judge based on one visit to one restaurant, but I was surprised the dim sum I get in Chicago is much better. It is very conveniently located and it wasn't horrible. If you are staying in a hotel nearby, go."
Spencer M.,/user_details?userid=aMeW_FQzq3E9owklLx1LKA,"Costa Mesa, CA",6/30/2018,5,Fantastic food. Amazing AMAZING dumplings!! I would highly recommend coming to get food here. Not your typical dim sum place. Please come here and you will not be disappointed
Anne S.,/user_details?userid=UM4eSMNSWY_FI0pz8XWNWA,"Bethesda, MD",3/28/2018,4,"Solid quality food. Wide variety. A good choice for Dim Sum. We didn't try any large dishes, but they all looked delicious. Would recommend."
Michelle R.,/user_details?userid=_LsSSWmoBPkdl9jmM2kNjw,"Manhattan, NY",11/22/2016,5,"We went to get dim sum, which they now serve all-day. Slightly expensive for dim sum (Chinatown is probably cheaper) but it was still so worth it because of the location and quality!! The food seemed to be made fresh and they came out at a good pace. The three of us ordered beef chow mein, chicken feet, xiao long nap, shrimp Shu mai, chive dumplings, and more. All highly recommend!!"
Tatiana R.,/user_details?userid=Kqy7z1KR4e52w4c-YkYFXQ,"Manhattan, NY",11/26/2016,4,Great food and fast delivery!! I ordered spicy eggplant and chicken with garlic sauce. I really enjoyed.
Jane L.,/user_details?userid=fWoAcjytZVPgkOmATx_tHg,"Manhattan, NY",3/20/2018,4,"Not a bad option if you're craving dim sum/dumplings uptown. The place definitely reflects midtown prices (you're going to be paying more than you would normally in chinatown), but it's open late and does delivery. However, they do have a great happy hour deal (3-5 PM, half off), so I would definitely recommend coming in for that. The restaurant is clean and the service is quick!"
Marianelia G.,/user_details?userid=aeTG4lwh3c4ESFqIEXUdpA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/13/2018,5,"Amazing, fresh, and flavorful dumplings. They have many options for vegetarians and they are half priced at happy hour. The shop is cute and clean."
Matthew M.,/user_details?userid=ppADmxWgvd7cxbhYRBje2Q,"Castro Valley, CA",9/15/2016,5,Excellent food! Dumplings were tasty and I'd definitely come back again if I lived in the area.
Rich N.,/user_details?userid=GKs3hWGF8v1jLo95Hp3_fQ,"Manhattan, NY",11/8/2016,5,I went there today with my family and it was a slow day. The manager wee was real nice and offered us free deserts because one of our orders came out a little late. We didn't even notice it was late :) the food was yummy. That's what is important
Yun C.,/user_details?userid=UYWZDtF-3GGxDlZ4N44Ygg,"Westwood, NJ",2/25/2017,1,"Food is ok, very small portions for the price. Would much rather go to Chinatown for dim sum. If you need to eat in the area, there are much better options than this place."
Rileigh L.,/user_details?userid=0GnFmbRZZE2Yz6uBZ9WHXg,"Chicago, IL",8/29/2016,4,"I took my dad, a newcomer to dim sum, here for the first time. They had a decent selection of dishes, which allowed us to try a lot of different things."
Jasmine J.,/user_details?userid=hj4mEZaG4UUa6n2Q5Oug4w,"Arlington, VA",8/28/2016,5,"Everything they brought out was delicious and the staff was very courteous and attentive and the restroom was very clean.  They were out of a few items on the dim sum special menu but everything they did have was very good.  I was with my vegan friend and there were surprisingly many options for her on the dim sum menu as well.  I didn't order anything off their regular menu, but if you order just off the special dim sum menu, you can have a very delicious well-priced meal (for New York City)."
Diane L.,/user_details?userid=BxA-1Q2ShB4p_h3Muj_tiA,"Philadelphia, PA",5/24/2018,2,"I did not like most of the things I tried this evening. I shared a dimsum platter, pork and chive dumplings, shrimp shumai, and salt and pepper soft shell crab. Most of the dimsums from the platter was a no-go. I liked the pork and chive dumplings and the shrimp shumai. The salt and pepper sof shell crab was EXTREMELY SALTY. Nonetheless, the staff was very courteous."
Marina B.,/user_details?userid=j7bmZTSxGNPWI42Da2rQWw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/23/2018,1,Spring rolls smelled like puke. Disgusting. Don't waste your money. Scallion pancake was ok. Prices don't match the food. Low your expectations.
Christine B.,/user_details?userid=3FM7H3rdDTBHw8yvhQuF9Q,"Cleveland, WI",8/12/2018,5,This was my favorite meal when I came to New York. The service was almost perfect.  The food was wonderful. I wish I could have tried more.
Christian L.,/user_details?userid=Poa_1gJKZmp61L-jngCKnQ,"Torrance, CA",8/10/2016,5,"The dim sum here is far greater than any others I've tried in LA. Great service, food, and value. Would highly recommend this for anyone looking to get some authentic dim sum and Chinese cuisine."
Grace F.,/user_details?userid=WQ__pEd1W7Bk2gKTKzBF3w,"Prague, Czech Republic",8/10/2016,5,This is an awesome place for dim sum in the theatre district! Loved the shrimp dumplings. All of the food was great. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. I hope I can go back soon!
Ying Z.,/user_details?userid=Kxk8SeKMXwNg8R9iFd_nzw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9/29/2018,5,"This is one of the best dim sum place I have ever been, and I am a really picky eater.

Alex L.,/user_details?userid=c1EBN1WQbj7OcmY6UmbqPw,"Charlotte, NC",5/8/2017,1,Worst experience ever... terrible service and overcharged to top things off. Added a dollar to each item and claimed they were fixing the computer....
E L.,/user_details?userid=sY71VexwCTyZS3WF8THssA,"Columbus, OH",5/15/2017,1,"The worst food we have ever had! Dirty, horrible Peking Duck all fat, we came based on reviews and just don't get how all these reviews were great. We eat dim sum all the time in San Francisco and this restaurant doesn't come close to even good. They advertise cantonese the chicken corn soup was a no taste bright yellow broth with no chicken and maybe 2 kernels of corn. We do not suggest eating here especially if you  are used to San Fran dim sum."
Jesse C.,/user_details?userid=27m910LHEEN2HfFQXA21Gg,"Manhattan, NY",9/12/2016,2,"Mediocre and expensive, bad ambiance, $8 for a pot of tea to myself....pass on this place, I'll stick to Chinatown."
Jerry X.,/user_details?userid=awgMKJ5zltjgiW1zFmpcMg,"Los Angeles, CA",9/5/2016,3,"If you had dim sum in Hong Kong or Chinatown, this place does not compare at all. Not impressed and certainly not authentic dim sum"
Jay'd H.,/user_details?userid=BjVcZmZHHwwWz3YzY6F7wg,"Lowry Hill East, Minneapolis, MN",9/3/2018,2,"Food was all good - a few of our items were obviously forgotten about, and then forgotten about again once they got put in the steamer. Service it's self was TERRIBLE! Our waitress took our order and we didn't see her again until we were ready for our check which took at least 30 minutes to get to the table. Servers were MIA our entire meal and then got an attitude when we pointed out that we had been waiting for our food for nearly 45 minutes."
Daria Z.,/user_details?userid=84TdDzdXTpoHQtfJFy4eBw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/8/2016,5,"Best Dim Sums I've ever had! Very tender, delicious filling. Best thing, all half priced from 4 to 7 pm!"

I loved dim sam, my experiences few are real authentic Hong Kong or Shanghai dim sam! Yummy..! First, the place was well decorated, very neat and bright not dark or low dimmed lights. Simply comfortable. Servers are top, mostly restaurants got good chef? But very low bad services! Food are fresh and did not take that long but took little time. It was all delicious!! Very pleased! Also got the opportunity to meet the manager/chef, he is so kind and polite person. We had met before and most off the servers in others Chinese restaurants and services was great! Dear neighbors try this place out!  They just opened few days ago. I really guaranteed you will find your next hidden local restaurants of top listings! Awesome lucky find for tourist..! May you have a great time as I did it!"

Miss D.,/user_details?userid=1k6-ibWoXtlbQFNi0oWhgw,"Los Angeles, CA",12/19/2017,1,"Very surprised at the high reviews. I can only review the Chinese food and delivery, never had the dim sum, and based on my two experiences my advice would be to avoid this place. Delivery is incompetent and doesn't fulfill the order completely and the food wasn't very warm. Aside from the white rice EVERYTHING was oily, the egg rolls were soft and the smallest/thinnest I'd ever seen, the general tso chicken was mushy, and the shrimp fried rice was average at best. Really wanted to like this place to satisfy the occasional Chinese food craving on nights too tired to leave home but fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Ugh complete waste of time and money. Never again."
Jason P.,/user_details?userid=0OZt77uD3A-HG_Z-zLcLFw,"Saint John, Canada",6/18/2018,4,"Great selection of items as part of their dim sum. Building looks a little sketchy outside, but it is finished nicely inside. The staff were friendly and helpful. Food was very tasty."

We got the scallion pancake, BBQ pork buns and various other items. Pretty good, we'd go back but might only get steamed dumplings."
Jacquelyn H.,/user_details?userid=_0R861DflLu93iqA9JOqVw,"Orangevale, CA",5/31/2018,5,"This restaurant was packed but they were really fast in getting us a seat.  The food was amazing!  Everything we agree was delicious and they had a great variety.

Suchan A.,/user_details?userid=Sk7cnLVs5UdOdp5NKZvmPg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2/22/2017,1,"The worst noodle ever. Dimsum was pretty good, but the ""hongkong style pan fried noodle"" was terrible. It was so thick and hard. I wrap the leftover and throw it away"
Fan S.,/user_details?userid=z3OZBgxu01w_wMJu8cB-Jw,"TRINITY, NY",10/26/2017,2,the food is average and a little overpriced for its portion. poor service. the waiter doesn't even know how to run credit cards. (he ran on the wrong card and didn't even want to bother fix it). overall not great experiences and don't recommend it.
Alex R.,/user_details?userid=Ykgl1cEjLwL4cSLAKmGkyw,"McKinney, TX",6/14/2017,2,"Well this been a disappointment. Before we get to the food let's just talk about the experience. We we ""greeted by a man that was to busy to get off his cell phone. So he throws up a three sign slaps a table and walks away. After a few minutes we finally get only 2 menus for 3 of us and one paper dim sum menu. He spews out something about half price dim sum as throws the paper menu in the middle of the table and runs off without taking a drink order. About 10 minutes later he finally comes to take our drink order and meal. We tell him drinks. And at the speed of light he starts running through our paper menu. We try to stop him and say we need a second one because we want separate checks. Ignoring us he insists on interpreting our scribbles intended to help us order faster when the second menu came. Nope he wasn't having it and when he finally acknowledged we wanted separate checks he stormed of bitching to the bartender in a language I don't speak but I understand one thing. Separate checks is the same in English jerk. So now we get to the one guy that orders off the main menu. His dish doesn't come with rice. So he asked for fried. You would think he slap his mama. No no no fried, $2 for a side of white and he walks away.  So my friend asked when he comes back. He says I told white you have to order a full order. We don't want a full order. He says you can all share. Again if we all wanted it we would have ordered it.   So thinking we where just stuck we wait for the food and I begin writing this.  Now to the food. It all comes out and looks delicious and it was. Every bit was fantastic. Until we get to the main menu order. I can't be sure but they may have a barber in the kitchen. Not one but multiple hairs.  Here is where the tide turns. We call them over and immediately they start a new order.  They in fact left it where we could see it so we knew it was a fresh order. In addition they went ahead and gave him a side of fried rice. Unfortunately the service tainted what should have a wonderful meal. I'm not sure but I will probably give them one more chance."
Eric L.,/user_details?userid=N-lvb4QYUAzZZU_1sVhbMA,"Paris, France",6/9/2017,2,"First time we went there they were closed for a private event. We went again the next day and they were open. Wish they were closed. The dim sums were among the best I had. The dumplings, soup and pancakes were less than ordinary and the SOUP CAME WITH A BUG INSIDE. Needless to say that although I appreciate the extra protein, I'm not going there ever again."
Lucy Waalkens W.,/user_details?userid=3OMOm6OoW1vwl6G2dP0MZg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/31/2018,4,Great food - on the high side for price I had 4 plates and 2 drinks and paid 60$ before tips - whilst it was worth it I'm used to paying a lot less for dim sum - staff were all friendly and I like how it's late night utilised this fact whilst waiting for friends to go out for the night - would have been a 5 if not for the price
Rachel G.,/user_details?userid=hZD_iEBZqpFOp2xSzyW1yQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/23/2018,2,"Good service, crappy dim sum. You can taste the fake ingredients and chemicals in the food..."
A. K.,/user_details?userid=0HxES8Tc1WKJHDbHJ5oGJg,"New York, NY",3/23/2018,2,"I would suggest only going during happy hour (3-5 p.m. weekdays excluding holidays).  I would have been unhappy paying $80 (no liquor) for the dishes I ordered, but at $40 (half price off dim sum at happy hour) the meal  was ok.  The assortment of dim sum is good, but the food is oily.  Also, the food comes out too fast.  So order a few things.  Eat.  Then order a few more rather than ordering everything all at once.  The best dishes were the shrimp and pork shu mai, chicken shu mai, and the scallion pancakes.  The turnip cake was too oily.  The pan fried tiny bun needed more filling.  The duck was much too fatty, but in a delicious five spice sauce.  The crispy spare ribs were not crispy but they also weren't meaty.  The meat that was there was tasty, though.  My search for terrific dim sum continues."
M G.,/user_details?userid=urXCTUWs2vtgqq6YgxcgJg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/14/2018,5,"Some of the best food in the hell that is midtown! Ridiculously expensive most of the time, so go during happy hour to get half-price dim sum. Soy bean dumplings and sesame pancakes are my favorite. Restaurant itself isn't much to look at and it's very hot in there but definitely worth the deal and the taste."
gina a.,/user_details?userid=BtdG7sKcbzGascdD6stvKg,"New York, NY",6/23/2017,3,Their weekend menu is bigger. I went on a weekday and they didnt serve several dishes I wanted to get from these pics on yelp. I've had better dimsum in Chinatown!

Berit R.,/user_details?userid=MIB9C2O6I897zbqvrG2Aag,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/31/2017,5,This place was amazing.  There is a somewhat large variety of dim sum..etc.  every dumpling we ordered was great.  Plus the dim sum order always comes with special sauces which are great.  And best of all it was super cheap.  Totally recommend
Deb O.,/user_details?userid=lwDwLpWuqJrQfCcJQr7LpQ,"Orlando, FL",11/26/2017,5,"We love eating local, this fit the bill and was around the corner from the theater. It was authentic, reasonably priced and had a full bar. Excellent selection, reasonably priced and delicious."
Hanna N.,/user_details?userid=sOSdqeNzQp5ZTACiS3DN2Q,"Boston, MA",6/12/2017,4,"Food is pretty good. I recommend going during their happy hour since dim sum is 50% off. I would say it's still over priced compared to places in chinatown but locals, consider you saved the $5.50 metro fee."
Chen-Feng T.,/user_details?userid=YzJyoao6p3vetCIRDKV0Sg,"Manhattan, NY",7/24/2016,5,Great food！Just u need to pay extra for tea. Dim sum is very delicious. Even better than those in Taiwan.
Jorge G.,/user_details?userid=_6BncJ9dxgcIMd7_zj518g,"Miami, FL",4/16/2017,5,Best dim sum ever had. Comparable to yak sing in san fran. Very reasonable and would definitely return.
J L.,/user_details?userid=cftkavXztCP0YAqeRUpdIQ,"New York, NY",2/8/2018,5,"This is an oasis in midtown.  I've been here many times and each time the food was perfect so I keep coming back.  I come here with friends when we need to meet for dinner in midtown or need to catch a show. Because I've been here so many times, I have eaten the majority of all of their dim sum and they have all been just mouth watering good.  It's a popular theatre spot and because they are so reliable and consistently good, the turn around here is rapid and constant, so everything is always fresh.  I have ventured only a little outside of the dim sum menu and have had the Rice Noodle with Beef (Beef Chow Fun) which was fabulous and just right.  I've had this Cantonese dish in Hong Kong and Dim Sum Palace's version is just as good.  Once a friend even ordered Shrimp Fried Rice which I consider silly but I have to admit it was very tasty."
JC L.,/user_details?userid=hsnsWUSbSow7Fn3MxLOVgA,"Arcadia, CA",7/16/2016,5,"Very delicious and reasonable price. Service is really good.

Joseph P.,/user_details?userid=6KVAmoCQUMgyJfEecCTc0g,"New York, NY",7/30/2017,2,"First, let me say that I could be falling prey to an ""Americanized"" conception of Chinese cuisine. That being said, everything tasted unfamiliar to me. Dishes that I've ordered elsewhere were only recognizable visually from this restaurant. The tastes were all unfamiliar, and not particularly pleasant, at least for me. The dim sum were quite exotic, (I ordered pork and shrimp) but man, the sauce they include is fairly hot, which I do like but I wasn't expecting. Not for me."
Riyaad A.,/user_details?userid=Z-lSzi5WJGsIW_R4zogLuw,"Valley Stream, NY",5/18/2017,2,"It's decent cantonese food. I ordered a chicken & shrimp fried rice, it wasn't terrible, but nothing special as well."

Kathy W.,/user_details?userid=TQAUeiklbop3K1dDF43QwQ,"Greenville, TX",10/6/2017,5,"This place has the best Thai food!  I got the cachew nut with chicken and a bowl of white rice.  My husband got the shrimp curry dish with a bowl of rice.  We also got spring rolls as appetizers! Everything was simply delicious.  The wait staff was excellent.  Also, they made my favorite drink, gin and tonic, which is the best I have ever had!"
T G.,/user_details?userid=JRJcVaePxkd-_MKRxWwKkQ,"SPRINGFIELD GARDENS, NY",7/2/2017,5,Everything here is delicious. Went twice in 2 weeks and want more! Best dim sum ever!
Maria H.,/user_details?userid=5RTK97iROYWOYAtiCnCRfA,"San Francisco, CA",2/24/2018,3,"I am from out of town, actually, from Sydney.  I have read the good reviews, so thought my husband and I would try the restaurant.  I was expecting fabulous food - dim sums were fresh and tasty.  Also had fried rice with eggs & escallion, which were great, as they were not at all oily. But, got let down by the vegetables with garlic which were mostly stalks.  Worst let down of the night was 1 green tea, which they charged me for USD8.00.  Why $8.00?  For crying out loud, the tea was not even organic.  I have ad dinner in hatted restaurants in different countries, but not one of them charged $8.00 .  All up, paid $71.00+ for 2 people including 2 beers & pork ribs."
Stephanie P.,/user_details?userid=Y6hoB-GR4K3Re4_vF2L4IA,"Scarsdale, NY",2/26/2018,5,"Great dim sum and attentive service. This is my go to dim sum restaurant, especially for Sunday lunch. I especially loved the seafood shumai, shrimp rolls, pork buns, and rose tea."
Regina C.,/user_details?userid=RKsOdb5A8R3kw5coPdRpYQ,"Massapequa Park, NY",9/8/2017,5,I couldn't believe how great dim sum was outside of Chinatown. I was skeptical but it didn't disappoint. Service was great. Food exceeded expectations and the prices were appropriate. We'd definitely go back! Legit dim sum in Midtown. Who knew!
Jennifer G.,/user_details?userid=88kVhd2mMw5vFM_jvKOo5g,"Concord, CA",9/19/2016,5,"For those who want dim sum without going all the way to Chinatown, this is the answer.  The dim sum is probably a little more than it would be in Chinatown but you save all the time it it would take to get to Chinatown as well as the cab or subway fare.  The shrimp dumpling had huge shrimp in it. All the dim sum was good and cooked after you order it so it is fresh and hot.  Better yet it is served all day and the server told us it is half of during their health hour.  The other food looked good as well.  Definitely worth a return visit to try other items.  Service was outstanding."
Linda D.,/user_details?userid=iksyQEN0WATrtpqPnGDyJA,"Golden, CO",7/16/2016,5,Handmade and fresh. Probably the most authentic dim sum I've tasted in America thus far. Perfect place if you're looking for a late night dim sum place.
Shengtao H.,/user_details?userid=7SWmcZ4f5Bp9W9ynl3xQYQ,"University City, Philadelphia, PA",7/16/2016,5,"Great food. If you are Cantonese, you will like this place. Their dimsum is really good."
Ziep T.,/user_details?userid=CcNA41gfPOgKoQDPg_mZnw,"Falls Church, VA",9/4/2017,5,Great dimsum! Very fine taste.  Try the pan fried tiny buns.  We ordered extra to take home.

Romil P.,/user_details?userid=FsnbLj1sy-GuzirX4zpmbg,"Oviedo, FL",5/26/2017,5,Cute restaurant.  Nice staff. Delicious food.  We got the chicken dumplings and BBQ pork buns and each order was amazingly fresh and steaming hot! I would recommend it
Donna B.,/user_details?userid=1J9bPc7FkeExk5A8gyvT3g,"Niantic, CT",8/21/2017,5,We went here this past Saturday after a Broadway play because of the Yelp reviews and were not disappointed! We had dim sum and the food was great!  The staff was very friendly and helpful and we loved everything. Highly recommended.
Julie M.,/user_details?userid=MJ_i9i3cwTRlesCJb3gYmw,"Norman, OK",3/11/2017,3,"We visited here for lunch because they had such great reviews on yelp, but we were underwhelmed. The food was average and the service wasn't great at all. We really wanted to like this place. There were quite a few people there for lunch so maybe it just wasn't for us."
Johnny C.,/user_details?userid=dH8kmrq6WUIm-2FDp7J0bA,"Atlanta, GA",7/31/2017,5,Great! Usually beef at Chinese restaurants is tough and chewy. The beef in our chow fun was tender. Dumplings good too. Well done!
Jennifer K.,/user_details?userid=dOIz2pz0_PexCd2aOXVyng,"Manhattan, NY",2/16/2017,5,"Really fresh dumplings, awesomely friendly staff, and a casual but nice atmosphere where you won't feel rushed. Had a great lunch experience."
Phil N.,/user_details?userid=38lxSQNnKGbcx4ZVfsthEA,"San Jose, CA",4/21/2017,5,"A hidden gem near Times Square.  Dim sum and food are very good, tasty, and great service too.  Fully recommended!"
Michelle L.,/user_details?userid=4mHESENTGAlEdnzmzYYxfA,"Edgewater, NJ",7/21/2016,5,"Traditional dim sum - delicious, comparable to Flushing.  Wonderful service and modern decors.  Highly recommend this midtown gem!"
Mike W.,/user_details?userid=U_AmIUswNh0rgdAmY91Uew,"Bronx, NY",4/13/2017,5,Very fresh and tasty food.  I work in Times Square and have been looking for genuine good tasting Chinese food!  My new favorite!!
Max L.,/user_details?userid=QOqOZci3qxV0lRWnk2ybPA,"Brooklyn, NY",7/7/2017,5,"Great, relatively cheap dim sum right near Times Square!  Shrimps spring rolls, salt and pepper squid and shumai were a hit!  I'll be back!"

Julie H.,/user_details?userid=eWXggNpcP18nyl2PG0kfUA,"Eatontown, NJ",8/25/2016,1,Worst place ever! It took 20 minutes for the server to come and even acknowledge us while we were seated at a table. They did not ask what drinks we wanted or give us the drinks first. The food finally came like 20 minutes after ordering and they forgot the drinks so the guy comes along and gives it to us. Turns out we didn't even get 2 things that we ordered!!! The guy took off the charge for the other 2 things that we didn't get. But smh this place is absolutely horrible!!!!
Shawn G.,/user_details?userid=8T-B00r4zIAwRdXTtIwWwA,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",6/25/2017,5,"Stopped in for some dim sum after a show and the food was delicious. I especially loved the dumplings with the soup inside. Service was speedy and courteous and for $50, I thought it was a great value."
Hdtv D.,/user_details?userid=WyE79FYph4PwDn34SsBCGw,"Delray Beach, FL",1/5/2017,4,"The delivery experience was quite good, twice in on week. The food was also very good. We tried a mix of items from Dim Sum to Lo Mein and all of it very good."
greg w.,/user_details?userid=8wB6eTh87SLump3HD6NMWg,"New York, NY",12/28/2016,5,The pork buns and shuanghai juicy pork buns are the best I have ever had.  Sorry SF you need to come try this place.  Being from the west coast I am used to good Dim Sum and I am so happy this place is a 5 blocks from my home.
John D.,/user_details?userid=YhZEyPu9sS_l6Yby4SE_Kg,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",9/13/2017,4,Definitely some good food and great vibes you should give it a try if you're looking for dim sum in the area
Harrison E.,/user_details?userid=V06ij3eTWp8H-0LeVRIQBw,"Simsbury, CT",3/1/2017,4,Sweet little place right near the theaters... I wish it was a little less authentic because the dim sum menu is not all that clear and the waiters are not translators so I pretty much go with my gut and have yet to be disappointed.
Julie M.,/user_details?userid=Lc50KXHc1-MuvZajifwnMQ,"Hampton, NH",2/25/2017,4,"Had lunch here today , variety of dumplings - duck, pork, shrimp all delicious. Highly recommend for lunch before a show. Service was great as well."
Mary L.,/user_details?userid=jvfU9sfs3se7w55Y9B_VCA,"North Reading, MA",2/25/2017,5,"Cozy place close to the shows and our hotel. Got take-out of different varieties of potstickers and one chicken dish. Woman was very helpful and invited us to sit at the bar with s glass of water while we waited. Wish we had ordered more food, everything was delicious."
Bazil M.,/user_details?userid=ca-WjohZ7NETSU1L7JY1bA,"Glen William, Australia",8/30/2017,5,"Having done my share of international travelling I always refer to reviews for feedback and whether or not to dine, drink, shop etc and rarely leave reviews so I thought I should help others too and get on the bus. Well I can only give positive reviews on this place. The order sheet for dumplings, buns and lunch menus was easy to follow and got our order in quickly and without any confusion. We received the starters very quickly and we placed our share plate orders then and not long after finishing these our mains were ready. Now I am a huge fan of authentic cooked duck (really the only one out of the four of us) and seriously this was the best I've had. I ordered the half roast duck and it was so moist and flavoursome that I had to fight for my lions share. We had several other dishes that were equally as great and the fried rice was excellent. So thumbs up to Dim Sum!! Next time in NY I will definitely visit."
Fay W.,/user_details?userid=p17VePG2_qn7Niy55kDS8g,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/22/2017,1,"Me and my husband we paid $70 for two dishes and one fried noodle. We ordered black been prawn, we counted the prawn, 6 pcs, for $21.95; we also ordered boiled fish spicy, there might be only 200gm of frozen fish fillet and some been sprouts in there, sold for $24.95; $13.95 of fried noodle, it's ok; and we paid $4 for two bowls of white rice, that's ridiculously overpriced. At the time we made the order, we didn't worry too much about the price, cos normally in US, the servicing of food is big, we thought their serving could be big too, given the environment of the restaurant is very noisy, their food must be great with these kind of pricing. However, the portion of serving was ridiculously small, over priced, taste was ordinarily, environment was old and noisy. This restaurant is extremely over rated!! Don't come!"
Jenn M.,/user_details?userid=WZTZJpU3Ql2SJgNvFsJpvA,"Fairview, NJ",2/19/2017,5,Really surprised by how fresh the dumplings are. Everything we had was great. Always looks crowded but walked right in and got a table without any wait. Fast paced service and quick turn around. Great for pre-show meal and within easy walking distance of most theaters. Very friendly staff.
Ann M.,/user_details?userid=5dADEkSdAbPL6wn_ErlbOA,"Chatham, NJ",8/25/2017,5,We went to Dim Sum Palace before seeing a show. It was delicious and reminded us of our time in Asia. So yummy.
Judith M.,/user_details?userid=tp6dJgM_AB9aD2Ii_1gcKg,"Bonita Springs, FL",7/9/2016,5,Outstanding dim sum quality even though variety less than huge places in china town.  So convenient to theaters. Everything pipping hot made to order. Will return.
John D.,/user_details?userid=d9nA0N5rlN2EalEg8qm8OQ,"Anna Maria, FL",10/14/2017,5,"Came to NYC from Florida for a long weekend and took a chance at Dim Sum Palace based on the reviews, We were not disappointed... the service was excellent, they treated us like regulars, the Dim Sum was perfect and some of the best we have had. I wish they could open a shop in Florida by us......"
Evelyn T.,/user_details?userid=xBpNw47VjmY5sVoLsQEcDg,"Jersey City, NJ",2/8/2017,5,"Surprised to find a good dimsum place in Midtown.  Went there pre-Broadway show and was craving for dimsum dishes, happy to find this place.  They are made fresh, I love the tray of condiments: soy sauce, chili sauce and ginger bits.  Love the place."
Tukeefoodie T.,/user_details?userid=w7W7rNYRuC2MqKC7v7gvkQ,"Phoenix, AZ",5/10/2017,4,"Food was great! Good location to catch a show and still eat before without crazy crowds. Beware, the drinks are expensive, vodka tonic was 14.00 per drink!  The drinks were well made though.  Had pork and chive dumplings, BBQ pork buns and crispy garlic spare ribs to start. Shared beef with broccoli, chicken lo mein and king pao chicken between 3 of us.  The Kung pao was spicy but still nice.  BBQ pork buns he sweet BBQ pork, maybe a little too sweet.  Overall, very good!"
Julie B.,/user_details?userid=cZJ2dxLcLyAP1CWO97Rcrw,"San Diego, CA",11/26/2016,5,"Freakin' delicious!  We had seven orders of varied dumplings, all of which were amazing!  The staff was very helpful, and the dining room was clean, as was the restroom. We loved it, ad our post theatre meal.  Yum!"
Sharon F.,/user_details?userid=exr-ADRHfMDSRSpuOpBDsQ,"Randolph, NJ",5/8/2017,5,Best dim sum EVER including an attentive wait staff. Get there early because this place gets super crowded from 6pm onwards. My favorite place to grab a quick bite after a Saturday matinee. Easy walk from the theater district.
Rebecca F.,/user_details?userid=YlgGUKoWi8yhTf2O-NkviA,"Baltimore, MD",2/3/2017,5,Great menu and selection. The sampler is a good choice to taste lots of different choices before ordering more.  Good service too.
David S.,/user_details?userid=R5p_lubgcafzIRZKbgVN2w,"New York, NY",5/4/2017,5,"I recently found this place on my last trip to NY.  Just got back.  I always look for a good Chinese restaurant when I come to NY and the Dim Sum Palace is my new favorite place.  The dim sum is great(although limited choices for those who don't eat pork, like me).  We had the shrimp with honey walnut (the shrimp was so fresh and tasted great), beef with broccoli,  lo mein,  and the Peking duck (very nice, but I've had better).  The service was quick and helpful. everyone was very polite.  can't wait to go back."
G R.,/user_details?userid=w8v5exdwKmY3OjrYOIjlAQ,"New York, NY",4/21/2017,4,"Pretty excellent dim sum and convenient midtown location.  the service was friendly & attentive Our food arrived quickly, we will go back again."

Xinyan S.,/user_details?userid=lR3oRUx5D27RWOv_faS__A,"Manhattan, New York, NY",8/28/2017,1,The food is ok. Burly the delivery guy had the worst attitude in the world. He cursed to my brother and spoke lots of dirty words.
Xinyue C.,/user_details?userid=58p0at4fX90asIcYsu1Svg,"Madison, WI",3/22/2019,1,"So disappointed to dim sum palace on 46th st. Never wanna go or order food in this place anymore.  I order the food online for delivery.  And I write down very clearly no onion in my beef chow fun. Cause I'm allergy to onion. But when I eat it, i still found the onion in it. I had to take the medicine after all. I ordered the fish mew crab soup for 4 people, it cost me $21.95, every time they send two tons of soup for 4 people. This time they only send me one. I thought it's the restaurant got mistake. So I call them and can't believe the owner give me so bad attitude and yelling at me. He said there is 2 different price for soup which is not on the menu. I just wanna ask which restaurant that you have 2 different price and it's not showing on the menu?! That was ridiculous. And also he said if come to the restaurant to eat, the price will even more expensive $1-$2. I never know that the price will change by the owner's mood. This is my first write a bad review to a restaurant. Can't believe that they have this bad service and attitude to the customer."
Pauline S.,/user_details?userid=tR4em_U_CLyklW85tWaiSw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6/2/2017,4,"My friends and I decided to eat here on our first day in New York. We arrived at the restaurant just as happy hour started (half off of most menu items including dim sum). The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. The food is delicious and full of flavour, and a good price. The only thing is that the serving sizes are a lot smaller than I'm used to."
Wendy L.,/user_details?userid=D4Og7rbSPRvKLa_9KlArjg,"Southfield, MI",11/26/2016,4,"We ordered six different types of dim sum for the three of us.  All were great; we especially liked the steamed pork, BBQ pork buns and seafood shu Mai.  Nice atmosphere and not full of tourists considering its proximity to Times Square.  Great place for an inexpensive dinner."
Tate D.,/user_details?userid=cyC7tQkkNmq0ye1W-gbfzg,"Columbia, SC",2/24/2017,5,Very good dim sum. The service and food were excellent. I will definitely come back for more.
Alice T.,/user_details?userid=OeIynj7tS1VtAYyh47xfdg,"Manhattan, NY",11/6/2016,5,"Best dim sum restaurant in manhattan. The menu options might be fewer than the ones in china town, but the taste is the best. Very authentic!"
Paulina K.,/user_details?userid=tRBfIbavh1HlfrePNxAH5A,"Los Angeles, CA",8/25/2016,5,Stumbled upon this place unexpectedly and was very pleasantly surprised ! We ordered 10 different dumplings and only paid $56.13 ! All of them were amazing too !!
Sanny D.,/user_details?userid=f3Gt-jBaDaRUOnodhgIi6g,"Silver Spring, MD",5/7/2017,5,All kinds of dim sum. The waitresses are kind and nice. Food is delicious and authentic. Love the place! Will definitely come again!
Raj B.,/user_details?userid=OZrVKPdjuwhlQqm_HDQvWQ,"San Francisco, CA",1/31/2017,5,"Unexpectedly awesome. The value of this place is in the freshness and quality of food. We couldn't believe believe how fresh the food was, and the price a very pleasant surprise. Hard to find something this good only minutes from Times Square."
Foodie N.,/user_details?userid=jnUiRFOY_oAI251NiBPM-Q,"BASKING RIDGE, NJ",1/17/2017,4,"went to see a show last Wed afternoon.  Initially we wanted to try out another place for lunch on 46th street,btw 8th and 9th ave.  But the place was closed.  So we decided to try this place which we just passed by.  We were pleasantly surprised.  They serve authentic dim sum and Cantonese noodle dishes.  We deliberately ordered something we don't usually find in other Chinese places.  We had House Special seafood chow twin mei fun, pineapple cheese wonton, and chou zhou dumpling with pork and peanut.  All were well done with the right flavor and texture.  The quality is really up to HK standard. My only complain is the portion is a little small...but also a HK standard for fine dinning. LOL"
Lexi S.,/user_details?userid=x2zRpq2Sv95SJ_LAdbgEwA,"Arden, NC",1/14/2017,5,The delivery was fast and the food was hot when it arrived. We got the chicken lo mein and general tso chicken for lunch. Both were delicious and I'd definitely order from there again.
Bridgette A.,/user_details?userid=g9qP2mA_ul-wL3Z5dTRDZw,"Clawson, MI",7/26/2016,5,I've never had Dim Sum but am glad I tried. The food was fantastic! Everything was fresh & fast!! The pork & chive dumplings were great as well as the spring rolls!! Definitely worth going here! Only downfall was the limited alcohol selection.
Jomo B.,/user_details?userid=cF5g1_bUKZzK4A9AGtm49Q,"Los Angeles, CA",9/30/2016,5,Better than Beijing!  Chicken in black bean sauce is A-mazimg! DIMSUM deliciousness.  Must go when in town!
Michelle P.,/user_details?userid=jzhkP8bHraL-xxihtyvW3A,"Austin, TX",9/25/2016,5,"Ok, so I don't live in NYC, but I am a dim sum fan. Anywhere you can get freshly made dumplings at 2 am, that are incredibly good, gets 5 stars from me!"
Ruobo P.,/user_details?userid=OsFBcc9iQxQ2R7uP2-eE2w,"San Francisco, CA",9/24/2016,5,Very good place for dim sum lovers near Times area. The resteraunt is clean and we were nicely served. The flavor is decent. We tried several dim sums and we all loved them. Btw it is not expensive one comparing neighbourhood food places. Highly recommend!
Todd F.,/user_details?userid=Xi61j0u-BwEXxfW7L1hpjw,"Southampton, PA",3/22/2017,5,Great selection of dim sum. We tried quite a variety. My wife said the sweet sesame balls were the best she had ever had. Service was very good and the prices are more than reasonable. Definitely worth visiting. More than once.
J C.,/user_details?userid=cLG_AphA17sxZIS4gcl5KA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/10/2016,4,The food is good. Pricey. Wonton soup $7!!! Definitely worth it during happy hour dim sum.
Neelu R M.,/user_details?userid=c8QyRde7y9hxUNbxyPr3mA,"Brooklyn, NY",8/30/2016,5,Delicious food! Lots of options for vegetarians as well! Loved their Lo mein and dim sums
Michael W.,/user_details?userid=0rAuOZyTEI3kjvUxO0SdtA,"Queens, NY",11/6/2016,5,The food is exceptional and the bartender Wee was great. My girlfriend and I had 4 dim sum and an entree. Price was reasonable for the location. Will definitely be back the next time if i crave quality chinese food.
Meegan G.,/user_details?userid=L14ID7oCSlbQXoohHtLuzQ,"Canton, MA",7/8/2016,5,Excellent! Authentic! The dumplings remind me of being in China. Service is very polite and attentive. And they have fantastic happy hour 1/2 price dim sum and  drinks.
Jennifer G.,/user_details?userid=s1QTWrStg8bpdI38rJ-KgA,"Yonkers, NY",10/1/2016,5,Saw good Yelp reviews and decided to try this place before theater. As soon as we saw the line for tables we knew we had made the right choice. Really delicious dim sum. Will definitely come back!
Jake K.,/user_details?userid=u8ZBVG-B0zGVbIMT8oIMjg,"Rockville, MD",12/26/2016,2,"The dim sum was great, but that was about it. I got the kung pow chicken and it was very bland. The table also got the beef and broccoli and the beef was very chewy and hard to swallow. On top of all of that it was a little pricey. Would not recommend."
Bhairavi V.,/user_details?userid=7wXsjTQVx54Vl22b69GB9w,"San Francisco, CA",9/10/2016,1,"The dimsums were undercooked and so sticky. They had a very limited number of vegetarian options. And they forgot the main course ! After we ate our appetisers they came to us wondering what we were waiting for. Wen we said we were waiting on our mains, that is when they punched it in. They didn't even bring us larger plates for the mains and were not apologetic about this. They seemed very complacent and resulted in a poor experience given the food was average at best."
Casey D.,/user_details?userid=95NVR1Ld31h_Xs7_VJcBHg,"Manhattan, NY",8/24/2016,4,"They have a small but solid selection of dim sum available all day. The dim sum is really good and you're not gonna find a better dim sum place in Midtown. It's a little pricier than Chinatown but you can still get a full meal for less than 20$. The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star review is because I waited close to an hour for the dim sum to appear on the table, but I chalk that down to them being a new restaurant. The service is also really good (something you won't find in Chinatown)."
Cherry L.,/user_details?userid=PChUZVMJve23FPb47sg75Q,"Torrance, CA",8/10/2016,5,"We lucked on on our last day in New York. The food at this restaurant is fresh, authentic, and just truly exceptional.  The service was great and personal. The restaurant has only been open for a month and we took advantage of the 50% discount on dim sum.  With food this good, Dim Sum Palace will definitely become a tradition right in Times Square."
Michelle D.,/user_details?userid=MOrwdhMrIOXUqsg04-0FCg,"East Meadow, NY",2/22/2018,2,"I'll start off by saying this was my first authentic dim sum experience so I can only compare it to itself. I chose this place from the rave yelp reviews, but we were very disappointed with our meal. We swung by for happy hour in December but were told happy hour was cancelled for the holiday season?! Strike 1. The place was pretty empty but service was slow. We actually had to call the servers over to take our drink order and then again for the food order. Strike 2. We went all out and ordered pork/scallion dumplings, veggie spring rolls, shrimp/pork dumplings, soy bean dumplings, bbq pork buns and crispy garlic spare ribs. Everything was piping hot and fresh but the flavors were underwhelming. My ""preferences"" were the bbq pork buns and edamame dumplings, but they were just ok. The spare ribs were inedible. You literally had to gnaw dry bits of meat, fat and cartilage off of chopped up bone. It was unappetizing, my carnivore husband couldn't even get through them so we sent them back. Strike 3. We left hungry. I love dumplings and the whole idea of the dim sum experience so I'll try it again, just not here."
Gemma L.,/user_details?userid=DTcBYvUjFeEexBD8d3mO0Q,"Wantagh, NY",7/22/2016,5,I went here with my whole famil on a Friday night. The food is authentic Chinatown quality but the service is exceptionally friendly and accommodating. Loved it.
Ashley T.,/user_details?userid=hyM0ShyzauD0LAZfDGwVNw,"Manhattan, NY",10/15/2016,5,"Great dim sum in Hells Kitchen. Will definitely be making this a regular, reminiscent of childhood weekends with my family."

Helen D.,/user_details?userid=iQd9ZptdkbGBeU98TmtyFA,"Maplewood, NJ",8/10/2016,5,"Great for our whole family. Happy Hour prices made it even more appealing.

Alex K.,/user_details?userid=aHwM3h6m20NQrvY-UBAkpA,"New York, NY",8/9/2016,5,"An employee reached out to make up for the situation, all good now."
Sheena B.,/user_details?userid=qpGNj59J3GepFK6rq3d41Q,"Shrewsbury, MA",9/14/2016,4,"Came here on a Sunday morning. We were sat immediately and the menu was clearly explained. We made our selections and waited for the dishes to show up. We did order a duck dumplings and shrimp showed up in its place. Didn't complain because it was just as good as our server said it was. One dish did not show up but we were so full that we let them know. They took it off our receipt, and apologized for overlooking it. If I lived in NYC, I'd be there all the time. It was clean and really good."
L O.,/user_details?userid=nMmlQHaRl17DQSSGwfO5Pg,"Manhattan, NY",8/31/2016,1,"Zero rating.  Awful experience.  Overpriced to begin with (3 dumplings in most orders) but service today has ensured that I will never order again.  My order took over an hour and fifteen minutes to arrive and when it did, it was incomplete.  We asked for a refund given the ridiculous delay and were told that only the one item that was delayed would be refunded and delivered separately.  After hearing from Seamless, the restaurant called back and was extremely rude to me, telling me that I was unreasonable and that I exaggerated the time.  They felt it was only appropriate to comp the item that was coming separately and became belligerent when I told them I didn't agree.  Needless to say, almost two and a half hours after my initial order, I have yet to receive the missing item and I obviously don't expect to.  I am sure the guy cancelled the redelivery after determining we would never do business together.  Extremely unprofessional."

Jessica M.,/user_details?userid=vFFzVH2tc3Y8iX-PM0xE1w,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/25/2023,5,It's been a while since our last visit but I am so glad we stopped by today. This family run business is so warm and inviting. They truly made us feel welcome and were very helpful in offering suggestions on what to order. My husband and I shared the bulgogi Korean bbq platter and a side kimchi stew. The bulgogi was nicely marinated and the side stew made me want to try their stews next time we visit. One thing to note is that the kimchi stew has a nice kick. If you don't like spicy foods try the miso stew instead. Serving sizes are generous and great for sharing. The kimchi is homemade and so good. What stood out were the owners' attention to customer service. They made sure to check in on all the tables for anything needed throughout the evening.

Service was great with the most l friendly staff! We ordered the seafood pancake which was our crack as well as a couple of stews and soups! Every dish was amazing and we left lethargic and stuffed!

We got the bulgogi fries, and I got the bulgogi entree and my bf got the pork belly ssam both of which came with a side soup. They gave us free fried potstickers as an appetizer and also had side dishes. Food was very good and came quick. The portion sizes are hugeeee!!!! We had leftovers enough for dinner. Especially the fries- it was a big hefty bowl. Service was friendly and I would def stop by for lunch again when I'm in the area."

Service was amazing, the restaurant is owned and operated by a Korean family who went above and beyond in their service for a table of 10. Since it was also my birthday, they were also so kind and kept wishing me a happy birthday, and they also brought out soju for the table. Their quality of service and food make this experience so special. Would definitely come back!"

The restaurant didn't feel too crowded and it was a good noise level to still comfortably maintain conversations. After getting seated, we were given some traditional banchan to split. I then ordered the dolsot bibimbop with beef, which was a very hearty portion that came in a sizzling hot stone bowl. The bibimbop was pretty good though the bulgolgi was somewhat dry and crumbly. Overall, it's still a solid wallet-friendly place to really fill up on some korean food."

My friend and I both ordered the pork belly, which came with white rice and a choice of soup, we both got the korean miso. The pork belly was really good, would recommend wrapping it with the lettuce that it comes with for the best taste! The soup was thicker than I thought, almost like the tofu soup that you usually get at places like 5 senses and BCD, but still good! Good lunch portions and came with all the little sides like kimchi, etc."

Amanda C.,/user_details?userid=6QlpAnPAqu8ax6R6JGdXzA,"Manhattan, NY",3/10/2022,4,"I made a reservation for a Tuesday evening at 6:15 pm. When I got here the restaurant was empty, except for one other party. The interior has these cute flower walls great for taking photos while you wait for your food. The server promptly came with our side dishes and hot tea and water. We got a few things. My favorite was probably the Bugolgi fries: served in a generous amount in a huge bowl. Beef was tender and marinated well. The budaejiggae was a little saltier for my preference, but it came with a bowl of rice to help with that. The spicy squid rice was also pretty good. It came with a generous serving of squid which was tender and seasoned with a spicy sauce. The chef also gave our table a free order of the fried dumplings which was a nice touch. By the time we left the tables were filling up. Seems like people come here more for the food than the happy hour."

The decor is very light colored and nice with lots of lighting and even greenery along walls. After I ordered, they gave me complimentary fried mandoos which were sooo frickin crunchy i love that sht its like they read my mind. Then they brought out the galbi jjim I ordered and wow the portion was hugeeee for one person. It came with some banchan, kimchi, and a bowl of rice too. As for the galbi jjim, that stew was TASTYYYY. It had great flavor being slightly sweet and the actual short ribs were maddddd tender and soft. This was my first time ever trying galbi jjim and I'm glad they broke my galbi jjim virginity :D"

We ordered the seafood pancake, the fried chicken wings (sweet and spicy sauce), the bulgogi kimchi French fries, the LA kalbi (comes with kimchi jjigae and rice), and the spicy squid rice. They also gave us complimentary dumplings which was nice. The portions were larger than I expected especially the bulgogi kimchi French fries. My favorite dishes were the fried chicken wings and the seafood pancake. The chicken wings were large, juicy, and the sauce had a good kick to it. The seafood pancake had a lot of seafood and was very crispy. The bulgogi kimchi French fries were tasty too since there was a lot of bulgogi. Service was fast and friendly. They didn't rush us like how it is in other restaurants in Koreatown. I would come back to try other dishes."

Jim T.,/user_details?userid=xkmU6tE9AWpQENfeTIaghA,"Manhattan, NY",12/16/2022,2,There is nothing special about this place.  A word of advice on your items with cheese... it is a good thought to use real cheese but don't let it turned the whole dish to be stuck together soon after getting to the table. How do you expect your customers to pick apart this cluster f*ck using only the cheap chopsticks provided?  Either use the correct type of cheese or give us forks and knives.
Diane Z.,/user_details?userid=lBIfa3INjAj_z2_amlnq3w,"Brooklyn, NY",7/24/2022,4,Great spot for lunch! I had the galbi lunch box and it was delicious and very filling. The seafood pancake was also really good!

Maxine T.,/user_details?userid=1No2XF4B3aUeQCXC2bUpOA,"Rochelle Park, NJ",6/6/2022,5,The soups are super filling and affordable. $14 for a spicy beef soup was so worth it!!

My favorite was the Doenjang Jjigae with the spicy option + beef. It had a spicy kick and a delicious soup which was perfect with the rice. The kimchi cheese fries were really good as well. Would definitely recommend the Doenjang Jjigae because of it's savory miso soup flavor. Comes with different meat + vegetarian option and either hot or mild flavor."

I never felt like our server was attending to us fully, and it was hard to get her attention. To be fair, I think they just opened up, and with the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm sure that also complicated things with staffing and what not. I didn't want to give a lower review because of this, so I looked past it. It just seems weird that we weren't given any water and we had to ask for it even though we were given little cups (which we poured our beer into). The kimchi fries were good, and I believe we also ordered a gyoza platter? I'm not too sure. When I'm back in New York, I'd like to eat here and dine outside."

The menu may seem condensed at first glance, since everything fits on a single side. However, don't let that fool you or make you hesitate when choosing a place to eat. There is a great variety of food available and even good vegetarian options on the menu. My partner and I ordered the seafood pancake, samgyupsal, galbi, and grilled mackerel. The spread was amazing and the food delicious. The soups that came with several of the dishes were served in nice stone dishes that kept them so warm and hot despite us not getting to them until later. The rice was served in a covered container that kept it warm and so amazing. We ate so much more than we expected. It was just so good. We got plenty of take out containers to take everything home in. Food is still as amazing the next day (ate it for breakfast). Definitely plan on going back."
Jiyoung L.,/user_details?userid=W2JllNh2Gz5yX_NUbbxUOg,"Atlanta, GA",3/9/2022,5,"Went there with little kids around 3-4pm. The staff and the owner were so attentive and caring for kids. I ordered YukGaeJang, Steamed mandoo and chicken skewers. They were all spot on with generous portions. Especially the dumplings seem to be handmade. The taste and quality were excellent. When I need a quick good Korean food, I will definitely come back."
Tay J.,/user_details?userid=Tq5jOddLJ8ra1qVWYNjpTg,"New York, NY",9/27/2021,4,"We were super pleasantly surprised by this restaurant and how big the portion sizes were. Be prepared to have leftovers! Our favorite item was the chicken skewer appetizer - the meat was so flavorful! Next time we go, well try to kimchi fries because they looked amazing (and HUGE!)."

Melissa C.,/user_details?userid=We-O8M6Ci9ieRj47D1Py6g,"Queens, Queens, NY",2/6/2022,5,"I went with a friend for restaurant week on a Thursday afternoon. The decor is beautiful and the service is amazing. My friend ordered the japchae for the appetizer, Mukuenji Samgyupsal Jjim for entrée, and chocolate cake for dessert. I ordered the fried dumplings for the appetizer, Osam Bulgogi for entrée, and cheesecake for dessert. The entrées came with a bowl of doenjang soup and a bowl of rice. This was way more than enough to fill us up and take home leftovers for dinner. The entrées were so delicious. I was so full but kept wanting to still eat more. This place had such good vibes and atmosphere. It was a great place to catch up and chill with a friend eating great food."

It's a family run business and all the staff provided great service and are very kind. We ordered one kimchi fried rice and one veggie tofu bibimbap.

Cat L.,/user_details?userid=AuaqlMKNTJuOxxaWUNvHMw,"New Orleans, LA",2/12/2022,4,First place I ate at in NYC today. We had bulgogi fries and bibimbop. Very tasty! The portions are large so I'm glad I shared the food with my boyfriend. Good service.
Sofia R.,/user_details?userid=PfTRrPZy-3d3o1zGtF9dWg,"San Francisco, CA",2/5/2022,5,Loved the chicken wings and fried calamari! Would highly recommend the LA chicken as well . The staff is super nice and the ambiance is very romantic and cool with nice music. Definitely recommend!!

Gordon B.,/user_details?userid=CPapPkMUJl4h3HdsFRJgmw,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",9/14/2021,2,"OVERRATED. The place charges prices I'd expect to pay for a real Korean BBQ in Koreatown, while the food here is more like fast food on pretty plates, nowhere near the standard set at real Korean BBQs. The bulgogi was served room temperature! The dumplings are perfectly cooked but bland. The kimchi has no pungency. It tastes to me like Korean food watered down for an American palate. The service was really nice, but they brought all our courses at the same time. Just as well; nothing was hot anyway. Meh."

Carrie F.,/user_details?userid=HD36U5aBrxVlImiUhGNV5w,"New York, NY",3/31/2021,5,Yum!!! Go here! They have such a cozy/festive outdoor dining hut with an awesome system where you press a call button when you want to order/need anything else. Very attentive and fast service. Everything we had was great. The little side dishes/banchan were so tasty. Loved the spicy pork BBQ which came with rice and soup (choice of kimchi or miso). And the bulgogi bibimbap came out sizzling. The spicy pork was so good I had to order another to bring home for my husband (and leftover lunch for me for tomorrow... I can't wait!) I'd come back here in a heartbeat.
Tiffany C.,/user_details?userid=y5iIZApFxcnqFtgb_otOOw,"Brea, CA",1/13/2021,5,"Mista Oh is a wonderful new spot for Korean authentic comfort foods. Especially in the cold weather, I was hoping for a filling and warm meal. Mista Oh has created a lovely outdoor space (3 tables of 4) with heaters and air filtration. There are call buttons for each table so staff can come outside when you need assistance. I ordered soondubu with beef and steamed mandu. My meal was fresh and came out hot. I was surprised that my food even came with complementary steamed egg that was mixed with some vegetables. My meal was so filling that I didn't even need to eat dinner and had leftovers. The prices were also reasonable. Highly recommend!"

The hospitality is beyond measure truly, you are served like a king and queen when you come here It's a must go to the food is delicious and to die for highly recommend the japchae was to die for lots of vegan and vegetarian options as well. Love love love it here please come whenever you can they opened about three weeks ago and I can't say enough positive things about it.

Ellen W.,/user_details?userid=TPUS85RkH9DH8AI3qlHl7g,"San Francisco, CA",2/17/2021,5,"This father-and-son operated Korean restaurant was such a delight for my brunch. Mackerel fish was perfectly grilled and seasoned, served on a bed of Asian chives and lemon wedges. As Korean-Californian, my kimchi bar is very high but their kimchi was like homemade,  perfectly fermented and not too salty. Kimchi stew was a little let down (a bit sweet) but still decent. I'm coming back to try their other things in menu."
Katherine L.,/user_details?userid=bvVHMLWN145hRJ6gcALipw,"Queens, Queens, NY",1/10/2022,5,"The employees made my group and I feel so welcome by being so courteous and immediately refilling whenever our water cups were empty. Additionally, I did not notify the restaurant I wanted to light up candles for my friends cake ( I recommend you let them know unlike me though LOL). It's because it was timing and I wanted to surprise my friend. Either way without even asking they supplied plates and forks! The food was delicious and a great representation of Korean Cuisine."

To add to out experience, the staff was so precious. Ran to hold the door open for us, came within seconds of knowing we needed something, and just overall so kind. The outdoor space is very cozy and comfortable as well. Definitely recommend and will be back for sure!"

Jonathan A.,/user_details?userid=mua49Jx_BDy76tfyEYv2pw,"Marietta, GA",5/20/2021,5,"I went to Koreatown, and sat down at a Korean restaraunt. Sure, it had korean ingredients, but the experience has been neutered from tradition. I get trying to do something new, and trendy; but if you take away the good parts of it it doesn't evolve the cuisine. Anyhow, I was curious about Mista Oh because it seemed like a. It of an outlier. It was a walk from Koreatown, but I felt like walking. Here, they maintain elements of tradition and also modernize it in a tasteful and effective manner. I was served banchan, korean appetizers/side dishes, and it was just a few items but still satisfying. The pork belly was succulent and cooked and seasoned well and the kimchi-jigae paired well with it. I left satisfied and appreciated the good service."

John P.,/user_details?userid=3SyS3t5Potc57xdt7TAK-g,"Queens, Queens, NY",7/6/2022,2,"Decided to give this restaurant a try tonight. Disappointed. I ordered their Kimchi Fried rice dish. I noticed on their website that they offer it with either Bulgogi beef or with vegetables.  When I arrived at the restaurant I looked at the menu and it only showed the Bulgogi and the menu once had a Shrimp option but that was crossed out directly on their menu.  I inquired to the server and she said oh yes we do offer it with Vegetables.  I then asked what type of veggies and she replied ""assorted ' veggies.  I proceed to order it. Once it arrived it had no veggies other than diced scallion which is just a Garnish and not assorted vegetables.  I then asked shouldn't it come with a fried egg on top and she replied oh since you got the veggie Kimchi fried rice I assumed you don't want egg.  I am a vegetarian not a vegan. There is a big difference!   Only vegans don't eat eggs.  She said oh well.  I paid $18.99 for a bowl of rice.  Totally disappointed and would never recommend this place to any of NY friends"

The service and food were all delicious. Every single thing we got was so good. My favorite two dishes were actually the sesame crusted salmon and the crab cakes. We also got the cheese fries which were a good side and the portions were quite large. The uni filet minion was so yummy and the steak melted in your mouth. The salmon roe and seaweed sauce were so savory and complimented the steak well. It was definitely pricey ($192) but the portion size is large and you can definitely share it with another person.

For the main entrees, we ordered the Prime Wagyu Steak which was A5 Wagyu beef with ponzu sauce and various condiments on the sides (sea salt, garlic chips, wasabi, and schezwan peppercorns). Steak was beautifully cooked.  Additionally, we ordered lamb chops with a hollandaise sauce and miso mille feuille potato. Definitely great for a special event or date night."
Leorna L.,/user_details?userid=tmr4qwCcYClCyxtVUCUREw,"New York, NY",4/3/2023,1,"We were excited to try it. A friend was a repeat customer. Ordered the most premium steaks and uni toppings with a tab over $500, was really disappointed in food, really underwhelming steak, bland flavor and shockingly lacked salt completely for them. Would not go back"

The server was very thorough in explaining how to eat the meat with the different pairings. We ended up loving the filet most, will be recommending to friends and family to come for special occasions. Certainly a splurge but well worth it"

Yaqi Y.,/user_details?userid=ZWRZMQh3avx8Ou_NT9Zrug,"Brooklyn, NY",7/16/2022,4,"Just got back from this cute spot in Williamsburg for a nice evening out. Ordered the NY strip (14oz) , market fish which was a whole branzino, and side of shishito peppers. Overall, delicious meal and would recommend for a nice date or a group dinner. Staff was nice and attentive to refilling our glass. The branzino was moist and flavorful.  Shishito pepper was Amazing! It was definitely salted & charcoaled; had a great smoky flavor. NY strip was done as requested medium well, however the ""side"" of watercress was bland. Not sure if it was meant as a garnish or actually meant as a side salad. Considering the steak was still, a simple dressing drizzled over the watercress would've sealed the deal for me. The only other annoying thing was the 2.7% credit usage fee which was not mentioned prior until the bill came. So bring cash, if you do decide to come!"
Nathaniel L.,/user_details?userid=8BW5kTldkUdL1foSRvywNg,"Queens, NY",12/4/2022,4,"Ordered everything. Overall, tasted wonderful. Fries were mediocre, drinks were average. Not a knock, but it doesn't smell or feel like a traditional steakhouse if that's the vibe you were looking for. Doors on both sides of the restaurant were open, so there was a lot of street noise. And also someone who threw a container of water at our table in a hit and run. Luckily our orders didn't arrive yet, but the server just gave us extra napkins. Good ol' NYC. Overall solid, but unlikely to come back given the price point."

Overall the food was decent but it wasn't wow-Ing or spectacular in my opinion. Starting with the appetizers, the crunchy oysters was very refreshing. It's a must order. Their wagyu sushi, salmon rolls, and uni and wagyu sushi is also delicious. Moving onto the steak entrees, I was a little disappointed at how the steaks came out because it was barely warm when it was served to our table. My friends and I came on a Sunday night at 9pm. It wasn't too busy so I'm not sure why our steaks came out disappointing. The duck breast was uncooked to our tasting. Overall, salt + charcoal is worth trying but not the best to me and my friends."

We wanted to order the steak tartare as well but unfortunately we were not able to do so because there was no sushi chef to prepare it for the day. The baked potato was alright, nothing special about it. The star of the show was the steak. I would recommend getting the steak when you come here!"

We had 5 people sitting indoors down in the wine cellar at the best table the round table booth. We shared the lobster, steak for 3 and the following sides - special vegetables, onion and cheese fries. I would say onion and cheese fries is a must to get. The one item I would like to see expanded is the wine lists as it was lacking on selection and maybe this is because of the extensive sake offering. I opted for a cocktail or two instead and they were great - try the salt + charcoal cocktail."

I am going to order the steak next time and of course the cheese fried. Their desserts are good also.

The steak tartare was interesting as it was mixed with a sweet sauce.  Then I had the porterhouse and cheese fries.  Needless to say, I was stuffed at the end of dinner but was extremely satisfied with everything. Oh yeah, and the service was great."

The host showed us to our table which was ready on time. We had a birthday cake and it was stored nicely until the end of our meal. The best dishes were the cheese fries, porter house with lobster, and crab cake. Note that Salt and Charcoal is an upscale Japanese steakhouse. There was wasabi in many of the dishes and I do not like wasabi. If you do, you will enjoy their dishes with wasabi sauces. The wagyu was not great, unfortunately too dry, and I thought as a Japanese steakhouse and for $225 it would be perfected."

Do yourself a favor and get the edamame and the porterhouse (mid rare) and skip the grilled vegetables/broccoli and baked onion (unless you enjoy mushy vegetables then don't let me stop you)

I've been twice and tried almost everything. My favorite item is the filet mignon and the wagyu steak with their fries. I also enjoyed their crab cake. However, be prepared to wait a long time for the mains/steaks to come out. Probably took about 30 min each time for the mains to come out."

Total I think was $130 (excluding tip) for tuna tartare, NY steak, miso soup, and veggies. Giving it 1 star less because the steak took 1 hour and 45 mins to arrive at the table. I understand staffing shortages but to keep it brief - I had a pretty rough flight coming to the city and I took a nap at the table and my steak still didn't arrive lol."

The fish was good. It comes with herb butter, ponzu sauce, and we were served an orange slice to compliment the dish...Japanese style, I guess."

david l.,/user_details?userid=74eE-jgCGO24YKIci38UcQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/27/2021,4,Overall a great meal and great service. Steaks are dry aged in house. They are busrting with flavor and super tender. Things I think they can improve on is seasoning. Everything was just slightly under seasoned from the steak to the herb butter. The roasted potatoes was topped with a bit to much herb butter. The Waygu Tartare lacked any flavor. I've never had Japanese Waygu but I understand it to not have a intense beef flavor however the tartare was bland. The perfectly aged steaks made up for the slight misses
Blossom C.,/user_details?userid=PLE8EVCDJD-99Hx6W576sw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/6/2021,4,"Came here on a Saturday night and sat outdoors. Very cozy and warm despite the chill outside and there was an option to turn on the heater we had next to us but we didn't need it. We started off with three appetizers, the wagyu uni, shishito peppers and the crab cake. Out of all three, we loved the crab cake the most! Would definitely order that again. We had the 30 day Porterhouse for two and it was cooked just right, Medium Rare. The herb butter it came with was delicious as well as the side sauces."
G P.,/user_details?userid=GQTHPF9ZalxjhNOfl8pxMw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",5/28/2022,4,"Cool place with tasty food. The wait staff was really nice. The food menu is small, so if you're looking for many options do not come here. The porterhouse steak for two was delicious. The cheese fries are good. The baked potato was a little messy, but the flavor was nice. I believe they used a wasabi butter on it. I think the drinks were sake based because they weren't strong at all. The miso sauce for the crunch oyster was also very tasty."

They even came to us and offer free dessert because our fries came little late. I was very surprised how generous and sweet they are! I definitely recommend their ny steak crunchy oyster cheese fries and also uni waygu beef was all very delicious. I also really move that wasabi creamy sauce!

It was obvious that our server was new but was adorable and attentive. It's pricy but honestly worth it. The filet mignon melts in your mouth and the sushi was really good."

Wayne B.,/user_details?userid=acKodIRkDnuMa4H1Ri-MLg,"Brooklyn, NY",2/12/2022,2,"The food qualitatively speaking was so so. The porterhouse for 2 was fatty and not the choicest cut. The salad wedge was tasty. The salmon sushi roll did not taste to be the freshest.  The green tea matcha cake with vanilla ice cream was the best of everything served along with the green tea. Only 3 desserts listed on menu. The matcha became a bit cloying by the third bite though. Hip Williamsburg vibe. No one over 40 here. All getting a jump start to clogged arteries. Service was attentive but nothing  special.  Nice big square ice cube in my Manhattan cocktail,  which helped my drink taste good. All this mediocrity doesn't come cheap.  About $300 for everything."
Yunique C.,/user_details?userid=RgWJJ0oUdszw2qjkTud07Q,"Flushing, Queens, NY",9/5/2021,4,"First of all, this restaurant definitely not $$, they should correct it to $$$ restaurant. Appetizers was pretty good. Just the porter house size is smaller than what we expect. One side is sirloin, the other side is filet mignon, it was pretty disappointed that the sirloin side have 1/3 of tendon. Other than that.. the flavor was good tho."
Gus L.,/user_details?userid=AjbkOG2ssIwvKW-YUAcuyw,"Queens, Queens, NY",10/20/2022,5,Amazing food and our waiter was great.

During my 5th time here for dinner, we ordered the usual porterhouse, side baked potatoes, side organic grilled veggies, two glasses of red wine, and the matcha cake and a Manhattan to end the delicious meal. The service is still great, quality of food is phenomenal, and we still think Salt + Charcoal is underrated. We love that it's low key, chill, and cozy - the atmosphere brings us back whether it's a hot summer day or a winter snowy evening. And the flavors... I mean, wasabi cream + yuzu on steak... heaven! Go here. You won't regret it! And you'll likely prefer it over Peter Luger and other famous NYC steakhouses."

Jeffrey J.,/user_details?userid=CLqJqgOKtxlw7apxOxB1hw,"Brooklyn, NY",2/22/2022,5,Wow!? The flavors deliver. I'm pleasantly pleased with the Japanese flair. The sushi options and the beef cuts deliver. This imconcept is done very well.
Jackie M.,/user_details?userid=GSpVa6eQVeX-DxG7knlVoQ,"Brooklyn, NY",9/23/2021,5,"So good. Porterhouse cooked medium was just the way we like it. Cheese fries were INSANE but very good. Just would suggests ordering them if party is larger than two as we had a hard times digging through them. And the baked potato I HIGHLY recommend. Service was the best part, however."

Ken K.,/user_details?userid=pg4FWoL3n6nEs61v7c7BXw,"New York, NY",10/11/2020,3,While the food here was delicious it was completely overshadowed by the face that the total meal experience took 2 and a half hours. When you eat at a more expensive place like this you expect service and the experience to be good.  From the time we got our appetizers to the time we got our dinner it was well over an hour. The funny part was our steaks were warm but the duck and lamb chops were ice cold. I would have loved this place if I didn't end up eating so late and was so frustrated by deals with really no legitimate reason. Not sure if I will ever be back because of it.
Malik D.,/user_details?userid=w4w932mjBx-aq3bpMHjxLA,"Massapequa, NY",8/11/2022,2,"Literally just salt and charcoal. Food was extremely bland and flavorless. I was referee by a coworker and went lay minute. Turned out to be a huge disappointment. Service was great. I could have did without having to keep swatting away the drain flies. Lobster had zero seasoning, I didn't even taste butter. Even Waygu was disappointing which I never thought possible. The staff was great but for me it was a big waste."

I honestly think the space outside is more spacious then the inside space! The waiters were very polite and helpful. They definitely were trying to sell us on drinks as much as possible. We chose to sit next to the curb - but many of the seats were very distanced which was very nice. They had a good blend of american food like steaks and duck and a good amount of sushi and sashimi. I got the sashimi and my friend got the duck. Both were equally delicious. I saw that the sushi that other tables got were HUGE. The japanese food comes with freshly grated wasabi and they had very nice complimentary mixes of sauces.

The drinks were  worth the price because of the presentation alone, but they're also well made. The presentation for the food displayed that the chef truly know what it meant to eat with your eyes first. Everything from the cheese fries and broccoli to the expensive (but worth every dollar) steak made our mouths water. We will be coming back and will be bringing friends and family to have the same great dining experience that we had."

I love and appreciate a good Japanese steakhouse and sushi! My friend and I shared the New York strip steak and it was cooked to perfection (medium rare). My friend has celiac (gluten-free) and they were extremely accommodating with this in putting all the sauces on the side, omitting the tempura flakes on our sushi roll (albacore roll-- not pictured because it was so good we ate it too fast to take one) and even had gluten free soy sauce for her. The wagyu, uni roll was amazing as well. It was like a build your own hand roll and the flavors of the the two items together was just spectacular! Our server was phenomenal and we will definitely be returning! Thank you Salt + Charcoal!"

Charlie K.,/user_details?userid=IOolXA_22efa3VJ15I6c1A,"Queens, NY",11/8/2021,2,It's alright I guess but for $400 meal much better options elsewhere that doesn't make you wait two hours for a rather simple porterhouse steak to come out. Perhaps they were understaffed but not even a word? Sushi is actually very good  for a steakhouse but also took an hour half to come out. Service needs attention.

I ordered the Tuna tartar and the dry aged NY steak. It was all absolutely  amazing. The steak is the best I have had in NY, that says a lot. With the herb butter topping i took a long time to enjoy every bite. After dinner I sat at the bar and drank a Japanese whisky version of an old fashion. The best ever! The bartender seemed to take great care to extract the best flavors from the fresh ingredients, with a big cube of ice I also enjoyed every sip. I will be back. If your are a local, or a traveler, this is a do not miss on the restaurant list."

We started off with the wagyu sushi, and also got the shrimp crunch, and the 36oz porterhouse steak. The wagyu sushi was okay, we didn't like it but that may just be us because we're not used to eating raw meat. The shrimp crunch was SO good, definitely recommend it. It was fresh, spicy, crunchy, simply delicious. Now the porterhouse, phenomenal. It came out sizzling hot, perfectly juicy and well seasoned. The lemon butter on it was so tasty. Lastly for dessert we got the matcha cake. One of my favorites as well. It was creamy with the perfect matcha flavor that wasn't too little or too much. It went beautifully with the vanilla ice cream. Their pineapple cocktail is also really really good, highly recommend. Staff was so friendly and attentive, service was great. Can't wait to go back, it was a lovely experience."

We dined in on a Tuesday evening and we were seated right away. The place is small but I liked that as it made the dining experience intimate and cozy. We didn't order any appetizers apart from drinks. The shiso mojito and the salt/charcoal drinks were sweet, strong and refreshing. We ordered the duck entree as well as the New York strip which came with a lemon butter sauce. Although I enjoyed the steak, I don't think it needed the butter but nonetheless the steak was soo tender, juicy and it hit the spot. The duck was also super tasty and the potatoes it came with complimented it well. Everything just tasted like it was made with care and of quality ingredients and the prices were more than reasonable. See you soon!"
Monica P.,/user_details?userid=PYU55GS49zUD_u4GJ_jVIQ,"Brooklyn, NY",6/28/2021,2,"Don't get me wrong, the food can be good here but the service is truly appalling. This has been my second time here, once during the first year opened and second time was the other week. First time I remembered the service could've been better and was very meh, second time was flat out terrible. Reservations were at 9 but we didn't get seated until 9:15. Once they seated us, you would think they cared to ATLEAST ask if we want some water for the table right away like ANY normal place would normally do. But no, we sat there for exactly a whole 30 minutes with no one checking in on us one bit let alone having water on the table!! After the half hour, we had to get up and look for our waiter for his attention in which he replied in such a rude manner!! Yet he still did not service us right away after we had to come up to him. 45 minutes later, and he finally came to take our order!!! RIDICULOUS, with no genuine sincere apology. We were absolutely starving at that rate so we even ordered 2-3 cocktails with him right away knowing that their service would be slow all night just from that start as well as all of our food. Told them it doesn't have to wait for it all to be ready to come to our table or which order whether if entree or appetizer came first... to just fire it all up since we were just so hungry at that rate. But no, the food took awhile to come, and it all just came together. It was so hard to even enjoy the food after being so upset. I remember the first time I ate here I really enjoyed the filet mignon with uni however, the beef and tuna tartares as well as some other dish that is not on the menu this time. Never again will I come here"

Tuna tartare was on point, love the fact that you make your own hand rolls. They have a great selection of steak and it could get pricey, but even their least expensive option the New York Strip was delicious and filling for 2 (the charred fatty pieces are the best part ;)) I ordered some Uni, which is the best I've ever tasted (not a big uni person because it's an acquired taste, and I finally acquired it after eating here (not too salty or slimey & tasted great with the steak)). Also had the cheese fries which were delicious."
Edward Y.,/user_details?userid=4XPMBTguew4wmoR0Kb7AKw,"Alameda, CA",11/9/2021,2,"My partner and I were looking forwards to trying out the Filet Mignon with Uni, but alas, they were out of uni by 8p.m.  Really a shame since that was the only reason I had picked this place to go to. We then opted for the 14oz strip steak since we were already here, but it was at best, average. While we thought it was moderately tender and had some flavor, it didn't really stand out. My partner thought the soy lemon onion sauce was the saving grace for it.  Maybe it was the lingering disappointment, but we didn't exactly enjoy ourselves here."

Jane H.,/user_details?userid=JDtDZAheLQ8WZWcFgBOAqQ,"Brooklyn, NY",10/27/2020,4,"I took my boyfriend to Salt + Charcoal for his birthday. We were seated outside, and although it didn't have the cutest decor, the service and food made up for it. Our waitress was really attentive and sweet but our meal felt a little rushed, possibly due to it being a busy night? Unsure but they were coming to grab our plates pretty quickly even when we weren't finished. For an expensive dinner like this one, I would've expected to be able to savor my meal. Anyway, on to the food! We started with the truffle chawanmushi which was light but flavorful. We also had the fried oysters which I thought were so juicy! I saw people raving about the wagyu tartare so we got that but I would probably skip this next time. The wagyu was unfortunately overpowered by the noodles it came with. The wagyu uni sushi would've probably been a better choice. My absolute favorite was the uni filet mignon - worth the splurge! They are generous with the uni and it is definitely enough to share for two. Being the child I am, I also ordered the cheese fries which were thin and crispy just the way I like them. Great place to celebrate a special occasion!"

Fionn L.,/user_details?userid=sR2GyBcbDkLzCSDB_Cee8w,"Oakland Gardens, NY",9/23/2021,2,"Food was not bad but definitely not worth it for the price! 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 2 drinks and the total was $750  I get high quality food and restaurants but the restaurant had more of a super relaxed and laid back vibe and the food definitely did not match the price. Customer service was fine, but for that price I would definitely not come back and go to another place"

Rachel T.,/user_details?userid=Y3uPto9AFvqzC7Hntfto4g,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",12/5/2020,5,Went to Salt + Charcoal about 2 years ago and again recently with friends and both times have been just amazing. A cozy intimate restaurant in Williamsburg that brings a lot of flavor and quality food. Their charcoal grilled edamame and cheese fries are great! All the sushi was very fresh and the 30 day dry aged porterhouse was perfect. I loved the uni wagyu roll and tuna tartare (which is freshly made at the table). The Japanese Prime Wagyu is literally perfection if you really want to splurge. Highly recommend Salt + Charcoal!
Christine Z.,/user_details?userid=C_pDwVcYk5fBjB5PxqkfPQ,"San Francisco, CA",9/21/2019,4,"Great streak grilled to perfection. Ordered New York strip steak, it was . It was 14 oz, but I can finish it all! The sauce is not a highlight actually, it didn't add much more flavor to the steak  as I think."
Rachel N.,/user_details?userid=evUdxhPnsyN_a2bvynPVAg,"New York, NY",7/15/2022,2,"We used to love Salt + Charcoal but the service has become terrible. We placed a pickup order on a Tuesday evening recently, and the estimated pickup kept increasing. Eventually, the estimated pickup climbed to 10:30 pm - more than an hour later than originally estimated. We kept trying to call the restaurant to find out what was going on and being put on hold for 5+ minutes with no one ever coming back onto the phone to talk to us. We finally just went to the restaurant in person because we were starving and had no idea what was going on. The guy at the counter didn't seem to care that it had now been over an hour since we placed our pickup order and told us to just cancel it because it would be a ""very very long time"" before it was ready.  He also refused to seat us so we could just eat there in person, despite the restaurant being mostly empty. We had to cancel the order on DoorDash and then waste more time contacting DoorDash to get a refund processed because Salt + Charcoal wouldn't do anything on their end to communicate that the cancellation was not our fault. I tried to reach out to the restaurant about this by email afterwards and never received a reply. I love the food here, but Salt + Charcoal clearly doesn't care about service so we unfortunately won't be coming back."

Elijah E.,/user_details?userid=QMNCHGrFNVyFkY3ARxtarg,"South Orange, NJ",9/4/2021,5,"This was my second time dining at Salt + Charcoal and I'm even more impressed the second time. I had the pleasure of celebrating my 25th birthday here 2 years ago and it was superb. From the Baked Potatoes to the various dipping sauces. And the Porterhouse; one of the best steaks in my life. Cooked to absolute perfection. The first time I visited it was 48 Day aged, and the latter time only 30. No matter, it was just as tender and flavorful as the first time. The customer service is always A1. We wanted to try something a little different after having a lot of hard liquor before we arrived so our waiter recommended we try S+C's signature cocktails which were perfect. Aside from the food and drinks, S+C is one of those smaller niche spots, which is perfect for me and my friends, but don't expect to have a huge dinner here. It's tailored to smaller groups looking for a more intimate setting. The outside seating reminds me of one of those Little Italy mafia hangouts, minus the tacky tablecloths. I mention this spot to anyone I know who enjoys a good steak. A must-have in Williamsburg. I'll be back soon."

Qingyang X.,/user_details?userid=9m0pkGMTzIDMuBx9iqu9Ng,"East Lansing, MI",10/6/2020,3,I guess consistency can be one of the criteria. Last year the uni filet was much larger.

Maria G.,/user_details?userid=alON41uDAUjGguZzksR3yA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/5/2020,5,"I can't say enough about this spot, I really love the combination of the finer things: a great steak + sushi. Salt + Charcoal has the best combinations of both with their offerings of uni & steak via their rolls as well as entrees. Your meal can be customized to be as luxurious as you desire. They have great outdoor seating as well! Perfection!"

Peter P.,/user_details?userid=gpRQA14EEXmutOFMEP2zhw,"Brooklyn, NY",11/24/2021,2,"The food was good, but for the price we paid I wish we didn't have to sit outside in the freezing cold. I understand outdoor dining is the new thing in NYC, but when the bill is over $200 I don't think I should be eating in 30 degree weather with a puny heat lamp hanging over my head. I made a reservation for two and there was no indication it would be outdoor seating. Expensive food should be eaten in a comfortable environment. I walked out of the restaurant very disappointed."

The lamb chops were ok, no flavor and super fatty for $50 it was a really small cut as well. I give this place a two due to the service, it was so bad. We waited over 20 min just for water on a hot day. The servers are standing around, we told the manager twice we were waiting on water and she just stood there passing the message on but never really doing anything. We were only 3 people. It took forever to get the food, I had to ask the busser for everything, the service was lacking terribly. The drinks were ok but for the hefty price this was not worth the experience."

Taheefa S.,/user_details?userid=xUl9ugLVt-4jnRrSNJmEpw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/17/2020,4,"This place will honestly make you commit all kind of savory sins... I mean if your salivary glands are working properly, you're in trouble coming here.  I went here on a date with my boyfriend and got carried away literally (and physically :-p) my taste buds were wowed with every bite! From the appetizer down to the entree even the still fancy WATER, YES THE $9 bottle water of Saratoga! It was awesome and so fresh, everything! I looked at the menu and reviews prior to going and I still wasn't ready for the amazement I was about to encounter. For the appetizer we ordered the Salt + Charcoal Crab Cake, it was too divine. It honestly can be a mini meal, it was shared sized portion to tenderize your palate for everything that was about to come. It was delectable even with the garnish salad and wasabi cream sauce on which it was plated. Everything went really well together! For the entree, we did the shared 50 day Jyukusei Porterhouse Steak Steak for two. For sides, cheese fries, grilled broccoli and baked potatoes. Now it was massive! It was definitely a portion made for 2 (or more-they also have for 3 the steak portion). The steak was prepared upon request as medium well. AND WELL IT WAS! Honestly, it was melt in your mouth steak. Not much chewing required.  Just typing this review all over again I want to revisit. The cheese fries I'd say I can skip for the next time because the cheese got cold and wasn't as enjoyable because we were so focused on the other foods we forgot about that mundane order lol. The cheese fries were good but the steak, those sauces and those potatoes was the star of the night! I was stuffed after that meal! There was no way you wouldn't be stuffed. I want to be stuffed some more so some way some how I will be finding my way back to this steakhouse!"

Met a friend here for dinner. Very cozy and intimate space with low lighting and a fridge full of aged meat in the front. Was greeted by a very friendly waitress (Kiome). We started off with some lychee martinis, grilled octopus and edamame, which Kiome said was cooked with some secret oil. Both were delicious! The octopus was flavorful and we were given two large tentacles, and the edamame wasn't just all talk. The secret oil was in fact delightful. We shared the 14oz 50 day aged NY Strip. The steak itself was amazing. We got the grilled veggies (apparently from finger lakes), which honestly we probably could've done without (16$ for grilled veggies seems a little steep). Overall excellent food and presentation. Service was great, I would come back to try to wagyu."

We got a porterhouse for 3.  I could have had a steak 10 times better at home. Very tough, couldn't even chew it. The only reason it didn't get one star was the salad and tar tar was good. I won't even fault them for the lack of seafood, things happen, i get that. Service was terrible, table was terrible. Sat next to a screaming child.

Stacey J.,/user_details?userid=MILzeGI0hWbYmPneKhJXrQ,"Queens, NY",3/28/2021,1,"Only come if you have all day to spare(waiting for the food). We had a birthday dinner reservation at 8:15pm, food didn't come until close to 11pm and the restaurant closes at 10pm. I can understand maybe like 30-1 hr waiting time for our food to arrive since it's a Saturday night but no, especially at a ""high end "" restaurant. Nobody should ever wait over 2 hours for their food. Reading other reviews about how the steak made up for the wait... unfortunately it did not. They served us our sides first, that was supposed to be eaten with our main course, then main course came after the sides which baffles me. We ordered porterhouse for 3, medium. It was over cooked and a lot of fatty pieces that you can't even eat. The steak was very chewy and has a lot of muscle fibers in it, making it even harder to chew. Wagyu sushi($24 for 2 pieces) lacked any taste, literally tasted like a piece of garlic. Forgot 2 of the drinks we ordered. We were extremely excited since there are so many good reviews here, but the waiting is no joke and that really take your appetite away. This is not acceptable. The only good thing was the whiskey my bf ordered, that's about it. They did apologize for the wait but it seems like it's a norm here. If you want good quality steak, don't go here. If you want good sushi, don't go here. Only come here if you have the time to wait, like a long catch up session with a friend you haven't seen in ages. There's no reason for steak and sushi to be served over 2 hours late, I mean come on, it's steak and sushi, not braised short ribs. Anyway, super disappointed and will never step afoot in here again. Just a regular restaurant that wants to be fake fancy with its steep price. Saying sorry doesn't change anything, making changes to your mistakes does. Start making real changes if you want patrons to come again."

Elisa L.,/user_details?userid=g9fjLYcofmILyfr7XrrrNQ,"Manhattan, NY",9/14/2020,5,"I have been wanting to come here for a while now and am so glad I finally stopped by. We dined outside since indoor dining is still not back yet. The staff all wore masks and tables were fairly distanced. We started with the wagyu beef uni hand rolls which I actually thought was the wagyu beef tartare because of some of the pictures& captions on yelp but I'm so glad I ordered the wrong thing because these hand rolls were amazing! It was a little over $30 for two pieces but those two pieces left me wanting more! We had to resist since we still had the uni filet mignon coming out. As we waited for our main dish, our waiter brought out some chips for us to munch on. I didn't think the filet mignon would that big so we added some lamb chops. The entrees and the cheese fries came out at the same time which made a really nice full table picture for Instagram but as we began to eat our fries got cold and the cheese wasn't as melted as they looked in the pic. The uni filet mignon was so delicious (I'm drooling for more while posting these pictures). On the menu, it is M.P. for market price. The wait staff will gladly tell you the market price when you order. I ordered without asking and our waiter informed me the price before proceeding with my order. The market price that day for us was around $160 and it was worth every dollar. Overall it was a very great dinner and will definitely be back to try the wagyu beef tartare along with more hand rolls and uni filet mignon!"
Peta W.,/user_details?userid=LIUG2DEFFnldM-mcw2GhaA,"Bronx, NY",1/12/2020,5,"I'm totally in love with this place. I made a reservation and was running late, called in and they accommodated. Arrived in between the time and got seated at a cute table for two. I felt like we needed more space so we asked to move to a booth and they accommodated. The atmosphere and service was amazing. The food was amazing. I had the fish of the day grilled and you get the whole thing. Charred broccoli with sauces. The presentation was everything. I think it's my new favorite place in that location. I absolutely love the minimalist healthy approach to how the food is prepared."

Not only the dishes were perfect, I was impressed by the house drinks too. I stopped by to ask some questions to the bartender and he was the nicest guy. His multitasking is impressive, as he was keeping a chat with me he was still focused in his multiple tasks. Sometimes I couldn't hear him because of the mask and he was super patient repeating the information. Too bad the bar area is not open. My partner and I love to socialize with new people when we go out. Service always ready and really good attention overall. Beautiful ambientance. I'm definitely coming back. Thank you S+C!!!"
Melissa C.,/user_details?userid=I0iBeu1l762Qc4kQRqGu0w,"Columbia, MO",10/31/2019,5,"I had been researching for a couple weeks now what places had the best wagyu and this is what I decided on. We got the cheese fries and the 8 oz Japanese wagyu steak. In other photos the steak seemed smaller for such a large price tag but it was perfect! It literally melted in your mouth like butter, one of the coolest experiences of my life. Not only that, the restaurant was not too Japanese oriented if you prefer a steakhouse style restaurant. the fries were amazing and service was great, we got complimentary candies and dried lotus chips. Any time we ran out of something the server immediately helped us out. He throughly explained what anything was too! All in all, both the service and food was up to par, if not better!"

Yolanda J.,/user_details?userid=rTimxfuIh4A73s4BBYN-bg,"City of Orange, NJ",12/17/2019,5,The best steak in NYC. They have several sauce options which makes the steak 10x better. I tried the porterhouse steak and crab cakes and it is the most flavorful steak I've had(better then del frisco) but that's just my opinion. It's the perfect place for a first date the setting and ambiance deff sets the mood.
Rachel Michelle Q.,/user_details?userid=o_Z4AVPfZuSUxhvuf--Vxw,"Brooklyn, NY",10/9/2019,5,"If this place could get 20 stars, i would give it to them. This was our first time there and the food was absolutely incredible. We walked in and were greeted immediately. This place is on the smaller scale, which makes it more intimate. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and super attentive. We got our drinks within a few mins of ordering and then apps and main course. Definitely would come here again. It's a hidden gem."
Matt J.,/user_details?userid=VMrwi0NghKw6SA8fqMI24Q,"Brooklyn, NY",11/3/2020,4,"Expensive but definitely worth it! Really high quality steak with a smashed potato, the smoked duck breast and a table side mixing of tuna tartar are our favorites."
Jamie L.,/user_details?userid=vC_29mSPl6WiHNyqp8oTJQ,"West Hempstead, NY",12/8/2019,5,I had a different experience of Japanese cuisine here. Uni & wagyu roll and wagyu + black truffle were very impressive. Definitely wanna come back again.

I've been wanting to try this place forever and I finally got a chance during quarantine. If you wanna treat yourself during quarantine order togo from here! It was the best meal I have had in months hands down! The steaks are unbelievable! Get that potato too, it's out of this world. Pro tip, ask for truffle oil! The broccoli was cooked perfectly. The edamame is the best edamame I have ever had in my life, who knew grilling edamame was a thing and it kicks up the flavor 100 %. The sushi rolls we tried were also amazing, so fresh and flavorful. You can tell the chefs here really pay attention to detail and put care in the food they are making. I recently visited Japan and this was definitely like being back there. If you wanna pretend you're on vacation in Japan definitely order from here, you won't regret it. Can't wait to dine in when things open back up. Thank you Salt and Charcoal"

This was one of the best meals I had in New York.

Salt + Charcoal has been on my list of restaurants to visit but I never made the time to trek all the way to Williamsburg - boy were we impressed! We primarily chose this restaurant to try the wagyu steak served with a bed of uni on top. This entree did not disappoint. It was super decadent and rich but the steak balanced everything out. It was also served with ikura eggs on tops and a bed of veggies below. We also ordered the tuna tartare. We really liked the presentation of them bringing all of the ingredients to our table, combining everything and mixing the ingredients in front of us. For sides we also ordered the broccoli with hollandaise sauce and cheesy fries. Our waitress was awesome! Very sweet and helpful and since she knew we were celebrating for a special occasion, she even brought out complimentary ice cream for us to share!"

It was very quiet so it was very easy to have a conversation. The waiters and waitresses were very kind. As we looked at the menu for a few minutes, We ordered the Wagyu Yukke Tartare, Assorted Sashimi of the day and 50 Day Jyukusei New York Strip Steak. As we tried each delicious dish in order it was a great experience. Even though it is on the pricey side I would recommend giving this place a try. The wagyu tartare was delicious with the seaweed. The sashimi of the day was fresh and The steak came out a perfect medium rare. The sauces that came out with the steak were delicious. The lemon butter melted on the steak and it made the steak even more delicious."

Maxi L.,/user_details?userid=c3ctd-erq8O6lFXslPiRzw,"New York, NY",5/30/2019,4,We came here to celebrate our anniversary. We started with fried oysters and Uni sashimi. Both were good/small  and not filling. We decided to share the Uni fillet mignon as the main dish because we would probably eat again later on. The waiter was phenomenal! Service was excellent! He told us in advance the cut would take about 45 mins to prepare and it would be a good idea to pick out the main course first if we decided to choose steak as an option. We did however waited about an hour+ they  gave us some complimentary lotus chips while we were waiting but it was really taking a long time. We did see a lot of the porter house cut being ordered and we would love to try that next time! The steak finally came and Uni was amazing as always! The fillet mignon cut was very thick to my surprise and it was a great portion to share. But the meat was a bit chewy. It wasn't that soft butter cut that I expected. We asked for medium rare too so I was a bit disappointed. When we saw all of those porter house steaks I thought to myself did we order the wrong item. Because it seemed like we were the only table eating the Uni fillet mignon. But anyway we will be back to try something else.

Ken W.,/user_details?userid=i9rSEGxwXVwM8-DbLkqP0w,"Forest Hills, NY",1/4/2020,4,"The preparation for the tuna tartare was scrupulous, from initially presenting the dish's constituents to mixing it at the table.  Everything was fresh, including the wasabi to the delicate tuna.  The truffle roll was extremely decadent, with the shavings pairing with an additional oil to give each piece an extra kick of umami-ness.  The crab cake was sensational with its accompanying wasabi cream sauce.  The porterhouse's dry-aged quality shown through in the flavor's richness, but the meat appeared to be a touch overdone and was somewhat tougher than expected.  However, the selection of sauces helped to elevate the meat.  The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and tender, with complex tasting pieces of potato underneath.  The baked onion among the grilled veggies was surprisingly good, redolent of artichoke hearts.  The service was exceptional throughout; in addition, the matcha cake dessert was decorated with an apropos birthday message after I had indicated the dinner's purpose in my Yelp reservation details."

While eating here there was an asian woman with somewhat revealing clothes on. I over heard a tall, skinny, Japanese man who I assume is the owner or manager say to an employee ""Women who dress like that are just asking to be Rap*d hehehe"" and then went on to make a derogatory comment about Chinese people. Like WTF!? Are you serious? It's no wonder the only woman working in the restaurant is the hostess, they probably all quit because of this man. I've seen at least two other bad reviews about this guy on here. I could never come back here again and have to see this guy's face."
Kendra A.,/user_details?userid=5RU33H3nz9G66rfUdeK4tA,"Brooklyn, NY",6/16/2019,4,It's a pretty decent place. The seating is a bit tight especially if you're a party of two. The crunchy oysters are incredible. A bit pricey on the Wagyu's but seems to be worth the price. Got the 50day aged porterhouse for two and it did the same justice as the oysters. Staff is definitely well-accommodating.

I came here last night for dinner around 8:30 and the tables were taken but the server (a really sweet girl) told us we can sit at the bar until something opens up, we sat ordered our drinks and food and luckily someone left not long after. THE YUZU MOJITO IS BOMB! it was so good i finished it in less than 5 minutes! If you have not tried it yet definitely try it! We ordered the 50 day aged steak and the wagyu... their menu was quite confusing they have the price listed as one price but mentions its (8oz for two people) for the wagyu and min order of two but has the price as $49 next to it...when its suppose to be $98?!?  I don't understand why it wasn't labeled as $98 to begin with if you had to order two minimum but only get one steak?!? Anyways... we had an order of wagyu which was really good, i enjoyed that alot more than they 50 day aged (we ordered medium rare and it came out medium well.) quite dry and a little overcooked .. We got an order of branzino and it was okay but slightly overcooked as well... i think i prefer raw fish more because there's no bones. The wagyu sushi was REALLY GOOD and the Wagyu with uni was really good too those were probably my two favorite dishes the whole night. We also tried the octopus appetizer which was perfectly cooked... I would switch the branzino with hamachi next time. The server was really nice and friendly, water was refilled in a timely manner.   Took off one star for my overcooked 50 day aged steak and one star for the mediocre branzino which was slightly overcooked.. our bill came out to be 400 for three people after tips and tax. I would definitely come back for their cocktails and appetizer.. but probably skip on their steak."

I chose this place because well the food looks delicious but half the things I wanted weren't even on the menu. My poke bowl was $16.00 and though it looked yummy, it was salty. I could hardly finish the rest. I did end up biting a piece of my brothers burger. His burger was pretty tasty I'll give them that. But this place is definitely on the pricey side and the wait for food was a little too long..considering they only had 3 customers on a Sunday afternoon."
Joe M.,/user_details?userid=aWdxFzHQnJROER71h17KGA,"Brooklyn, NY",3/28/2018,5,Great spot for a different kind of Steakhouse. Really enjoyed every aspect of my visit. Started with a grilled octopus appetizer and it waa cooked perfectly along with asian spices and sauces which made it unique. NY Strip for entree couldn't have been more top quality and cooked perfectly. The service was on point and I highly recommend..
Phoebe M.,/user_details?userid=uCfPb6AgoQ8DelQvMRePug,"Davis, CA",3/14/2021,2,"We chose to seat outside because of the safety, but the outside environment is bad. And the attitude of waiter is not friendly maybe because of our nationality. We did not give 18% of tips since the reasons above and they asked us to give more. The reason they provide is that environment is not the reason of bad service. So ridiculous!!!! Honestly, the food is okay but if you want to date with someone important, don't choose this place. Two stars only for food and chef."
Matt B.,/user_details?userid=XCGwWynugirYT8jca3muCA,"Freeport, NY",4/28/2018,5,"We came here for dinner as a couple with no reservations and were seated at the kitchen counter. There is a good drink selection and a limited menu, but all of the food coming out was definitely of high quality. We opted for the dry aged strip steak and a salmon roll. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium and the salmon roll was done beautifully with very fresh ingredients. For desert, we had the mochi waffle ice cream dish. Their black sesame ice cream was very good. I think this restaurant leans more towards the $$$ category, rather than $$. Overall, we would consider returning to try more of their delicious dishes."

Had fried oyster, crab cake and grilled octopus; two sushi rolls; and surf and turf. All really well prepared- but the filet mignon was amazingly tender and the lobster had hollandaise sauce applied already. I'd say the only thing missing was more side options- like their take on creamed spinach or another steakhouse staple. I would go back for sure."

The food was delicious and our waiter was great! I had the black snapper which was one of the fish of the day...and boy oh boy!  I couldn't even finish it and was glad I was able to enjoy it at home lol my siblings had the steak and the lobster, which they enjoyed. I will definitely be visiting again!"
William J.,/user_details?userid=LF27ArszNqBHdnrL44OODg,"New York, NY",6/18/2018,5,"Very pricey but the steak is worth it. Salad is not their forte, go for the meat. If you need a salad, their kale salad is actually better than their seaweed salad, surprisingly for a Japanese steakhouse. Get the wagyu beef appetizer with sea urchin, it's great, and it's one of the most interesting flavor profiles on the menu. The grilled vegetables, particularly the broccoli, are simple and really showcase the charcoal. If you can only get two things, make it the porterhouse steak and the broccoli."

monet m.,/user_details?userid=q2dD9mxuFpMV21uGcXuNRw,"Brooklyn, NY",12/7/2017,5,"OMG !!!! So freaking amazing. From the wait staff to the food to the price this place knocks it out of the park. Went here for a good friends birthday and we had the best experience. Got the steak special and different rolls and the two different tartars. So freakin' good. And any place that has Uni already amazing, you know the fish is fresh if they have that on the menu. Definitely recommend this place for dates, get togethers or just an all around good Japanese meal."

LeAnne B.,/user_details?userid=s6fmAliBn4-pNR7udaTQ7g,"New York, NY",4/15/2018,4,I was surprised to find that this place has a downstairs section at the end of the hall. The spirits selection is vast to say the least so be prepared to sift through the drink menu for a while if you're the indecisive type. I would highly recommend the crab cakes as a starter - delicious! The miso soup is the best I've ever tasted. However the reason this is four stars instead of five though is because the duck was a bit chewy and not as tender as I would have hoped - especially when you have to wait 30 minutes more for ordering it! Bonus points for presentation though and the dipping sauces that come with it. I would like to come back and actually try a steak here as I like the atmosphere and east meets west steakhouse fusion concept. Would be perfect for a nice albeit expensive date!

Andrew B.,/user_details?userid=O_MqoEepzQtO0yUB2Q5XsQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4/22/2018,4,"Came for the filet topped with uni, left loving the cheese fries and uni wagyu hand roll. Sushi surprised to the upside, steak was very good as well, but I prefer traditional steakhouses if you are getting just the New York strip (the uni steak on the other hand is special and worth it)!

Tatiana f.,/user_details?userid=Tbg3nNccw9yOV3_v11zbvA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/22/2019,5,"My friend brought me here to try wagyu for the first time and wow it was an experience like I've never had before. I will caveat that the wagyu steak is very expensive so it might not be in everyone's budget but if you can afford it then it's worth trying at least once. We got the portion for 2 ($150) which comes with 6 3-inch slices of meat (about 2-3 bites per slice) so it's small but it is so packed with flavor, so rich and buttery, that if you get some sides or appetizers you should be satisfied. Wagyu comes from cows bred in japan that are fed a special diet and raised so that they have a high fat content that is intermuscular/marbled within the muscle which creates a texture and taste unlike any other steak. Every bite of meat is like butter with a seared crisp on the outside. I don't know how else to describe it. We also got the wagyu sushi which was my favorite. The matcha cake was good too. The shishito and eggplant starter was delicious. The service was excellent. We sat downstairs which was really intimate, quiet, and cozy. This meal was one of the unforgettable ones."

I ve ordered the uni steak, uni wagyu beef roll , French fries and two sushi rolls which I m impressed (salmon and yellow tail roll). I wouldn't go for the steak and beef roll cos not special at all jus the uni on the top and it wasn't super fresh lol  well but I would definitely go back for the sushi rolls cos the rolls mixed with the veg/basil tgt are surprisingly match 'fresh' ,not jus adding taste by putting those creamy sauce with spicy mayo"

Hershel P.,/user_details?userid=8y3-L1LHKIUyekhMrbhawQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",12/1/2020,5,"One the best steak experiences in NYC. In the handful of visits I have had, I was not let down. The service is always great. Very well educated staff. The Wagyu is a must try, as there is no steak that comes close to matching the flavor. I was even able to have a conversation with our waiter to find out he is a native of Miyazaki. Not only is the wagyu to die for, but the dry aged porterhouse will have you drooling as soon as you walk up to be seated. The drooling continues until you see it come to your table with the delicious discs of butter. Cooked perfectly to the requested medium rare, every piece from top to bottom was full of flavor and just melted away. For dessert, the matcha cake is a great fluffy realization that there is room left in your belly. On top of the great food, I've never been let down by any of the cabs or sake I've enjoyed. The restaurant seems to be taking the right precautions to run through COVID and I didn't experience any compromise on the quality of food before or after the pandemic."

When we sat they not only let us feel welcomed , but our dog as well. The waiter,Adrian's , recommendation of porterhouse and the eel roll. That was by far the best roll I've had in a long time. The steak, all the sauces , and the sides to die for. I Plan to come back soon"
Dmitri I.,/user_details?userid=CCi_Q68_TGHuZM1ppgN2Zg,"Brooklyn, NY",1/9/2018,5,If you are looking for fancy modern design this is not for you. This place is all about food. It is very cozy though. I give it 5 stars because food was the best in compare to other japanese restaurants I visited. The first time I tried Wagyu Sashimi and I must say it's my fav appetizer now. We also had special - wagyu beef and foie gras cake and steak for two. Dishes were descent sizes and absolutely amazing plus served in unique way. It also looked pretty busy and that must say about popularity of the place. I'd recommend it.

We went in the summer and they had the windows open which was very pleasant. We sat at the bar and had an awesome view  of the love graffiti wall across. Armando the bartender was super and made me a Mai-hito  ( his impromptu  Mai style mohjito infused with Prosecco/ something that seems to be making its way soon to the menu ) ..what a creative mixologist. The shrimp tempura roll was to-die-for and so was the kale  salad that had pickled lotus roots!!!!.. divine! We shared a grilled branzino fish of of the day ..cooked to perfection! What a great find and we are definitely making this out Williamsburg must stop.

On the contrary the open kitchen design is cool but the cooks back there were staring at us and talking to each other and constantly looking back and just being weirdos, also I watched multiple cooks shake hands with people outside of the kitchen and resume cooking without washing hands or putting on gloves due to those two last things I saw in the kitchen I'd give this place 1 star but the service was really good so I'll be nice."

So we got young  cheddar cheese tempura and Hurami beef also black cod saikyo miso yaki.

Jean H.,/user_details?userid=65uanCxCQIkiw76wbVWtHw,"Manhattan, NY",6/17/2018,1,"Do not come here. Here's the thing, the food was somewhat delish but no where close to what you have to compromise for in terms of service and wait time. Management needs to step their game up. Appetizers and entrees came out sporadically. One of our friends had finished his entire meal while we watched for 70 minutes till other RAW appetizers  were presented. And then after that mediocre tease, was another 30 minutes of waiting till other entrees rolled our. The wait staff could give two shits about this disorderly service unfolding9. Way overly priced in terms of portion. And again, the abysmal service took away from everything. And again, do not come here. I won't again."

The chef is a humble rockstar. We were here for our 21st wedding anniversary and the chef got wind of that and came out and took a selfie with us. He also blessed us with the most delicious desert a chocolate cake but obviously not your average chocolate cake. It was let's just say next level on steroids. We had the porterhouse steak for 3 and I'll say it...welcome to flavor town baby. It was dare I say it...the best steak I've ever had in my life, yeah I said it with Peter Lugers down the street. I'm a self proclaimed ""foodie"" so I know what I'm talking about lol. We also had the Branzino which was de-boned in front of us also amazing. The crab cake and sushi were out of this world. The chef also in our celebration blessed us with some yuzu sake. Astounding!  Bottom line is that this is a hidden gem. Can't wait to return. Shout out and massive respect to chef Taadaki Shizaki..you are the man!"
Andrew H.,/user_details?userid=oTLNkehkzxkh6sfZo7HKPA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/13/2018,1,VERY OVER PRICED!!!!  To the point of being a total scam.  $160 for a surf and turf.  They list it as Market priced.  Food was decent but not worth it. Will never go back again.

The appetizers tuna tartare and the shisito peppers were good. The steak was cooked well. It was my birthday dinner. My only complaint was that they could not accommodate one more person, and stressed that when reservations are changed, we would have to be seated at 8, two hours later, they offered us seats next to one another at the bar. While I was waiting, there were a group of 3 who walked in, they didn't have reservations, and she told them she doesn't have a seat for them until later, and then they were seated them immediately. Unfortunately, my friend left and we had no choice but to keep the reservation for 2. I was looking forward to dinner but, I ended up not feeling the best."

My dear boss treated me and a bunch of coworkers here. She's been raving about their uni and filet mignon for the longest time! We had 5:30 reservations and came on time. We were seated and right away we ordered four at $125 a pop. The server looked at us and said, ""it's $125 an order, you sure you want four? WITHOUT flinching, my boss said, we know!"" I thought that was extremely RUDE of him! Other than that, the meal came out perfect and to everyone's satisfaction. The steak, on point! The uni, generous amount (see photos), the chef, knows what he's doing! Would recommend for the food if you're willing to overlook the rude customer service.

We shared the charcoal grilled edamame, their special, which consisted of a quail egg topped with truffle oil + mushroom shavings, salmon roe, and sea urchin, the crunchy oyster, and fries. I also had the tuna avocado roll and the passion fizz to drink. Everything was so incredibly delicious with amazing flavors and great mixture of textures.  The service was also impeccable. I can't wait to come back here"

The sushi was great - salmon three ways was a great sampler style. The grilled chicken thigh with scallion was perfectly cooked. Loved the wagyu rice. Looking forward to going back and trying more items on the menu.

Nothing was overpowering."
Sau Soke J.,/user_details?userid=x7VhG5H2v0bA9QNmn7VQfg,"GARDEN CITY P, NY",6/29/2019,1,"Called on Wednesday to make a Saturday reservation. The manager tells me that the indoor seatings are all booked but I can try calling the day of to make reservation for the outdoor seatings. Reason the reservation for outdoor must be made on the day of is because it must be weather permitted. The manager even went ahead to assure he is the manager and that it will be noted that I called ahead of time. Saturday comes around, I call at 12pm, was told that the reservation can only be made by the manager, but the manager won't be in until 2-3pm. Tried calling in again around 2pm, manager still isn't in. Finally by 3pm a manager calls me back. But a different manager this time. She tells me that the outdoor seating is fully booked by ppl who called ahead of time. She even tried to claim that the other manager meant to say, it was their intention to say I'm on the waiting list Incase someone cancels. I'm sure I know the difference between cancellation and weather permitting. There are only 2 managers total in the restaurant. How unprofessional that you cannot align on situations like this and provide basic details about the regulation. Thanks for wasting my time."
Shay S.,/user_details?userid=WBz8gHfNBYckLxnY7poh5A,"Orlando, FL",8/23/2019,1,"I was venturing around for places to eat with my girlfriend and we stumbled across this place, looked pretty good. Now let me just say I'm 2019 not everything has to be some sort of fusion cuisine, we don't need to constantly try to reinvent things because it kinda just isn't good, stick with whatcha know. We arrive and are seated immediately, however our server walked by us a bunch of times (the place is small) and kinda didn't acknowledge us much. We had questions and it was getting pretty late, we were told the kitchen would be closing so there was a sense of urgency. The menu prices were extremely high for what it was. I'm all for paying extra for good cuisine but to find out a basic tuna avocado roll was over $20 was kind of ridiculous. They had steaks and wagyu items that were about $48-52 each, however for that price there was no sides given. So it was just very expensive for the sake of saying they are a fusion restaurant. We got up and left kinda immediately and ended up eating pizza at Joe's Pizza, all in all I can say the pizza was delicious and a much better experience than what we would have had at Salt + Charcoal."

Jewely W.,/user_details?userid=mJcR0vcXgcwbuuc_NR669A,"Quincy, MA",2/12/2019,5,"5 Star Service & Food - My boyfriend and I were in the area looking for somewhere to eat for dinner. I was looking up places on Yelp and saw that this establishment was number one on the list of restaurants. We decided to go here and we were not disappointed. We arrived around 6:15pm - 6:30pm and were seated immediately. We ordered the 50 day Porterhouse Steak for two with one of the Specials of the day that contained salmon roe, truffle oil, shredded truffle and other fresh ingredients. For drinks, I had the Passion Fizz and the boyfriend got the Yuzu Mule. The drinks were well made and had the perfect balance of alcohol and flavor. Our lovely waitress said that it would take about 45 mins for our rare Porterhouse Steak to be cooked and suggested that we order an appetizer/side while we waited. (That's when we opted for the Special, which was delicious) While we were waiting, our waitress gave us some sort of Veggie Chips, free of charge! All the servers were very attentive and cute! Our waters would always be refilled before hitting the half way point. The Porterhouse steak was beautifully presented and the sauces that went with it, complimented the meat well. My boyfriend and I devoured everything. For dessert, we ordered the salted banana caramel monaka. The presentation was adorable and tasted delightful. We left happy and completely satisfied! Would 110% come again."
May L.,/user_details?userid=0BPLLsVUuOAEFHBctC0Zcg,"New York, NY",12/15/2018,5,"Had to try their uni filet mignon and it did not disappoint. It was uni with salmon roe on top of the filet mignon which sat on a bed of greens. There were crushed sesame on the side and their house sauce. As I sliced the piece of filet mignon, the uni oozed off the meat onto the platter. It was a sight to behold. The duck was just as impressive! Two slices of perfectly cook duck delivered in a smoke filled glass dome. We also had the crispy oyster, crab cake and fries. Service was excellent."

It was cool to watch the flames from the charcoal grill. The shishito peppers were great, lovely flavor with great broth. The steak itself was a bit disappointing. At about $100 for two people, it was served slightly more done than I would have liked (asked for medium rare but it was more medium well done) and the sauces they provide, while interesting, didn't serve the meat as well.  I think it overall was more expensive than it should have been given the lower quality."

This place came highly recommend we had the dry aged 50 day strip steak for $47.and we were sitting across from the open kitchen and the chef just puts them in the oven. The meat tastes good and cooked to proper temp but oven not hot  enough to get maillard  reaction. They would be better off just searing it in s pan. Then I see them open a bag of frozen fries from Sysco. It's really not difficult to cut potatoes And their ketchup tastes like red gold. Place looks cool but NY is Heinz country. Sorry for the harsh review guys but maybe it will make you be more on your game. Oh had an excellent bottle of  Pomerol priced right at $68.

Started with crab cakes which had so much crab and almost no filling with great sauces which I can't specifically place what was in them. I had the salmon with potatoes and asparagus on the side all cooked perfect with just the right amount of seasoning. The duck was a close runner up and looked amazing, looking like it was cooked perfect when it was sitting in front of someone next to me. The service was good and staff was friendly.

The Kushiyuki was so tasty, the Wagyu Carpaccio melted into my mouth, the lamp chop was so tender, steam clam can't be more tasty, can't get any where provided fresher Sashmi. Oh.... Have to mention that, I am not a sweet person- not crazy about dessert, but their Balack Seasame Pudding got me in, almost forgot about the Bafun- the uni shooter, that was the best I ever have so far. Also, the service there was very nice too, make you feel warm as home. Me and my friends all said we have to go back ther to try other dishes ."

The food was really good, although the wagyu was a bit cold to my liking but none the less was still really delicious as well as the uni. The caviar was a bit too salty but paired well with the uni. The truffle oil was a must and was delicious with the wagyu. It was pretty expense but what do you expect when ordering wagyu and uni."

Other people had the same idea to let someone else cook up a great meal and be served at the same time. Started with the Japanese Wagyu and uni shooters. Two small servings but so fresh and a perfect pairing. Moved on to grilled edemamme and it had a nice deep flavor so different from your everyday legumes. The main dish was the skirt steak with grilled broccoli. Enough for two people and the dry aging was spot on. so succulent and juicy. That grill makes all the difference. Can't wait to be back.

I had waited in heavy anticipation for the one person I knew would agree to go to get into town ( a lot of my friends are vegan/ would rather not drop money on dinner). We go, we order, anticipation builds, and the most mediocre steak I have ordered in the past 3 years was set down before me. The meat was tough and greasy ( to be clear it was not marbled and fatty and this maybe coming off as greasy it was just greasy). It was also very over cooked. My waiter honestly didn't really pay attention to us at all he looked at two early twenties girls and probably assumed what a lot of people do, that we wouldn't be spending enough for him to care, which really wasn't true we both were prepared to spend around $150 for each of us. I mentioned my steak was overdone and he didn't do a thing, didn't offer to send it back. So I was over it. Moral of the story: go spend $100 on a steak somewhere else :)"

Janet L.,/user_details?userid=YKVEsaXnAkqKWuYJteQBqg,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2/15/2020,3,"Came here for Valentine's Day since a friend suggested we come here to try the wagyu. We had the Valentine's Day menu ($100 per person) and everything was pretty good except a few things. The crab cake we tried was a little dry but the sushi, sashimi and soup were good. But the most important part, the wagyu ($24 additional), was disappointing. I had already tried wagyu in Japan so my standards were pretty high. It was way too fat and had too much charred/Smokey flavor. This is coming from someone who loves fatty/intensive flavored steak. It honestly felt like I was just eating really fat bbq meat and I could barely finish it because it ruined my appetite. My boyfriend, his friend and his girlfriend all agreed that it could been better. However, we also all agreed that the matcha chocolate cake topped with ice cream, strawberries, and blackberries was really good. Overall still a good experience, but if you're coming here to try the wagyu, you should probably go someplace else."

Alex S.,/user_details?userid=Ei5Wf26JGiSWKzyRPEyf_Q,"Queens, Queens, NY",2/13/2020,5,This spot was really good definitely coming back I had the porterhouse for 2 which was delicious with a side of cheese fries and broccoli that was just as good. Came here with a date that's never had a porterhouse and they didn't let use down! Btw the Pineapple Express was the only drink we had but we didn't need any other it's def a creeper!  Good spot chill vibe with great food.
Johnny C.,/user_details?userid=oFHO_7emaNdQ-uYKtLEncg,"Brooklyn, NY",2/11/2020,1,$270 for market price truffle Wagyu steak. Presentation looked like someone puked on your steak.  The wait was long and the steak was already  cold when it arrived.   Not a 2$ restaurant and the food was not good at all.

We have had it 3 times now. The other dishes are good but here it's all about perfect wood grilled beef and they nail it. Get a seat at the ""sushi"" bar style bench in from of the grill and salivate."
Christine L.,/user_details?userid=CrW0J-PsTYrtSzPzrH5IYg,"New York, NY",8/29/2018,5,Spectacular sea urchin steak that only found at Salt+Charcoal but no where else  it's a very good pace to consider have a table for four bc you can order more different things to share.
Carlos M.,/user_details?userid=M3_VovePPBUjG39cat1Aiw,"OZONE PARK, NY",4/25/2017,4,"I was looking to have some steak in Williamsburg with the family, nothing crazy expensive then this restaurant came up for a moderate price. I made a quick reservation, we sat but then The prices were not accurate at all, the prices in menu are way higher..is definitely a $$$ instead of $$. Besides that, the food was delicious, we had the porterhouse steak, grilled octopus, fried oysters and fried broccoli. I'm not cheap when it comes to restaurants but this time I wasn't planning on spending so much, I felt a little fooled by yelp. The service was great and very nice environment."

Sharon K.,/user_details?userid=n60yD0hmQOueJ9WHVYTOiw,"RIDGEWOOD, NY",8/25/2017,1,"The Uni-Wagyu beef starter was quite blend - the Wagyu beef was completely lost, maybe the beefy umami flavor would have been enhanced if the beef were lightly torched/seared instead of served raw.  The housemade tofu dish was frankly not as delicate as that you find in chinatown (for less $) or even Biang (Chinese place in the East Village).  The sesame risotto served with the duck dish was weird - imagine adding peanut butter to risotto  ... it has that dry mouth feel instead of creaminess one would expect from risotto.  Not a repeat."
Jennifer E.,/user_details?userid=sJQeW49HekMPbfLT84tMaQ,"Long Island City, NY",8/15/2017,4,I visited S+C to celebrate my new move to Williamsburg having read nothing about it online (review-wise which is surprising for me).  I really enjoyed the food and the wine.  I thought the menu was unique... very intriguing (who makes cheese fries with swiss cheese? OMG you must try these)... varied options including divine sushi rolls.  Yes it takes 30 minutes for the grilled meats but once you watch the methods used over the open grill you'll understand why.  Service was fine for me - I've now been here 3x.  The portions are bigger than I thought so just order one sushi roll vs. many and the sides were also ample (asparagus and broccoli were delicious!).  I will be back a 4th time.  Well Done S+C.

They adopted a more traditional steakhouse concept. But the most memorable and delicious dish was the wagyu sushi. This won me over. Even if everything else failed, this more than made up for it."
Ani Y.,/user_details?userid=KShgxCgCyVlD6dEfro1T7g,"Manhattan, NY",1/13/2018,4,"3.5 stars. Cozy steakhouse for a date night. I love the smell and feel of an open fire cooking away. They offer a little small fried lotus root chips to snack on while waiting for food. The service is prompt and friendly and gave plenty of suggestions. We ordered the porterhouse, potatoes, and the grilled octopus. The octopus was tender and not chewy. It was well flavored and perfectly cooked. The taters were OK, nothing too special flavor wise but cooked perfectly. The porterhouse was a bit underwhelming though. It definitely needed the addition of salt and that herb butter. It has a lovely texture and grill marks but flavor wise it didn't scream steak. Most steaks I have are usually eaten without sauces but I felt like the sauces definitely needed to be used."

Cheese fries were covered in powdery cheese and cold.  Regular fries were also cold when served.  Charred broccoli sides were mushy as-- tasted like frozen thawed broccoli.   Wagyu steak was good but they have this obsession with sauces that really are not necessary if your steak is good quality.  Uni steak was a waste of money.   Customer service was good at table.  Hostess was not nice-- walked into the empty restaurant (we had reservation for 5:30 when they open) holding 2 toddlers and the hostess insisted we stand and wait because we had to have a full party before allowing us to settle with the kids at our table in the basement even though we explained the other 2 were just finishing parking the car 1 block away.   It's just not empathic, esp in a 100%empty restaurant and the fact that we confirmed our reservation 3 times!"

JoJo G.,/user_details?userid=lvui4kiS5rzKGCJs-uELKQ,"New York, NY",10/19/2018,1,"What started as a fun friends reunion in NY turned into a very unfortunate event none of us will ever forget or expect for it to happen to anyone in NY. We made a reservation for 6:00 pm for 5 (all women) and were there on time. Our servers were great. Unfortunately around 7:30 pm as we had just ordered our last round of drinks, a man approached our table with check in hand and told us we had exceeded the 2 hour limit they have on tables. We informed him it had not been 2 hrs yet, which was backed up by the hostess. We told him we were waiting for desert, which arrived as we were saying that to him, and that we were waiting on the last round of drinks. We told him that the check needed to be updated to include those items. As rude as his approach had been we were fine with getting the updated check as we were planning to leave by 8 pm anyway.  He came back with an updated check and we asked for the bill to be split evenly into 4(normal in most places) his response was ""I don't know where you are from, but here in America we don't do this"" and was arguing we didn't understand how things work here. To his surprise although upset we all kept our composure and reminded him that this nation is one of immigrants and that as it happens we are all naturalized citizens that arise from different Latin American countries, with the exception of one whose ancestors have been here for hundreds of years. We paid our $600 bill and made sure to leave a 20% tip to our servers because they honestly did not have not have anything to do with their manager's opinions and looked quite embarrassed to be honest. The restaurant had a  group (5) coming in but there were many booths and other tables that had been there longer than us and were no longer consuming anything. The difference is they were all males and not Latinos as he assumed we all were. We left and our driver as scheduled showed up at 7:50 pm we explained what had happened and that we forgot an umbrella and did not feel comfortable going back in by ourselves.  He accompanied me and that same manager approached me with the umbrella in hand. I asked him why he said what he said in a calm tone, I don't believe in shouting to get a point across but rather in showing that educated people can get a point across through conversations. He acknowledge he is an immigrant himself, and said he didn't think it was offensive at first to which our driver responded it was highly inappropriate to say that to any patrons especially to a group of ladies. He asked if the new guests at the table were aware there was a 2 hr maximum and a maximum of cards one can use to which he replied ""no"".  I reminded him that the website nor the hostess made any mention of such rules when we first made the reservation or when we arrived to the restaurant. We reminded him to treat others with respect. It finally felt like he understood what he had said and how he made us feel, he offered his card and a round of drinks to which replied no thanks. I advised him to go through unconscious bias training and to update his website so no one ever would go through what we did. It was embarrassing and quite honestly hurtful. He had a group of professional women as clients, some are also military wives and for us to be judged solely on our ""looks""  even while dressed professionally was quite upsetting. Oh and he was surprised we were fluent in English too. Training is required***"

I got the salmon and the presentation was great. Most items are served on a slate slab. Really nice selection of steak and wagyu beef. The owner came by and checked in a few times and gave us some history of the rest and also where her purveyors are located which was interesting. Extensive wine list and good Japanese beers on the menu. Would def go back to try the sushi as it came highly recommend.

Jillian L.,/user_details?userid=FpVdxw0Uv0-VIx1nQaK4Cg,"Hicksville, NY",1/28/2017,1,"Have ordered take out and the food was great. Sadly I decided to go there for my brother in laws birthday ( a party of 9). We ordered 2 appetizers and individual entrees. We patiently waited but over an hour had gone by and not even the appetizers. My sister goes to what we thought was the manager but turned out to be the owner. With a big smile and nicely asks for an ETA on the food bc we have reservations after for drinks. He proceeds to tell her that "" This isn't mcdonalds."" My sister keeps her cool ( I wouldn't have, to be honest) and replies with "" I'm not trying to give you a hard time. I just have reservations that I don't want to miss"". His wiseass remark was "" oh I won't remeber you tomorrow"" . Naturally my sister retorts back with "" And I won't remeber you"" and calmly comes back to the table. So we almost have our food. They brought the appetizers along with the entrees. Now I must give credit to the servers bc they were apologetic unlike the owner. So now finally the last entree. We get about 2 bites in and the owner brings us the bill. So I commented right to him "" oh we wait and wait but the bill comes really fast. Nice asshole"" I admit I was offended by his awful attitude and customer service. No one was rude or complained until I spoke up. He then kneels down and asks how does it take us to cook chicken at home. Talk about some nerve. The portions were tiny. Appetizers come before the meal buddy. So all and all food yummy, owner awful and rude."

I have been sooooo fortunate using yelp that I feel doubly upset that my gastronomic luck has finally run out. I use the monocle feature whenever I'm in an unfamiliar part of the city, and this time it led me to S&C. The staff was pleasant and moderately helpful, but the portion to price ratio is ridiculous. I've lived here since 2007, so I'm not new to the cost reality of NYC dining, but both the highlight AND the low point of this meal was the tempura cheddar ""dinner"" app. It was as delicious as it was sparsely allocated. 10 bucks for two and a half bites and some fries, especially when it tasted so good, was like sitting in a Tesla with no tires. My husband's tuna tar tar was also good, but hardly a $20 portion. Seriously, with all the great food around, it's not enough to just match the prices. You have to factor in the inherent value. Sadly, S&C, for us, fell short."

The service of SALT + Charcoal is terrible, Sunday night, we went to there and the welcome waiter let us sit at the bar table since there is no available regular table. We had been sitting in the bar table for 30 minutes and the waiter behind the bar didn't serve us and give us any menu to order food.

The manager Miranda was extremely rude.  As soon as we came in for our reservation for 6 ppl at 6pm on a Friday, she told us that we have a 2 hour limit.  She said it's a ""common practice"" in New York.  Well why didn't you say so when we made the reservation??  Ok it's fine,  we figure we'll have drinks and dessert someplace else afterwards.  She kept coming downstairs during those 2 hours glaring at our table.  First it took 20 min to get our drinks, then after we order, we were told almost everything was ""sold out"", which is ridiculous at 6pm on a Friday when the place was only half full.  Conveniently hmmm everything that was marked ""M.P."" was available though.  We came to have wagu beef and uni, but all we had were basic rolls, the apps that were available.  We ordered the ""M.P."" dishes which was a lobster and a filet Mignon which we noticed after slicing it that it was very undercooked.  Miranda comes down of course again staring at our table which prompted my friend to whisper uh oh she's back and staring again.  Miranda walks over to our table and tells my friend ""just to let you know I wasn't look at you guys if that's what you thought"". What?! What manager does that?!  No ""hi how's everything ladies?"", nothing!  I can't believe it.  We told her the steak was undercook and she said well you already ate it!  What?!!  Hello we sliced it, yes, but we did NOT eat it.  I can't believe she didn't offer to take it back to the kitchen to cook it more.  This woman was damn serious about getting us out within 2 hours.  I'm never dining here again.  The table next to us even said what's wrong with her?  I just can't believe she's a manager.  We did continue our night at Bozu which was awesome!

I had tuna tartar, charcoal grilled edamame, and miso soup (again) for dinner. The miso soup remained awesome. The edamame was nicely salted, which worked well with the grilled taste. The tuna tartar was served in a hollow bamboo tube and then mixed with other ingredients by the waiter before I took over rolling the mix into small dried nori sheets. While slightly gimmicky, the result was delicious. Highly recommended."

Also had shrimp tempura and was mushy and soggy.  Sake was the only thing I enjoyed but that is in a bottle that they had nothing to do with. Where is the best japanese place ? Still searching
Amin S.,/user_details?userid=S7824EZT7pldcOr1goOSBQ,"Savannah, GA",5/19/2017,5,"Needless to say how good the steak is, but also sushi and other appetizers will be a great addition to your dining experience!"
Cynthia P.,/user_details?userid=lsYVz8nRbn3XRTohsfmUsA,"Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY",11/28/2015,5,"Just had a lovely birthday dinner here with a group of close friends in their quiet basement dining room. Great ambiance and amazing food with beautiful presentation and gracious service. We tried a little of everything, but I loved the miso cod, chicken meatballs, seaweed salad, cold homemade tofu with 3 salts, and the outstanding pork belly with mashed potatoes... Our waiter brought out an epic desert platter at the end which made the night even memorable.  If you're looking for fast service with cheap and giant portions, go elsewhere. This was an altogether well-paced and delicious meal without any rush. Highly recommended."
Bella D.,/user_details?userid=ht8nYD1W7BJ3_aU3kX15Iw,"Flushing, NY",1/15/2017,2,"This turns out to be a big disappointment. While the environment and service are really nice, I am not a fan of the food there. The cheese tempera isn't exactly what I pictured in mind. We did not finish half of it cause it kinda tastes funny. The wagyu rib eye roll has tender beef with some strange looking and tasting rice. Sushi rolls has a lot more rice than other places and they weren't packed tightly. They all start falling apart the sec I pick them up."
Zohaib H.,/user_details?userid=ybYwTO-rSe6KDMW653z_1g,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",8/14/2015,4,Had the set lunch menu and the food was very tasty and they use very good quality ingredients

Yihao O.,/user_details?userid=xt9H5e7_Re-QPW-N_ED7kQ,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",3/4/2018,2,"I have to say we were quite disappointed. From the ambience to the menu to the service staff everything looked good in this place. The description of food on the menu were filled with interesting ingredients like wagyu beef, uni, octopus.  However the chef failed all these ingredients. Wagyu beef tartar with uni was flat in taste and flavor. Porterhouse steak was dry. I felt like my homemade steak is better that that.  Even cheese French fries was done wrong. The cheese became hard shortly after served and did not make it easy to dip. They even screwed up the yellow tail neck which is a common dish in small neighborhood Japanese restaurants. Not going back."
Tabatha T.,/user_details?userid=MRRyhOqxbcLbwQPLA35qJw,"Brooklyn, NY",12/6/2018,5,"Outstanding Food!  Everything my husband and I ate was superb. We wanted to go back the very next day.

Sarah J.,/user_details?userid=Uoz4N3fKTDqJlfmgUcv4oA,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",4/25/2019,5,"I am blown away by how phenomenal the food is here. The quality of the ingredients, the depth of flavor, and the simplicity of the dishes make for the most unbelievable meal. The broccoli, steak salad, salmon are perfection."
Vina P.,/user_details?userid=Vfq9K3BnPhVB3G_ZysFw8w,"Brooklyn, NY",4/23/2016,5,Really solid place. Delicious food and great service. A little expensive so I tend to go for their lunch specials instead. Their mackerel is excellent.
Nicolle F.,/user_details?userid=tqVczZOu04nzeJNwz9ykKg,"Brooklyn, NY",4/21/2016,5,"Love Salt + Charcoal! Everything I've tried there is very good, the duck and mushroom salad is a great salad. Really enjoyed the waygu carpaccio as well. We usually share some of the skewers, have yet to try one there that I do not like. The chicken wings are also delicious. Service is relaxed but prompt. I especially love their Monday music series. Perfect way to start the week, good music and good eats."
Mikaela C.,/user_details?userid=LukIAn-LD2QwEcke5emJeA,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/13/2017,5,"This place is AMAZING. The food is great (and cool), the sushi is probably the best sushi ever. But the service.. oh my god the service. Jonathan gave us the best service possible all evening and that totally made our whole stay in New York. Thanks you for the best dining experience!"
Emma T.,/user_details?userid=um04RNM87jNsttsRYus1KQ,"New York, NY",11/4/2017,5,"without a doubt, this is my new favorite spot. my friend took me here for my birthday a couple weeks ago, and we had the most divine food - uni shooters, salmon roll, strip steak, lobster. everything was AMAZING, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. the ambiance and service were A+ too. can't wait for my next visit here!"
X X.,/user_details?userid=_Y3cltUXT9TmHP5RmDfjJA,"Miami, FL",3/27/2019,5,"I found this place by accident, just walked in. I criticize  everything, everywhere, it's hard to impress me. This place is best in the neighborhood. Service and food beyond expectations. Large portions. Sushi comes in non traditional flavors. Service is very prompt and not annoying. The crowd that dines there is also sophisticated.  Draw back is the limited space."
Julie H.,/user_details?userid=eQI_gsNnQljsJNT9pLx85g,"Florence, OR",8/27/2016,5,Can't complain everything here always taste amazing! But don't you guys dare take off the Uni shot because that would be a deal breaker and you'll never see me again!!  good times and good food always!
Niki S.,/user_details?userid=9FRI4tAomhFUmubg-fo1Tw,"Sunnyside, NY",3/16/2019,2,"I have to say, this review is only because of the uni steak they advertise everywhere. The uni truffle special? DIVINE. The uni steak? Ordered it medium. It was rare. Filet mignon is supposed to be soft and tender, it was chewy and flavorless. Not to mention cold. I can't believe I spent $130 on that steak. It's truly disappointing that they advertise and hype something up so much to then have it be so lackluster. Long story short, go for a drink with an app, skip the steaks."
Trenee C.,/user_details?userid=JDBYpkXGeyAIqdMuBGlJ4w,"Brooklyn, NY",4/22/2016,5,I can eat here everyday. So many choices for one person or a group with so many different food lifestyles. The staff is friendly and down to earth. And the smiles from behind the glass of the open kitchen are so refreshing. But not as refreshing as the OOLONG-HI. GET INVOLVED
Cay S.,/user_details?userid=NnCw3NYkPqxAQv4hFycBTQ,"New York, NY",7/31/2016,5,I've eaten here about 5 times already and each time the food is more amazing. The mixed drinks are delicious. I've tried so many things on the menu and I haven't found a single item I didn't like. It's a super cute place on a cool summer night when all of the doors are open. I've come here with friends and with my family and every person I brought here absolutely loved the food. The deserts are all amazing and really hit the spot after a yummy meal. I always leave there super happy. The waiters are super attentive and polite. Love this place!
Alicia V.,/user_details?userid=9xp_BzNp9AIJftWyrhwJww,"Swedesboro, NJ",12/20/2016,4,"This was a fun place but very small.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed some warm sake and I had mulled sangria. We also ordered a flight of sake and tried coffee, charcoal, and rosemary.  They were interesting. We did not order food but the options looked delicious.  I loved that there were pictures of the different dishes."
Emma N.,/user_details?userid=Qu9uuQgMas5dDKuWl6DgtQ,"New York, NY",12/5/2016,4,Delicious. Although how I managed to spend $300 on 2 people for dinner was a bit of a shock!
mazi r.,/user_details?userid=cXPcIal4BXPFeGEHdBmY_Q,"Elmhurst, NY",7/7/2018,2,Mediocore at best. Uni are fresh but the steak were not good. The atmosphere were nice and relax. Service was good. Too pricy for what it is.

The ambiance of Salt+ Charcoal is pretty nice. I really admired how attentive and nice the servers were. The creamy shrimp croquette was my favorite, we also ordered shrimp tempura and the baby back ribs which were delicious. I definitely want to come back here for brunch one day and try those menu items!"
J. Karim A.,/user_details?userid=2eN4NRcL3b3mTqGktCpysg,"New York, NY",6/11/2016,3,"I love Japanese food and I came for a dinner date. Easy to make a reservation but ended up sitting at the bar instead. It was happy hour. $3 sake and $5 sake cocktail. The sake was what you expect for $3. The cocktail was like sweet lemonade. I ordered a carafe of sake that was better. The food was fine. Nothing special. Had grilled vegetables. The chicken skewers were ok, I liked the thigh one. The wagging marinated in ponzu was pretty good. I probably wouldn't visit again as I wasn't wowed. Service was good and the place is nice. You can see them cooking if you sit in the back half of the restaurant."
Lisa R.,/user_details?userid=nFURV-iqwdm7zfP5j6YIgw,"Franklin Square, NY",7/13/2018,5,So we originally went somewhere else that was really rude but got a great recommendation for Salt + Charcoal so we took a walk over! The atmosphere was great and relaxing! We wished we would have sat closer to the kitchen to watch how they worked! The food was delicious! Pricey but absolutely worth it!
Ben A.,/user_details?userid=Pdf_czaLTvaidfyKkJcJPA,"Brooklyn, NY",5/18/2015,5,"I've never eaten at Salt & Charcoal, so my review is only of the service. This evening I saw a server and management deal with an unruly customer in a way that deserves praise. In fact, the customer isn't always right-- sometimes they are entitled jerks and their return patronage is not worth the headaches it brings. To the manager on duty, please continue to stand behind your employee."
Brilliantine E.,/user_details?userid=c5QoHI6ZuHpsNKQOFf3slw,"New York, NY",7/24/2015,5,"I rarely have food porn moments because jeez I mean come on people. But I tell you what, their homemade tofu was an orgy in my mouth."

Lauren P.,/user_details?userid=nfEuSi5SmJ-kHJMrtzjJDw,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",11/16/2018,5,"This place is so good. I came in with my boyfriend a couple weeks ago, and despite it being busy we were seated right away. The service was good, and the food was fantastic. The kitchen is in the glass room that sits in the center of the restaurant, and we sat right by it and watched them cook everything. We started with Wagyu Sushi, which was so flavorful that it just melted in your mouth. Then, we got steak for two with broccoli. Everything was cooked perfectly and was matched with sauces that complemented our meal flawlessly. We got Mochi for dessert, which was the perfect finish to a great meal. I look forward to bringing friends in next time."
Josh H.,/user_details?userid=xwJt9uUNgSQqpTx1gBeAGA,"New York, NY",7/20/2015,5,"Amazing Japanese food, great, friendly staff. I'll definitely be back. Give this place a visit if you're in the area, you won't be disappointed."

The host working was impossibly happy and super pleasant. The sushi was really interesting. Rather than rolled up, it was flat and rectangular. The portions were huge. The kale salad was really cool, too. It came with three different salts to flavor the white creamy dressing (?). I will be back for both!"

Doug S.,/user_details?userid=S-rtIizrPpzXBYq11wVKag,"Brooklyn, NY",8/10/2015,1,"Honestly, you can rave all you want about the food but waiting 45 minutes for RAW beef is just entirely unacceptable.  Painful dining experience.  The 2 of us got served a full 30 minutes before the RAW beef plate showed up for the 3rd person.  We complained and was told the beef was defrosting.  Huh? Worst of all, manager threw the waitress under the bus saying she was new...when in reality the kitchen is visible to diners and we could see that there is absolutely no urgency to getting food prepared.  A lot of effort though stoking those charcoal embers!   Place was mobbed when it first opened, and not surprised it was so empty last night considering the way they do business.  I guess the word is out that if you have 3 hours to kill this is the place to go."
Saba B.,/user_details?userid=Xn2LW772S7zUx-_zbf_3_A,"Northbrook, IL",7/14/2019,1,"I would say avoid this place for lunch, at all costs. We ordered a steak salad and a wagyu burger (med-rare). The food took an hour to come out, and the explanation was that the patty takes a while (really?? Medium-Rare?) The fries were clearly refried and held a ton of oil with that shininess that tells you they've been fried once too often. The steak in my wife's salad looked boiled, which is just a travesty for place that specializes in steak. Meanwhile, the person next to us got the steak salad as well. Got unappetizing boiled chunks for meat. Brought it up to the service staff, and simply got a ""sorry, it shouldn't be like that"". She did get her whole bill at the end. We offered her fries, but I think she was just done! I'm not sure if there was a drastic change in kitchen staff between the last review that sent us there, and our own visit, or if the E Team works on Saturday days. AVOID."
James D.,/user_details?userid=fC8bLhTnxVT5_PL0wgTbaQ,"Nashville, TN",11/18/2016,3,"Had a reservation on a Friday night and the table was ready when we arrived. Service was great. The appetizers we had, tuna avocado salad, wings and fried cheese really great.  I wasn't  a fan of the duck bowl or crunchy shrimp entrees. Duck bowl just ok, bit boring and have had much better shrimp roles in other places. The special martinis, saki cosmo also seemed a bit short poured.  If you use a small glass you should fill it to the rim for price. Good ambiance and nice to get seated quickly though."

I'm very picky when it comes to Japanese food since I grew up in Tokyo, but this restaurant is hands down the best Japanese restaurant I discovered in a while. Very fresh Sashimi, amazing robata veggies and meat, great sake, cocktails and super yummy desert. Black cod Saikyo Miso Yaki is to die for! I almost never go outside of the city just to have dinner, but I'm definitely going back there sometime soon. Amazing!!"

Tony K.,/user_details?userid=kPcHvhfWmAIU-Rb4n18-lw,"Brooklyn, NY",8/9/2015,1,"Sat at the bar and waited over an hour for anything to come out of the kitchen ( including a salad) asked repeatedly where the food was but the bar tender seemed too busy to be bothered and had no one backing him up. Finally we had to leave with only one dish of five making it to us. To add insult to injury they handed me a bill which I handed right back to the manager and explained why i wouldn't be paying it. They are a management / staff nightmare, as for the food... Guess I'll never know."
Edyta K.,/user_details?userid=snXj62M3moGvhx-MTxld7A,"Brooklyn, NY",7/21/2015,5,Good Japanese food! The drinks are very tasty as well. Very friendly staff. The restaurant is clean and you can see the cooks cook your meal through a glass window which is great. Great addition to the neighborhood!
Abbey S.,/user_details?userid=je7vzfTWlLxTkVJmNCr8JQ,"Brooklyn, NY",9/8/2016,4,"I've never tried something at Salt and Charcoal that I didn't like. Any dish with their Wagyu beef is excellent. The Umami Chicken Wings and Shrimp Crunch Roll are my favorite. And even if you're ""not a dessert person"" you should try the Waffle Mochi Ice Cream. You won't regret it. While the wait staff is a little... eager, the quaint space is laid out well, with an open kitchen where you can see how robata-style cooking works."
Mr H.,/user_details?userid=a9XFU3T4WWD4-iVnWlmuSA,"Brooklyn, NY",2/17/2017,5,"This was my second round at this restaurant and it was well worth it. My first experience was so so but the staff and food quality truly shined the second time around. My specialist (waiter) Johnathan had some true knowledge about the menu and drink pairings for each dish he recommended. I even worked up the courage to try a damn sea urchin. Their twist on the urchin is flavorful and honestly worth a try. The octopus and steak was cooked perfectly over the Japanese charcoals but it's how the subtle ingredients are used with one another that make each dish standout. Here's the thing, I've eaten at many restaurants (high end + low end) and usually leave feeling a little robbed at times either by the quality of food or service. The people here care about the experience provided. I saw the chef watching me with anticipation and confidence from the corner of my eye as I took the first few bites of the steak he prepared. Open kitchen by the way so you get to see how clean things are at this place. I hate dirty kitchens. Hoping my next visit is just as memorable."
Tom N.,/user_details?userid=bM1GQFGnRA_QLz508sQB5g,"New York, NY",2/4/2015,5,"In one word: excellent. The food is superb. The ambiance is warm and inviting; very cool, very fun. The waitstaff is knowledgeable and down-to-earth. The beverage selection is intelligently compiled with great cocktails and fantastic sake. Prices are more than reasonable, especially given the high quality of food. I read some of the other reviews and did not find the same experience as those who wrote negatively. There are great deals here, like the Wagyu Roll for $15 (Wagyu!) and 5 appetizers in The Daily Starter for just $12. I highly recommend Salt+Charcoal and look forward to my next culinary adventure there."
Aaron F.,/user_details?userid=bCBMjj5L8KSAH9KI5GScqg,"New York, NY",5/5/2016,4,"great food and service.

Charles G.,/user_details?userid=0LU-BuV8XxUf9dcV3tVNLg,"New York, NY",6/19/2018,2,"I ordered eggs and Canadian bacon for brunch - when it came the bacon was actually pork belly - and VERY fatty pork belly at that (i looked it up online when i got home and it was clearly not Canadian bacon) - and the eggs were so salty I didn't eat them. The rolls were nice and the miso soup was ok. Our server was cool and nice and I left her a proper tip as it was not her fault that the food was poor. In our party of 5, three people were pleased with their meals, one was just ok and mine was a write off."

It's worth asking the server questions to learn about the cooking style and the type of food to expect. It's definitely a small plates style restaurant, but the portions were actually quite big compared to other small plates experiences we've had (especially in Manhattan!). I wouldn't say it's inexpensive, but you absolutely get what you pay for - great food. We had several small plates and a few cocktails each and with a 20% tip we still were under $200 for the night. We are already thinking about when to go back!"
Amber M.,/user_details?userid=YNbk7W0DvqxueBOfj2Rn1g,"Brooklyn, NY",8/15/2015,3,"Contrary to many reviews, on a Friday night around 8:45 we had no issues with long waits for food - everything came out at a reasonable time. Service was friendly and able to answer our questions. We tried the cocktails - pretty good, the Yuzu Mule was a bit sweet but flavorful. The food overall was very tasty - especially the Ebi shrimp toast appetizer, so good! We had the Wagyu beef and Black Cod for entrees- while both were delicious as other reviews mentioned the portions were terribly small. $28 for the cod which was probably only 4 Oz. and some Quinoa on the side felt like a rip off. I would come back for an appetizer or the sushi but it's just too expensive for such small portions to come back regularly."
Matt H.,/user_details?userid=B3Toizy0quqjYPFbl4nI0A,"Brooklyn, NY",11/23/2014,3,I guess I should have listened to the negative reviews. Portions were small and lacked flavor. The skewers were nothing special. Wagyu was delicious but it's Wagyu so it better be. Warm tofu was good too. Waiters were friendly but lacked knowledge of the menu. Prices were high relative to how unremarkable the food was. We tried it so now I can say I tried it and don't need to go back.

And we felt stuffed and a little bit sick when we finished it.. If they offer smaller size like around 20oz, that would be perfect."
Ken Y.,/user_details?userid=mHF_uBtnpMCqcbHXTlRJFg,"New York, NY",8/17/2015,4,"Loved it. Not in Williamsburg that much, but went with a local who lives close by.  She had not been there either. Inventive, fresh, Japanese cuisine. Not a sushi place per se, but has sushi offerings. We had smoked mackerel, sliced, on sliced daikon radish. Also al dente udon with minced pork in a delicious flavorful broth, unagi rock, a terrific platter of eel sushi and duck breast, each thinly sliced piece was wrapped with radish and carrot.  They have a full bar and service was great, I/we'll be back."
Michael V.,/user_details?userid=S36wq6hYUKCqhGLJ7yXyng,"New Hyde Park, NY",7/12/2017,3,Came despite recent mediocre reviews.  Most of the recent complaints by others are accurate.   Food was decent but service was weak.  They definitely need more people working there.  Otherwise there are enough places in the city with similar food.
Susan M.,/user_details?userid=3E74ZMQvOmbbSD8pOLvB4w,"Brooklyn, NY",11/19/2014,3,"Tasty, but like some other reviewers said-small amounts of food for large amounts of money. I will be back accompanied by someone with an expense account. Comfy chairs at the grill bar, fun to watch the chefs at work"

Marie P.,/user_details?userid=8OxHrU4jWYVzE0CD6yzh9g,"Brooklyn, NY",3/19/2016,1,I asked the waitress what I should order and she recommended two market price items. They were okay - waygu beef and sashimi salmon. The beef ended up being $50 for a small plate. Absolutely livid. I wanted the $18 pork and rice and she directed me to the overpriced and waygu. I wasn't pleased with the food but more importantly I spent $80 on small plates and am ordering food on the way home. Avoid.
Frank R.,/user_details?userid=8nNunq7-p020s9CNnvEdkg,"New York, NY",7/20/2015,5,"Great place to eat, chill catch up with friends. This place is an a awesome part of the city. The food is outstanding, that is what Keeps me coming back for more. Love the food!!!!"
We Ate T.,/user_details?userid=cH0VpQusvJ0i9D8LOCnIhA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/4/2015,3,"We wanted to like this place, great location cool interior and a nice menu.  We went here for dinner and saw that there were entrees and small bites.  My girlfriend and I each chose a entree but wanted to make sure we had enough food.  The waitress suggested we add one of the small bites to our meal  she was very helpful.  Once we got our food things were promising, we got the small bites chicken which ended up being this huge portion.  It was hot a crispy and very good.  Then my girlfriend's shrimp tempora can out and after searching through the plate there were no shrimp.  The waitress confirmed and got shrimp cooked as fast as possible. It was ok when it arrived and the vegetable s we 're not crispy.  I got the pork belly over potatoes and the size of the plate made me feel like Andre the giant. There were two triscuit size pieces of pork belly and a tiny baby sized mound of potatoes.  Both were amazingly flavorful and would love to have again but for an entree price we got a appetizer size plate. I even thought maybe I ordered off the wrong  section but I didn't.  If it was full sized I would say def get it but the portion was out of whack.  If we had not gotten the extra chicken we would have went home needling more food.  The flavors are all here and the food is pretty good but the portion size and pricing knock it down. Will consider trying again if these improve"
Moo P.,/user_details?userid=ZcJtaWB_CUw73d3SisTHng,"New York, NY",2/6/2015,5,"This place is seriously awesome, I can't believe the bad reviews. My boyfriend and I live nearby so we came in last week for some dinner. Everything was great, from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. We loved sitting at at the kitchen counter where you get to watch the chefs cook robata on the charcoal grill. Our server was really sweet and helped us pick a great sake. Favorite dishes were the salmon sushi roll, the seaweed salad, the kenchin soba, and the nasu eggplant. Oh and the matcha chocolate cake was my dream dessert. I definitely wanna come back to try the robata skewers next time!"
Sally H.,/user_details?userid=yNWbIoAX-SmHqPd2FNuGwA,"Brooklyn, NY",4/1/2016,2,"This place should get higher stars but the service was terrible. We dined early on a Friday evening. The waiter and staff kept wanting to take our plates asking 'if we were done'    The restaurant started to get a bit full but still wasn't crowded yet. We felt rushed the whole time. The food was just okay, the sake presentation was good and the downstairs bathroom was nice. There are too many options in the hood that I will not settle for bad service."
Ivo S.,/user_details?userid=yrThA1cqAR1oLhKZGMjYbA,"New York, NY",3/25/2015,4,Uni Shooter appetizer is A MUST! A truly excellent restaurant in Williamsburg. The setting and decor are a bit intimate so I recommend it for dates or smaller groups. The food is delicious but I must give 4 rather than 5 stars because I don't think the prices are justified. There are great restaurants in the area that offer good food and are more competitively priced. Highlights were the foie gras and the cod. Their specialty salt+charcoal cocktail was spicy heaven!
rachel m.,/user_details?userid=JK_JlzPsH5xSpizT6KhvCg,"Brooklyn, NY",5/8/2015,4,"Very good izykaya. The menu is extensive and everything we tried was amazing. I was with one other person and we wished we had more people with us so we could try more dishes. I always love seeing Chūhai on a menu! Wagyu rib-eye roll was delicious and presentation was lovely, came with a sesame risotto. The homemade soba was great, and the Shiogama Scottish salmon was one of the best pieces of salmon I've ever had, very tender, presented in a salt shell to preserve moisture and cracked table side. Will be back to try more!!"
mark f.,/user_details?userid=Z8lR2kDDcc1jb6vkIxiJAg,"New York, NY",1/17/2015,4,Excellent food and service.  Perfectly seasoned and cooked meats...Just need to work on the pace of delivery.  Slow is very in right now...
Jason S.,/user_details?userid=fIy5zKHYxl8dEsV0jYLsfA,"Brooklyn, NY",11/1/2015,5,"Went out for Halloween and found this spot by accident. Got lucky cause the menu is original, the service at the bar was on point, and the quality of the food/drink was superb. The variety alone will have us returning - we like Japanese robata style cooking while drinking at the bar, maybe this can be considered Japanese tapas? Anyway, this place is a gem and we're psyched to have found it. Certainly coming back."
Kait C.,/user_details?userid=bihf_gLyXo4mjNYl-f2Dlw,"Austin, TX",2/10/2015,5,"This place is wonderful! Really! I came here last weekend with a friend and we started at the bar had a few cocktails made by a really welcoming bartender (Alexa?). The yuzu mule was sooo good! We had the shrimp crunch roll while waiting for the table and it was definitely one of the best shrimp crunch rolls I've had. Not your basic boring one but really flavorful! Once we sat down we had the warm tofu, the pickles, the selection of 7 skewers,  the chicken meat ball, and some soba noodles. Everything was incredible! The skewers where my favorite this followed by the chicken meatball. The restaurant was pretty full when we went but our server was so nice and accommodating. She made sure to explain a few of the items would take a while to cook, but that was no problem at all! We just sipped on some excellent hot sake while waiting! If you go definitely get the wagyu skewer! It was my favorite!"
M L.,/user_details?userid=-9xc2UfLsv8H60FB3XdsXw,"New York, NY",2/14/2015,5,"I came here for their Valentines Day prix fixe which was an incredible steal at $60 for 6 separate courses each.  My bf and I got the meat and fish choice. My favorites included the chicken nanban zuke, the rabataya rolled wagyu skewers, cod (didn't lie the grilled veg with it.. They were still too raw), the house made soba, shrimp roll, and the green tea cake and mochi and green ice cream.  I didn't like the wagyu roll (the jalapeño on it was overbearing). Our non Japanese waitress was very sweet and knowledgeable about the food despite how authentic Japanese it was ( the robataya uses charcoal and wood from Japan and the kitchen staff is Japanese). The space is beautiful and the open kitchen is very clean and had a great vent system... We sat right next to the open kitchen and we didn't smell like food at all!  They tried to seat us downstairs but I requested to be over by the kitchen booths. I wouldn't recommend downstairs for a date. It's better for a private party.  Will definitely recommend this restaurants to my friends and be back myself."
Avril B.,/user_details?userid=o94Q72iuDIZqqEEP-4IiuQ,"East Bronx, NY",2/9/2015,5,I went here with boyfriend. We had a great time.

Michael M.,/user_details?userid=aJnQ4fFAX-K5m3INDXVi3Q,"Brooklyn, NY",11/15/2014,5,Amazing food. The best beef Wagyu rice and shrimp toast I have ever had.  The quail eggs are a must.  Our server Alexa and the rest of the staff were wonderful.  Highly recommend for food and staff.
Sarah T.,/user_details?userid=s3gFq0RG5MiVMRXduu4L7Q,"Brooklyn, NY",8/4/2015,1,"Waited an hour and a half for delivery. When I called, they kept telling me it would take ten minutes. Then I would calle 30 minutes later and they told me the same thing. I don't know what it's like to eat here, but make sure you never order from them. Many other options in Williamsburg for good sushi."
Steven J.,/user_details?userid=vGQYf1L8kgKryfH7gIzC9g,"Brooklyn, NY",7/28/2015,5,"I am so happy that this place opened because I live just a few blocks away form the restaurant. I walk by there everyday and I see the beautiful marquee sign. I've been wanted to try this place for a while, so finally we went in last weekend. My wife and I had an amazing dinner there. Place were nicely decorated and servers were very helpful. We chose Omakase for two. Start with hand made tofu, then Sashimi, Grilled fish, Grilled meat, Sushi and so on. Everything tasted amazing and very authentic. I am so glad that we don't have go in to the city to have this level of quality Japanese food. We will be back very soon!!!"
Lauren G.,/user_details?userid=M5sIMiG8YRL9WZcKQClOYA,"New York, NY",4/22/2016,5,Love this spot!! Great food- have never had anything I didn't like from the menu! The fried chicken is insane! Great drinks- watch out for the  Oolong hai! The staff is amazing- super friendly and efficient and the vibe is just right. Check it out for yourself!
Monika N.,/user_details?userid=iilqjMLIrCp9PEQPpkg5Qg,"Brooklyn, NY",2/9/2016,5,Mellow lunch. Terrific service. Charming but not cloying atmosphere. Excellent unagi roll- the miso soup that came with it was good too. Haven't been here in the evening but I'm really impressed by the beauty and chill of this place - I work nearby and will make it a regular spot for sure.
Ev E.,/user_details?userid=GX5nkqsgDMMoYMCLbkLarA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/29/2014,3,"i came back during opening week.  i expected service to be rocky, and it was.  all the food we ordered was good, but i felt it was really overpriced considering the portion size.  i'm talking like a regular mushroom skewer (nothing fancy like enoki) came out to over $1 per small, sliced piece.  the salt baked fish had excellent texture and flavor, but the portion wasn't even an FDA standard meat/fish portion (it was smaller than a size of playing cards).  i also wasn't in love with my small, pricy glass of sake.  one star off for the inflated price.  i'd definitely be a regular if they either lowered their prices slightly or made their portions bigger!"

The waitress was super nice and accommodating and let me charge my phone since it was about to die :/. Then o order The mezcal drinks which was well AMAZING! So I had two Hahaaha  of course. For lunch I had the shrimp tacos!! They were huge!!!! They were so good I wish I had more hahaha but I had to go! Definitely recommend this place! :)
Erin C.,/user_details?userid=XPfy0tSkgoGA2YNf-TXBzQ,"Brooklyn, NY",12/26/2022,4,"Sunday brunch for 2. I'm not sure if it's inflation but $28 for duck confit chilaquiles (add egg) is a bit absurd especially for the amount of duck that is in the dish in proportion to the tortilla chips. Flavor was good though! You do pay for the ambiance and it was just what we were looking for on a rainy afternoon. It was cozy, and we were lucky to get last minute seating at the bar. I've only sat out in the back garden before so it was nice to get this change of scenery. One thing to note, if you are inside, the kitchen is also open air indoors, so anything they are cooking, you will smell like it. Near the end of our experience, something was being charred and that really smoked up the joint and made us want to leave quickly."

Then check out Colonia Verde in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The menu is loaded with amazing plates like the Shrimp Tacos, Brussels Sprouts Caesar Salad and Duck Confit Chilaquiles. While I loved the aforementioned plates, my absolute favorite bite of the meal was their Little Piece of Brazil Dessert - yuca coconut cake topped with homemade whipped cream and lime zest. Warm, savory and just the right amount of sweetness for a dessert. A perfect bite if you ask me. Colonia Verde is definitely on my list of best kept culinary secrets of Brooklyn."

The carnitas taco was incredible - highly recommend to all. We can't wait to come back and eat everything else on the menu.

The churros. Eat them."

I finally went last night and it was a perfect crisp autumn night. It was the most romantic dinner I've ever been to. The dim lighting throughout the whole restaurant was to die for ! The food was amazing and after I ate my tacos I still wanted more. I could've kept eating all night. I wanted to try everything on the menu. The food was so flavorful and unique. The drink I had was perfectly made. Everything was perfect to be honest. The cozy atmosphere was my favorite part. I already plan to be back here next weekend. I cannot wait to go back !!!"

My personal favorite dishes are their horiatiki salad, lamb chops, tzatziki, & French fries. It's a really fun vibe, and a great place to come with a group of friends to share a couple of dishes."
