The tortillas are freshly made and you can choose flour or corn and of course you have chilé verde (green salsa) or chilé rojo (red salsa) and you definitely can't miss having a nice refreshing aqua fresca to drink on a warm summer day.

The corn tortillas, meat, chopped cilantro, diced onions, sliced pineapple,and guacamole tasted extremely fresh. Everything is made fresh to order. My favorite item was the chicken quesadillas on flour tortilla. The flour tortilla was perfectly thin and layered with an equally thin coating of cheese.

My personal favorite is Steak Especial, a fried steak quesadilla. They have a secret menu item called Queso Taco, a taco on a fried cheese surface. It's really good, but too oily for some people. The regular tacos are awesome, but you MUST get the especial, I usually order a taco and an especial when I go.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Rufus L. B.,/user_details?userid=7thkzzourlVrZXZdhOrxWA,"Queens, Queens, NY",3/7/2020,3.0,"I just tried this place for the first time and I'm not impressed at all. Granted, the meat(s) are juicy and well seasoned (especially the steak) but it just feels (and tastes) like it was all thrown together with no kind of effort. Their tacos are also very spicy, which can be a negative to some. Everything is fresh, so I guess that's a good thing, but that's about all I can say. While this place and their food didn't do much for ME, I'm sure others will enjoy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I've been to their Time Square location and I'm so happy that they opened one in TriBeCa near my job. Since I'm on keto I've been seeing on social media that they do a cheese crusted tacos with your preferred filling and all the works which includes cilantro, onions, guacamole and salsa. I decided on getting the chicken and let me tell you something; I'm glad I ordered this. The cheese was delicious and the juices of the chicken were overflowing. The best I've ever had. The prices on the tacos could be steep but you pay for what you get and you're in the city. Definitely come and check them out and if you're not by tribeca check their other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They also marinate and cook other meat in front of you as well. The tortillas are hand made on the spot and taste very good. The have both corn and flour tortillas to you to choose from. The meat is juicy and very flavorful. Finally the portions are good and you will probably be full if you get 3 tacos with chips on the side.
