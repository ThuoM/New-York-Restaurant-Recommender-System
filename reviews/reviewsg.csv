Doubles as a beer store but togo seemed to all go for $8 or more, so stick to drinking onsite. Tons of beers from the greats in NY like Barrier and Grimm. Heavy IPA available and all for $8-12. Got locals and easy to find mixed with the rates and all styles. Got full bar as well and wine and food (though kitchen closes before bar). Cold inside and can get loud but good beer bar feel.

When we arrived there was a little line and the hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait but it actually was only like 10 minutes before we were seated. It seems to be a favorite amongst the neighborhood and rightfully so. It's not a big indoor space but they do have outdoor seating . It's very charming and the staff is just wonderful and very welcoming. I started out wanting breakfast but quickly changed my mind when I saw the burger a customer was eating. Lol My daughter and I ordered the Jack's burger and my cousin ordered Jack's breakfast. For drinks we ordered the Mint lemonade and the Watermelon mimosa. No doubt, the burger was the best one I've had in a while. It was cooked to my liking which made it even more delicious.

My friend and I thought our meal was kind of overpriced for the portion sizes. None of the dishes were particularly impressive, but all of them tasted good. The green shakshuka was decent, but the amount of bread that came with the dish was not at all enough so definitely ask for more bread! We asked for an extra slice that we weren't charged for. The roasted cauliflower is pretty good, and the roasted capers add a delicious touch (even for my friend who dislikes capers).

Angel P.,/user_details?userid=xh1Je43_W0tdRQEAxJKApg,"New York, NY",1/3/2023,1.0,"This was my first time coming to this location and the service was horrible - rude, slow, at times nonexistent, and filled with micro aggressions. My friends and I visited for a double date that quickly went south once it came time to pay. It was very clear their card system was down. One card was taken, then another, then another and we were left sitting wondering what was going on when they swiped. After attempting to swipe several different cards (credit, debit, even gift cards) of different variations (visa, mastercard, discover) under several different names of our party, we were told their system was broken (which was obvious at this point). We gave them several more cards which still didn't work, then the manager came over to tell us everyone else's cards were working except ours which was a wild implication to make considering no other party was leaving or paying at the time and we were the ONLY Black table in the restaurant. Instead of attempting to figure out what was wrong with their system (perhaps restarting it, retyping our order, literally anything besides just swiping) or offering us anything for the inconvenience while we sat an extra 20 minutes for them to figure out their system or providing us with more insight and options as to what was happening, the manager made a member of our party get up, leave the restaurant, and walk to an ATM to pay in cash. Again, we were offered nothing for our inconvenience. To top it all off, the manager came back before we left and was very rude and confrontational. I've been to this franchise several times and typically have a good time, but will definitely not be returning to this location. The BK location is a lot more friendly so unless you have a more ""diverse"" crowd (if you get what I mean), I'd skip out on the 8th Ave location. Even a better demeanor or offer of dessert or shots would've gone a long way all inconveniences considered. But considering the comments made about what ""other tables"" were doing, it's clear they were making shady assumptions about our party and have a specific demographic they prefer to accommodate. My partner was very sweet and still tipped which is more than I would've done for such a hostile and shady experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/jacks-wife-freda-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Riley K.,/user_details?userid=lK7qCrQ0kkPfLA2Un41gHA,"San Francisco, CA",1/20/2023,3.0,"New York, to be honest...not my favorite place. Yet, this restaurant proved itself to be a memorable place. First of all, we went in with no reservations, but still got seated rather swifty. Right off, the waitress greeted us wonderfully, complimented my shirt (it was indeed a good shirt, my most recent hysteric glamour purchase), and my lashes (also indeed a nice pair of lashes, which I will not name the brand of because I am a gatekeeper oops!). I ordered the prego roll, with grilled halloumi and avocado added on as per the recommendation of the wonderfully perfect waiter. I also ordered the cantaloupe juice, which I really do not recommend. Incredibly bland and normal tasting, for 8 dollars... I was expecting a much more dramatic taste. Anyway, the food was again really just fine. I mean it was a meat, cheese and avocado sandwich. Have got to say, their green sauce is absolutely impeccable! Honestly, go here for the nice, clean environment more than the food. A little side note, that I think really made my experience memorable is the fact that right behind our table, there was a nice mom and young son duo. The mother, she was quite the angry andy. They were reviewing math, addition to be specific, and oh me oh my, she was very frustrated at her son for failing to understand 7+8. I have got to say, I do blame the mother, she was not a good teacher at all. This entire encounter  made me think about this quora post I saw, where I read many people from the East Coast think of CA people as less intellectually capable, and more lazy. Which is probably true, but as a CA resident myself, I was excellent at addition, and in fact excelled to learn about multiplication and division in the first grade. Will I ever come back here?

Wide variety to choose from on the menu but I just ended up going with the mediterranean breakfast. It was good but in my opinion not worth the $16.

I was craving a big and classic breakfast. My fiancé and I were a walk-in and they were able to sit us under 5 minutes. That was a plus! Our server was very friendly and attentive. I ordered Jack's breakfast with my steak done medium well and my eggs sunny side up. Overall, I don't think the portion was suitable for the price in which you pay. My meal was good but nothing took it over the top that made it stand out aside from the green sauce. When I got my plate there was one slice of toast on it. I thought to myself where is the other half. Lol. I asked my server about it and he said bread is unlimited so he brought me a few more slices which was cool but I thought it was odd to serve someone just one piece of bread as bread being unlimited may not come to one's mind since it's not really advertised. The bread was not toasted at all. I did not try any cocktails from the bar as I drank the previous night so I got a latte instead. The latte was served cold. I asked my server to have it warmed and without no issue he had a new one made. After the fix, I enjoyed the latte as I am a fan of Stumptown coffee.

They're not doing anything extraordinary, but serving really good simple, healthy-ish food that's always well-executed. My default is the chicken kebab with couscous (the chicken is NEVER dry), but also love their greek salad and the steak and eggs. And the add-ons here are bomb: the pickled onions, house hot sauce, and the spaghetti squash are so good. I keep buying jars of pickled onions so I can have more at home! Service can be a bit touch and go depending on how busy they are on the weekends, but usually food comes out very fast.

Decent drinks and desserts are pretty good too. If you have a sweet tooth their dessert is just right, not overwhelmingly sweet. I really enjoyed their Flourless Chipotle Chocolate Cake and I still think two sharing one is enough. I don't think I can finish the whole thing, it's pretty rich. Most of their items on the menu are all very tasty the only problem is I'm always half full when I eat a dish. The price is pretty reasonable, just seriously wish there's more.

When I think about the general idea of a restaurant, memories of here come to mind. The platonic ideal of cute, cozy manhattan restaurants. It's not too cheap or too pricey, too stuffy or too modern, too casual or too glamorous, too cramped or too open - it's not too anything. It's just right. Cocktails - great. Food - all of its good. Service - never been bad. Price - just right for what you get. Always happy when I leave this place. Probably each thing you can get here can be slightly more perfectly executed, and probably is, somewhere else in the city, but almost no restaurant can do each thing this one does so nearly perfectly all at once. If you're on the fence, definitely go. The one and only problem is that you will not be the first to discover this place - it can be crowded with a decent wait on popular nights, but just plan accordingly.

The waitstaff was friendly and very helpful and knew a lot about the food and beverages on the menu. It was nice to see that they didn't look rushed or overworked.

I must admit there were a few discrepancies that tainted my meals with them but those reasons are minuscule to the food. The first thing I must say is that they have the best prosciutto I've had in a while. It melts in your mouth like butter. Definitely the one thing on the menu I've had each time I've been there and it doesn't disappoint. The next best thing I would say is the Amatriciana, it was a beautiful experience, that dish. Apart from that the quick bites like the Polpette, the Barbabietola and the Tartufata pizza were just great! The pizza, I just didn't like how it was served, half way it got soggy due to the way it was plated. It should be served on something aerated to allow the crust to set properly. The air conditioning at the back on the left side, should be avoided in summer due to it being too strong, chilling your food faster. And on two occasions my servers and waiter forgot to place bread for the table. The drinks are solid and I repeat my visits regardless.

Beautiful ambiance, but the food was over priced and just not great. The standout for the meal was our appetizers--a beet salad ($14). My companion's caponata was just ok ($24). This foreshadowed trouble. Although pasta seems easy, it's not. My companion's squid in pasta ($35) was a tad overcooked and the and over sauced, so it overwhelmed the briney taste squid ink taste in the pasta. My Vongole ($24) had 8 of the most minuscule clams, and the pasta had no real distinction. We had to ask for bread (which was delicious) twice. The wine was good- a nice Nebbiolo ($56). Not great, for a total of $210. Very sweet waiter.

I dined here at the suggestion of a date and all I can say is that my date made a great choice. When we arrived, there was a slight wait even though we had reservations, but not too long. I believe we waited 5-10 mins. We were eventually seated in the downstairs dining room, which was very quiet, secluded and had a romantic vibe to it. We were greeted warmly by our waiter who took our drink orders and supplied water to the table. My date wanted me to try several dishes so we ordered the following. Sautéed asparagus, crabcake, thick cut bacon, potatoes au gratin, and lobster mac & cheese. All were delicious, well seasoned and hot. For our entree's I had the salmon which I liked very much, but didn't care for the mash it came with. My date ordered the Tomahawk steak medium which he loved. Overall it was a great dining experience and well worth the money spent.

While prices are on the higher end compared to other local eateries in FiDi & Battery Park, you can still make out okay with the right dish (sans alcohol of course). One of my ""go-to"" meals is the baked chicken served with mashed potatoes and asparagus in a scrumptious jus. The chicken itself is juicy with crispy skin on the outside and both sides leave you full but not overly so. If you're looking for a nice place to eat that's a little more upscale, this is a great place to try on the weekends when the busy work crowd is absent.

We had their signature Valentine's Day dessert and it was so good when you take a bit of all it ( saying the cake , piece of strawberry, white chocolate & whip cream ). We got a free dessert because the waiter didn't realize she order all steaks to be 8oz and one was suppose to be 12 oz (it's ok mistakes happen ).

I had of the burger done medium well and it was surprisingly flavorful (no weird smell that meat sometimes has) and still juicy! My husband ordered the steak (also medium well), and judging by his look of sheer and utter satisfaction on his face he liked his food as well! Despite being full, the smells kept wanting more.

I got the prime rib stroganoff and it was just ok. Lemon cake was very yummy! The waiter was very friendly. I was surprised how quickly we got our food based on other reviews about slow service.

The customer shouldn't have to  find the manager (assuming she even work there next time ) and then ask if she remember the statement.  Just my thoughts!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/del-friscos-grille-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

So what do I do, give the Grille a try. Plus my new job is down here so it was convenient. Had I known it was a lower end Del Frisco's I would've never went. We were seated upstairs which looks like a diner but with steakhouse prices. Although our server was very nice, the service was extremelyyyyy slow given that it wasn't even busy. Took forever for water or drinks. Got a grey goose dirty martini = nothing to brag about, Ordered the Prosciutto Di Parma flatbread = delicious! , got the Prime Ribeye = ordered medium rare, came medium but decided to just keep, charred broccoli with honey tahini = ok, truffles Mac and Cheese = amazing! So, lesson learned. If you're going to spend the money, pay a little more for a better experience at the Double Eagle.  Not a total bashing but once and done.

The steaks were cooked perfectly and I loved that the person who brought them over asked us to cut it to make sure it was cooked according to what we asked for.  The steaks were like butter just melting in your mouth, so delicious!  The truffle mac and cheese is a must, you have to try this, tons of cheese, crusty and delicious and the broccolini was also good.  I can't say enough about Annie who really made this experience great.  I figured that we would be rushed since it was Valentines Day but we were anything but rushed.  We were so stuffed we took a piece of their lemon cake home.

Jonathan K.,/user_details?userid=KSkX7yV5TqICa_FXatPpcg,"Staten Island, NY",7/7/2017,5.0,I have been to the new del friscos grille downtown twice and it has been above and beyond my expectations every time. The restaurant has a great cosmopolitan vibe with a contemporary decor and a great use of space. The staff greeted us warmly and let us hang out at the bar and outdoor patio while we were waiting for the rest of our party. Bartenders made the girls really yummy cocktails. First time I ate there I was in the main dining room and the second was a party in the private dining room. The food came out quick hot and delicious. The steaks got this awesome salty crispy char on them that gives way to perfect pink meat undernearth. Do yourself a favor. Get the truffle mac and cheese. And omg the dessert. I never liked coconut cream pie until this one. The managers were super nice too. Hooked it up with VIP shots. You are not finding this quality for this price at other steakhouse in the area. The private dining room is perfect for special occasions. I will be back for more tuna tacos for sure.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/del-friscos-grille-new-york-4?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Delicious! I ordered the burger, which was good, but my friend got the caesar salad and that look amazing. The caesar plate was huge and they do a great job of presentation.

Shannon F.,/user_details?userid=H8yJq7Dx3frsBjuXfsuQKg,"New York, NY",1/19/2023,4.0,"Zou Zous! Yum yum yum. Was in the Manhattan West area and stopped in for lunch and at 11:30 right when it opened they almost couldn't seat me and my friend because of how booked they were. So definitely come with a reservation, be okay with the bar or prepared to wait. The space itself is gorgeous and connected to the equally beautiful Pendry hotel. Was just here for lunch so didn't get a cocktail sadly but they looked amazing. My friend and I split the 3 dip dip tower and got the chickpea with black garlic which was delish and probably my favorite. The other two were whipped feta with apricot and roasted eggplant both were very good just on the sweeter side so be prepared if you are in the mood for salty.

My friends liked there's also. The tartar was okay, a unique dish but not one that was my personal favorite. The fried chicken was delicious but my partners didn't like the shell (fennel cups) that encased the lobster. The beef manti was the best to me. The sauce that complimented it was to die for. To close the meal was ice cream, but when it was served the waiter started to put olive oil (like cooking oil) on the ice cream. Really different wasn't the best tasting but not the worst at all.

I have a very cool mom who wanted a fun atmosphere with great food. Zou Zou knocked it out of the park and made us look good. We started with passed horsd' and each dish was better than the next. From the lamb meatballs, to the tuna cones to the moroccan fried chicken to the lobster roll. We then sat down and a plate of dips with truly the best pita I have ever had was placed on the table. We then each selected our starter- I had the fatoush salad which was amazing but too large of a portion. I then had the beef which was cooked to perfection. Our sides were the potato latkes and the broccoli. Can we talk about the latkes? With a roomful of critical Hanukah celebrators these latkes were voted the best they have ever had. Even my mom who makes a pretty good latke. We ended with a choice of two desserts. A lemon yogurt (super refreshing) and a chocolate pudding type dessert. That was my least favorite dish. But what also makes a great event is great service and each member of our team that night went above and beyond to make this evening truly special.

We decided to check this place out for a work happy hour. While we were getting our drinks we saw a mouse lost wandering around the tables. Since we're in the middle of the city, we assumed that it might scurried in the entrance so we informed the waiter but he didn't seem to have much care for it. We were a party of 5 or 6 using the bar area and ordered constantly, both drinks and food. This didn't seem to matter to the bartender because as soon as we stood up from some stools (if we are 5 paying costumers we are entitled to 5 stools), he asked to other costumers on a tone for us to hear ""do you want to sit?"" And pointed at our stools that also had our bags. He said to us ""they want to sit"", we moved our things and stayed standing while we were wrapping up. We ordered a drink for one of our friends and the bartender just replied with ""it will take a while"". It took long. However what bothered us about it was that our friend had half a drink left and placed the drink at the bar, the bartender took it away which seemed that given the other signs he was trying to rush us to leave. We had to tell him she wasn't done and he had to make a new one. Corporate happy hours are pretty pricey, we're not just ordering water and taking up space.

Iris A.,/user_details?userid=o1nGw2yl0TTN7bwTN2L3VQ,"Brooklyn, NY",8/26/2022,2.0,This has long been a neighborhood favorite however I have noticed the new staff do not wear gloves or hair-nets/caps which is a turn-off as hygiene should be prioritized. I never saw the old staff without gloves or hair caps. The pizza is still good but it would be nice if they retained the Italian authenticity rather than also trying to sell unrelated items like Jamaican patties for example.

Christopher D.,/user_details?userid=FlmbOQActBO1lfKNvtwgzw,"Brooklyn, NY",6/2/2017,4.0,Read about this new market in an article and decided to check it out.  It's has a variety of Asian foods and next to it has a bunch of local vendors.  Overall nice place to hang out as the design has a natural feel to it since it is modeled with a lot of wood and uses a lot of natural light.  Didn't stay to see how it is during night time.  Definitely will be back to try the other food vendors that I didn't get a chance to try.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/canal-street-market-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Dan K.,/user_details?userid=bOWIB-b-UlRr9CweTxOxAQ,"Albertson, NY",5/26/2017,4.0,"The food court at the Canal Street Marketplace just recently opened and got to check it out. The place is brand spanking new so it's clean and pretty hipster. I wanted to try the ramen, which is by ippudo, but going to save that for a colder day. There were a number of other fast casual oriented choices with a seating area in the back. Ended up at Oppa, the Korean barbecue place. Basically, it's bulgogi beef, spicy pork, sesame chicken (no, not the breaded and fried Chinese version), or tofu in your choice of burrito, rice bowl, salad, or mini tacos format. I went with mini tacos since they're sold individually and I could try all the different meats. They all come with some combination of chopped lettuce, kimchee, carrots, tomatoes, and sauces. Here's the kick - as any true Korean BBQ lover knows, KBBQ is best when the meat gets a little char on it, caramelizing the sugars to add a sweet taste. Oppa flame torches the pre-cooked meat right before serving it to you, imparting the goodness of Maillard reaction! Genius! I thought the blowtorch would leave a fuel smell, but not here. Note to the wise, the mini tacos (soft corn tortilla) do not travel well because of all the juiciness - eat it there if possible. Otherwise, expect a bit of a mess. Basically, the sauces make the whole thing taste pretty good. Of the three, I would have to say that the spicy pork was the best. It had a nice heat without being overwhelming. The kimchee was actually pretty decent for not-homemade. The staff was hustling and grooving to keep the line moving. The one guy who torches all the meats was clearly working quickly but he was paying attention, so props to him. Plus the food is served in a container that claims to be fully compostable! All in all, definitely warrants a return visit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/canal-street-market-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

After grabbing a bite, take a stroll around the flea market to look at some creative and hippy artwork and cool handmade goods. There'll sure be something interesting you'll find that will strike up a funny conversation and some light humor. Overall, pretty cool place to walk around and chill. I would come back to try some other items that I missed next time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/canal-street-market-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Angela W.,/user_details?userid=gS2ApQ039FJx-Yd-F5nw9A,"Livingston, NJ",1/26/2023,5.0,"I can confidently say that this is one of the best ramen places in NYC. This might even be one of the best that I've ever had! The line for this spot goes by quickly, and I only waited for 15-20 minutes on a Saturday around 2pm. You order online and they bring out the food super quickly since the menu is small. There are only bar seats as well so it's very intimate. The tsukemen is a fishy and porky broth, so if you don't like fish it might not be for you. The noodles are super thick and chewy and hold onto the dipping broth so well. The Tontori was extremely delicious. The broth is rich, and the thin noodles pair well with it. The pork chashu is juicy and tender.

Sophia N.,/user_details?userid=G6Ojom7BQfAYy246O2uHjg,"Asheville, NC",1/20/2023,3.0,I've been to the original store in Atlanta and I was surprised by some of the differences. This store has a small selection of the noodles compared to the Atlanta store and doesn't have any side dishes like gyoza. They also only have counter seating so going with a larger party may be difficult. The noodles were ok and service was very fast. It feels a little expensive for noodles especially compared to the many cheap eats in Chinatown so I'm not sure that I will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/okiboru-house-of-tsukemen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Both times I went before opening on a weekend for lunch. This seems to be a good time because you can get seated right away and the line is much longer by the time I'm done. Tiny space. Very attentive service. I have to admit tsukemen isn't really my thing but I love how thick and chewy these noodles are. The dipping sauce is so thick it reminded me of Japanese curry.

Jane P.,/user_details?userid=KIyDifnT2JprVspkUH4IEg,"Washington, DC",1/9/2023,5.0,"First of all I want to say I am not a huge fan of ramen, but I finished the whole bowl. I am not a huge noodle person. Also, it was worth going super early and waiting in line for over an hour. Make sure you get there early or they will cut you off. There is very limited seating and they are open for a limited time. This is the dipping ramen noodles so the sauce is saltier and less soupy. I liked all the toppings inside of the dish. The pork was so tender and the egg was cooked perfectly. I was surprised that I liked the lime in the dish. Now I feel like I'm going to need a lime for all my ramen bowls. The eggs was cooked perfectly. It was had a nice yoke that was runny but firm. I especially loved the fact that the noodles were thicker. It didn't taste like ramen noodles. It was closer to a udon noodle. The noodles soaked in the broth perfectly. I got an order of the hot sauce and I think the hot sauce is worth the extra price because it add a nice kick to the meal.

I knew there was a wait so came early (around 12:30pm) but clearly not early enough. You definitely have to come here by 12pm to be let in for the first seating. There's no vegan or vegetarian options since there's only pork or chicken. I like how everything is automated though since you order and pay by phone which makes the place very efficient. I ordered the  spicy tsukemen which was pretty spicy. I used only half the chili paste. The noodles were freshly made, bouncy, and had a good chew. They do use flour from Japan (has more proteins). The soft boiled egg and chashu were perfectly cooked. The dipping broth was flavorful and they give you a lot (I guess in case you want to order extra noodles). I want to come back but maybe in 6 months when hopefully there's a shorter wait.

I tried the tsukemen with pork chashu and ajitama. I would recommend putting all the toppings in really early on because the broth gets cold 10-15 minutes later.

The broth was so flavorful and decadent. The pork that topped the bowl... I wish I could've order extra to go. It was packed with flavor and had the perfect char. 10/10 would recommend and have again. The reason I only got 4/5 stars is because the seats are extremely uncomfortable and the space is tight.

There is only about 2 choices to pick from. I ordered the spicy one and added an additional egg to my dish. They give you water. Small restaurant, there isn't a lot of seating area where you are facing each other. Noodles came pretty quick. I googled how to eat Tsukemen before my dish came. The difference between ramen and Tsukemen is that the noodles come separate and cold. You dip the noodles into a broth that warms it up. I thought the broth tasted like curry a little. The spicy sauce came in another little dipping dish that I added to the broth. The noodles were good. Texture was good and tasted hand pulled/made. One downside I would say is that the broth got cold before I finished my noodles so towards the end it wasn't as good. It was my first time eating Tsukemen and I think I prefer ramen so the noodles stay warm and I love drinking broth. I did not drink the broth, I felt it was too thick.

As many other reviewers have pointed out, it is a tiny restaurant (with about 10 bar stools and 4 tiny tables). I would not recommend this place for any party larger than 3. The menu is a prix-fix for two courses and they have a pretty good selection to choose from. The cocktail menu is great and we both enjoyed our drinks a lot. The food, however left much to be desired. Our 1st courses were okay and our second courses while better, were nothing to write home about.

Came here for my friend's birthday & the prix fixe on the website didn't apply to us. We were forced to do this Family Style thing (which is just the whole table sharing some of the ""for the table"" appetizers/starters on the brunch menu and choice of entrée per person) that came with unlimited cocktails for $120 per person (ends up $156 per person with tax & gratuity) for 1.5 hours. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!! It'd be a different story if we were allowed to do the prix fixe brunch on the website, so go with a group of 4 or less. The food was good, but nothing spectacular.

I thought the food was good, but not phenomenal. I started off with pillowtalk, which was a nice fruity drink. We also split truffle fries among the table, which was yummy, but again, only as good as truffle fries from anywhere else. For my entree, I had the eggs benedict, which had poached eggs, thick bacon, and kale on top of arepas. It was good, but I think I've had better arepas. The kale and arepa did not have a lot of flavor and although the sauce was really good, there wasn't really that much sauce to make up for the lack of flavor.

Also, the service was terrible. The waitress wasn't very friendly... She also messed up on both my food order and my friend's which elongated the wait for our food. She also somehow managed to spill ketchup on another patron's hair. I don't know how but I looked up from biting into my burger and heard the waitress telling the patron not to move because she had a little ketchup in her hair.

I think they thought that it was being Inventive or ""different,"" but sometimes you just need to stick to the basics. The omelet was deFinitely not an omelet, more like a flat  potato mix with eggs. The burrata only came with one cracker for two people to share.... which means there were spreads still left on the plate - AKA Money wasted (and trust me this place was pricey$$!). The Bloody Mary I ordered was as I expected but virtually no spice to it - pretty bland. The cauliflower tots were good but I expected kind of lightly fried cauliflower.... this was more of a cauliflower purée inside a fried ball. Just not what we expected for the price. ANOTHER REASON this place gets a crappy review is because it is SO SMALL that they make you wait outside in the cold  until your entire party is there! When there were countless seats at the bar inside where people could comfortably wait! There are NO heat lamps either which.... come this winter... will be a real bitch for people having to wait outside in the cold!! The service was incredible and to our server... sir you were a joy!!

For our entree, I had a yummy burger and crisp delicious truffle fries and my friend ordered grilled beef tenderloin. The food was a 8/10, drinks a 10/10 and service 5/10. Now maybe we were overthinking, but we did feel very rushed by our waiter Steven and felt like he only kept asking us specifically if we were ready to pay. That was a tad bit annoying because no one else was waiting to be seated. He would ask for the check and say no rush but continue to rush us. He was very nice but kind of a non genuine type of nice.

Super small seating area (bar/window seating and 5 tables alongside 1 wall with 2 seats per table and maybe 1 table with 4 seats?). Bottom line= don't come here with a large group. You WILL wait/be disappointed and they don't seat you unless your whole table is present. My friend and I ordered the ""While We Were Young"" and the ""Something Fruity With Gin"" both $16. While We Were Young was the better tasting cocktail out of the 2 we tried because the gin cocktail was way too sour for our taste. For $16 cocktails I expected strong but delicious/pretty drinks but it was just decent. I think everything seems prettier than it actually is because of all the cute decor. After taking a look at the very limited and overpriced food menu decided to end our visit with the cocktails and eat somewhere else. I was also disappointed that I came here to take cute cocktail pictures and the rose bouquet at the bar area was yellowing/dying... aka couldn't get cute pictures. Would I come back again?

I ordered the avocado toast and truffle fries - $18 EACH which was def pricier than I expected, but it was quite yummy and I left full.

They also won't seat you unless your entire party is there. My friend arrived about 2 minutes after the last table for two was taken, so we ended up just sitting at the tiny side bar for Sunday brunch. The menu changes, so my avocado toast definitely looked different than the ones in the pictures on Yelp. The place is pricey: $18 for my avocado toast and ~$15 for the cocktails. Although the food and drinks are definitely ""cute"" and worth a pic, it's not really worth the price and atmosphere in my opinion.

Good.  Can't stop thinking about the squash.  The only con is that it is so so so small so my tall hubby could barely fit in the bench.  Most restaurants in NYC are small but this one seems teeny tiny so if you don't get here at the ideal time, you won't get a seat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/while-we-were-young-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It is very small so I can only imagine the headache it must be when it's a packed Saturday night and there's a wait. Well, thankfully, it was pretty empty this Friday Afternoon & that's just how I liked it. I was greeted by a Host whom I told I'm here for some drinks & waiting for my Wife to join me. He said ""Cool! You can have a seat at the Bar!"" I headed to the bar, ordered the 'While We Were Young' which was DELICIOUS!  I was able to take in the atmosphere waiting for my Wife as I enjoyed the cocktail. I'm all for good music playlists so that was a plus as well as the friendly Bartender. My Wife arrived & ordered the cocktail with Kale & how surprisingly delicious it was.

The drinks are really expensive and don't make much sense...the descriptors are basically just words that white girls like such as the butterfly peaflower vanilla puppies Beyoncé lulu lemon cocktail ($16) which is more expensive than some of the entrees. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were green for some reason (maybe kale? Matcha? Lemongrass? who the hell knows) probably because they were trying to trick my brain into thinking what I was eating was healthy. Like another reviewer, I found a hair in my food but I gave them the benefit of the doubt because we were seated on the windowsill so it could have blown in. The portions were a little on the small side but that probably works here because if you're larger than a size 4 you couldn't fit in the restaurant anyway.

I say sure go here the aesthetics are very pleasing although due to the blush pink velvet couch being used the couches are not the pretty pink they once were. They have maybe 4 tables and a half bar as far as the seating go. So this is great for small groups but if you're next to another party you guys might as well get aquatinted because the space is very ""intimate"". The drinks are AMAZING. Very cute drinks and the mixologist also did her thing! The menu selection although is not impressive to say the least. The menu was very limiting and not very appetizing.

I went with a friend and we shared the avocado toast, the chicken and waffles, and the truffle fries- all were excellent. The only hitch in our experience was that when we went to pay, I asked for a box for our truffle fries, and was told by the waitress that ""they do not offer boxes and people are not allowed to take food to go"". If that was the case, it would have been nice to know ahead of ordering so much food because we paid $18 for the truffle fries and barely touched them. It was pretty shocking to be told that you are not allowed to take home food that you paid for and would be able to enjoy later- it is also incredibly wasteful to discard food in this manor when customers are willing to take it home. Other than that it was a nice experience, however because of what happened I doubt I will be back anytime soon.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/while-we-were-young-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Likewise, the food and drinks were good, but the service wasn't great and it's difficult to eat when you're rubbing elbows with a stranger at every bite. All of this would've been manageable without the astronomical prices. I went with two other people and they wouldn't let us split two pre-fixe options. We were told that every person included in the reservation had to order a $45 meal (this wasn't in any kind of notice when I made the reservation or read the menu). What if someone just wanted drinks? I had a friend with me who just wasn't prepared to pay that amount but there were no exceptions. Then we couldn't even cancel the reservation without them charging us like $60. All of this plus $15 drinks each. We won't be going back or recommending this place to anyone.

We had a member of our party running late but the staff did not make us feel rushed at all which we appreciated immensely. Such a great and filling dinner! We got so many sides - all delicious. I personally had the Spicy Lobster Spaghetti which I worried would be a bit underwhelming compared to the rest of the restaurant, but paired with all the sides (roasted potatoes, mushrooms, asparagus) it was so wonderful. Would love to eat here again given I have the funds - it's a great splurge! (the mozzarella/caviar stick could definitely be split by two if you're just interested in trying it and are ordering additional appetizers)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/carne-mare-new-york-5?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Frantz C.,/user_details?userid=sn4LNAjO31vQi5lM_mRiKQ,"South Slope, Brooklyn, NY",3/27/2023,5.0,I went to dinner with my daughter to celebrate her being my daughter. We had a great time. The garlic bread is so fresh and hot and buttery with a great accent of garlic. The oyster mixture was so fresh. We had the mozzarella stick with caviar that had a great mixture of salty cheese and fish eggs. The octopus  dish was just as delicious. We tried the beef tartare and it was surprisingly delicious. We had never had beef tartare before. The spicy lobster  spaghetti was everything people wrote about. So goooooood. We had the broccolini which was seasoned to perfection. We also had the boneless rib eye medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. We finished the night with the 17 layer chocolate cake. What a great way to end the night. The service by Michael was too notch. The host Brooke was kind and gave us a great seat that would allow us to speak together without yelling. And the entire place is beautiful with a great view of the water.

Adina B.,/user_details?userid=HBDrZlOUCp3lznicq38NvQ,"Somerville, MA",7/18/2022,1.0,"I went to Carne Mare before a concert at the rooftop. We were so excited to enjoy a nice meal and drinks. While the restaurant was busy, we did see them accommodate other guests in a reasonable time. Our drinks took 30 minutes. And then a full hour went by with no food. We were probably 70 minutes in when we were getting frustrated. All the parties surrounding us who arrived 30 minutes after us had already received their food. We asked the manager to close our order of drinks so we could eat elsewhere. The manager came to give us our check while the food finally arrived. Rather than try to smoothe it over, he told the waiter to take the food back to the kitchen  and proceeded to give us our check. After seeing our frustration, he ended up canceling our drink charge and we left. Note to staff, accommodate all your guests equally in a reasonable time.

Being able to eat on the water in NYC is a rarity, but being able to eat steak on the water is an anomaly. We ate upstairs, where there was a sexy, sophisticated, and social atmosphere, but you could also eat outside. Drinks 10/10! Bread 100/10, delicious pull-apart garlic bread with parmesan. MUST TRYS: mozzarella sticks with caviar, yellowfin tuna tartar, milanese cowboy veal chop, side of polenta, and the 30-day dry-ages tomahawk, spicy lobster spaghetti. The spaghetti had just the right amount of kick and was prepared in a vodka sauce-like mix. The veal chop was perfectly crisp and not classically thin, which was nice. We also got potatoes rustica with parmesan and the farmer's salad. We ordered the sweet cacio e pepe corn, but it never came, which I was pretty excited about, but forgot about until after the meal. Also, I'm not sure if the meal was space out or the kitchen was backed up, but it was a 3 hour meal.

We live in the area and eat at The Fulton and many other high end restaurants. We were excited to try this restaurant and were there for a special occasion. The waiter barely looked us in the eye, never checked on the table, acted dismissive and ignored us all night. Had to ask a host, as she was squeezing behind my chair to get through to another table, to find our waiter so I could order a glass of wine. Worst of all, my $85 steak was gray and well done after I ordered it medium rare. 85 dollars for the wagyu. It may as well have been gray hamburger meat. I very patiently and politely asked to please have a new one and the waiter paused, picked it up, and said ""ok"" and walked away with a pissy attitude. He had a horrible attitude and made us feel tense and disrespected.  He didn't care at all, never said I'm sorry about that, or anything you'd expect. Very very shitty experience for $300. $300 included 2 drinks and no dessert. I try to support local restaurants, but this was a TERRIBLE experience. The one star is because at least the food is good, when done right, and a manager came out to give a half-ass ""sorry your steak wasn't right"". I ate my steak with cold sides and obnoxious looks from the staff.  The waiter paid us no attention at all, we never got a water refill in 2 hours, and he treated us like tourists who would never return. We won't. And I will let everyone I know to skip this place and go to The Fulton or the 1000 other steakhouses and better restaurants downtown. It was insulting and they made us very uncomfortable.

The mushroom cavatelli was delicious but a little salty for my taste and the pappardelle was wayyyyyy salty even for my partner.

Lauren H.,/user_details?userid=0tI0qaFmac-76BPviQ3PaQ,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/12/2022,3.0,"Walking in this place is so cute and I was so excited to try it but the cost just didn't match the food.  Started the night with an expresso martini which was excellent no complaints there. As appetizers my table shared the grilled octopus and blistered Shishido. They were both fine nothing to amazing. For dinner I got the mushroom Cavatelli which was really salty. I will say that it was good size portion though which I can not say the same for some of the meals my friends got. One of my friends got the Salmon and it was truly the smallest piece of salmon I have ever seen served, for 37 dollars I was a little surprised.  The service was really great though our server was really nice and one of the people I was with can't have gluten and she was really mindful of that and made sure to make a note of it on their order even though what they ordered should of been gluten free. The real thing bringing this down for me is just the cost of everything felt really high for what it was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/marians-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

To sum it up, we had Trapizzino on our last day in Rome and were blown away by it. I did a quick google search to bookmark the place for next time I visit Rome and was shocked to find out that there was a location in NYC! What, my dreams came true?! I can't believe it. So, one day, my husband and I came here for lunch and got the eggplant parm trap and the doppio e pane without the anchovies because we're both vegetarian. Also, the leek and tallegio suppli was DELICIOUS and better than the suppli we had in Rome! So, in short, I'm SO HAPPY this place is here and the food is amazing and it tastes just like it did in Rome. Also, this place has even more vegetarian options than the one in Rome did.

And while you would be hard pressed to find a genuine Italiano at any Piada location (a midwest based, Italian street food, fast casual joint that is rapidly expanding throughout the east coast), at Trapizzino, the guy who waited on us had the thickest Italian accent I had ever heard in person. Straight off the boot. Yes, boot, not boat. It was a pun, albeit a bad one. I wish it were bigger, but it hit the spot. The bread really makes the whole thing. And at $6.50 right in Manhattan, it's a great value as well. We also ordered a few of the suppli, which were equally delicious.

Super friendly staff, food was amazing, atmosphere was nice with the open front and bar tables, and free ice cold filtered water you can get yourself from the utensils/glasses area. The trapizzino we tried were 1. eggplant parm 2. beef ball 3. zucchini (I don't recall the exact names but these were the main ingredients of each one). Apparently the oxtail is one of their top ones, but they were out by the time we got there. Each one was super tasty, and the crunchy exterior of the bread ""pockets"" added to the flavorful filling. The suppli (a fried risotto ball) was my favorite part because of the saucy tomato rice that was packed inside a crispy shell. It was about the size of a small egg. For each person, I would say two trapizzinos to fill you up and it was about 6.50 each. $13 for a meal or snack is not too bad and it's definitely worth a try!

As i was walking by i was offered a free sample. I tried the Chicken Caccitore and was immediately hooked. I ordered the above and 2 rice balls, one PEPE and one with mortadella, they were both very delicious. The Chicken Trapizzino was the star though, the bread is made fresh daily and you can tell, a sandwich is only as good as the bread used. That being said the chicken was seasoned and a nice compliment to the bread. I'll be coming here often while the pop up exists and I highly recommend you do to.

Jessica T.,/user_details?userid=ptAVptn3aj78PRm-4tCqYQ,"Manhattan, NY",9/10/2017,5.0,"Thought all the dishes we got here were delicious. We started with a simple cabbage appetizer (lightly salted with some sesame oil / sesame seeds), which was surprisingly good despite its simplicity. Chicken Nanban was amazing - sweetness of chicken (honey?) coupled with tanginess of the sauce was so addictive. We also had the garlic butter fried rice (was super excited for this and it didn't disappoint)- has little mushrooms in it. The fried scallops were good (great if you like scallops but I don't ha) and had a dipping sauce similar to that on the chicken. The tamago omelette was cute but probably my least favorite (though it wasn't intensely flavorful like the other dishes and provided a good break). The potato salad was standard (nice little crunchy bits of bacon? In there that was a nice touch) as was the salmon sashimi (probably will save sashimi for sushi focused spots in future). My favorite of the night though- definitely the Sukiyaki. The beef in that soup was so tender, and the noodles were fun (potato based like japchae but shape reminded me of ramen). I will say service was a little awkward (server wasn't great at answering our questions but more language barrier than rudeness), but ok overall.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/izakaya-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I loved the signature chicken nanban (fried chicken with a sweet mayo based sauce) the most and the quality of the food was high.

The omelette tasted really good but tasted like something I could make at home if I had proper ingredients. I really liked how there was cod roe in it and was slightly spicy. The Addictive cabbage was very okay. It tasted like a bunch of napa cabbage thrown together with sesame oil, sesame seeds, and salt. It wasn't very addictive for me. I LOVED the nanban chicken. It was very juicy and came with a delicious white sauce and a little bit of soy sauce. I also like how it came with a lemon to give the flavor a bit more of a kick. And by the time I got to the Neopolitan Spaghetti I was already too full to enjoy it but I love the egg on top of the pasta. The pasta itself was a  bit too sour and salty.

I visited last week to find out that something in their system changed. They used to be a non tipping restaurant (just like in Japan) supposedly paying their employees more than other places. I think that made for a great experience and prices (I thought) were right. A dinner for two, with at least 3 dishes per person, and a couple drinks usually came to 100/120. Now they did away with the non tipping thing. We were surprised to find that after we payed with a card there were three lines to leave a tip and add it up. Prices have stayed the same. So there's something weird here. Initially when they switched to non tipping they raised the prices and it made sense. Now, they did away with that but didn't lower their prices. Maybe this was a mistake or something they've added as an optional? I don't know. Not cool. Unless they change this in any way I won't be coming back.

I was around the area and made it in time before they stopped making the rice noodles. They stop selling at 3:30pm everyday. The rice noodles were made to order fresh. I like that there's many types of rice noodles to order from, whether it be beef, pork, corn, veggies or fishballs. I got the rice noodles with fish balls and egg. The egg was an additional charge of $0.50. The noodles were kind of liquidity. I actually prefer it to be more dense and glutinous. The fishballs were cut in half to be made with the rice noodles. I wished they were the whole fish balls that I'm used to. I've had better.

Would recommend staying away from the roast pork cuz you get just a few pieces of completely dehydrated meat product in the filling that tastes pretty odd. The fish balls were actually pretty good, although wish they could have been incorporated a bit more instead of sprinkled on top, but maybe that's just how the dish is eaten.

This place is just a window with a severely limited English menu on the door and an adorable woman on the inside cooking the rice roll from scratch while you wait only 5 minutes. And it's $1.50. And one is plenty for lunch. I ate two. So judge away. I had never even had a rice roll and now I have to make up for lost time. I had the vegetable rice rolls. I put tons of soy sauce on it and should have out more sriracha. Not because the rice roll needed spice to cover anything up but because it seemed to seep into the rice roll and deepen the flavor.

The egg sandwich consists of a perfectly cooked fried egg, cheddar and fried speck on a freshly baked biscuit. It was the best egg sandwich I've ever eaten! The biscuit was light and not greasy or overpoweringly dense or too big. The egg was just a tiny bit runny inside, the perfect consistency to soak into the biscuit.

Service (Andrea, Stefano and Mario) is fantastic, very attentive and welcoming. Wine selection is spot on, with one of my favorite $20 whites on the list.

Lilli S.,/user_details?userid=-UA3I1NQIdLZSy7ZHrJNKw,"Brooklyn, NY",7/21/2022,5.0,"I saw that the photos were beautiful on Yelp but this place is absolutely gorgeous beyond the expectations set. Tucked away in an oasis on Christie street, past a secret garden, then behind these two impressive escalator space portals to the hotel above. Both the bar/lounge and restaurant have plentiful, beautifully designed seating. And the entire establishment is adorned in greenery. It's like the rainforest cafe for sophisticated adults and unsophisticated foodies like me. I had to get the Popular Pisco Sour because when in Lima... one of the best cocktails I've ever had. I also had to try the classic ceviche which honestly blew my mind - the broth? Was so delicious and almost had a delicate chorizo flavor. The dish itself, all the dishes are absolutely beautiful. For entrees we got the shrimp rice which comes served in skillet, the sticky prawns (bigger than photos suggest! Definitely entree sized), the swordfish, and the market fish (striped bass with micro green salad and delicious sauce). We also got an order of yucca for the table (served two ways, fried and boiled? With another delicious sauce). The swordfish was my favorite entree - out of all the swordfish I've had, this somehow packed double the flavor. And since the fish plates come with just the fish (and a lot of garnish) - I would definitely recommend ordering some carbohydrates off the veggie section of the menu, and I do highly recommend the yucca which is just melt in your mouth. For dessert we tried the Neapolitan ice cream - my father in law is the number one ice cream fanatic and he was losing it at how good this flag of ice cream was. I tried it, it was pretty darn good and served really cool (in a rectangle). My boyfriend and I shared the baked Alaska which also blew my mind - covered in edible flowers and a graham-ish cracker cookie crumble, the meringue was marshmallowy and soft, piped kind of comically like the coronavirus (big spiky ball). Inside the ice cream was two flavors I couldn't identify but they were in the honey, graham-y world and almost cookie dough textured. It's a huge dessert, and I highly recommend getting it whether or not you have other people to share it with. Blown away by this magical place. It's expensive, but it's worth it! Also... not pretentious at all and very kind staff. I wish I had taken photos but I was too mesmerized. Excellent place to take a good friend for a birthday surprise :D",https://www.yelp.com/biz/popular-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They were very friendly and accommodating on the matter, especially with bringing the cake to the back ($10 cut fee pp). We all started off with some drinks, I got the pisco sour. It was one of the best I've had in nyc tbh. Additionally we tried two of the ceviches, one traditional and I forgot the second. Also very good, with just the right amount of cream and lemon flavor. For my entree I had the sticky prawn. My friends adjacent to me ordered the scallops and duck leg. All three dishes were amazing.

Worst E.,/user_details?userid=Xz6Zed2f_2VykkUkdeqOtQ,"Brooklyn, NY",11/17/2022,1.0,"Worst NYC restaurant experience ever. 0 stars. I was staying at the Public for a staycation and decided to have breakfast at the hotel before going home. The server and busser/runner working were absolutely lovely! The person I'm guessing was managing was THE WORST. I was there last Sunday (11/13) around 10:30am. Everything started out fine with the server. I ordered the bread and pastry basket and a side of eggs. When the runner dropped off the food, I was surprised by the bread and pastry basket (picture attached). I was underwhelmed and wanted to ask if I could get something else instead. I tried to get the runner/busser's attention but I figured someone would be back to check on me and I was hungry so I started eating the eggs (they were not warm but as I mentioned, I was hungry). I didn't see the server and the runner was busy but someone else came out on the floor who seemed to be the manager (I'll be referring to him as the manager) so I tried to get his attention. He was focused on a couple who had seated themselves (it wasn't very busy but the staff was struggling to manage the flow of guests). He told them ""I see you've seated yourselves."" They responded by asking if they could have coffees and he told them ""if you want coffees you can go over there. This is a full breakfast menu."" They responded by saying ""yes. This is where the hotel breakfast is?"" They had two packages of unopened cookies they had set on the table and he said ""this is a full breakfast menu and you can't have outside food in here."" Their response ""oh sorry."" They put the cookie packages away as the manager walked away from them. The runner came back and took their order. I was able to get the runner's attention and explain to him that I'd like something else. He took the bread and pastry basket away. The manager immediately came over and said ""We don't just order things and decide that we don't want them so I'm not going to be able to take this off your check. I can't resell this."" I hadn't asked him to and he didn't ask me what the issue was. I told him ""I understand it's wasteful and a hassle to send this back but I had expected something else. I feel like it was misrepresented on the menu and I would have sent it back right away had someone checked in but I was having difficulty getting anyone's attention."" He said ""Yes. It is wasteful and a hassle."" We went back and forth a bit and he ended by telling me ""I'll take it off the bill but just for YOUR future reference, we don't order things and decide we don't want them."" I have never encountered such a rude person in the service industry. I worked in NYC restaurants for about 8 years as a server, bartender, and manager. I know working the breakfast/brunch shift can be terrible but this guy was so rude to the couple next to me and to me. Also having worked in the industry, I know that ""we"" do send things back when they are not what ""we"" expected or wanted. I also know that it's pretty awful customer service to berate the customers. Having worked in the industry, I try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt but this guy was BEYOND. He was so rude that I created this yelp account and felt the need to write my first review ever.

Initially I was intimidated by the menu and I wasn't sure if I would like it but everything was so good! We started with gougeres which was cheesy and delicious. I didn't love the sauce that went with it (friend did). Then we had the cheese soufflé (so soft!) and the beets (my least favorite but still good). I had the salmon en croute which was really excellent. My friends had the risotto and fennel tagliatelle both also really good. We ended with creme brulee and cheesecake excellent. Our server was so nice and helpful. Ambiance was nice as well - I just didn't love that you have to walk through a hotel to go to the bathroom and had a totally different feel.

David A.,/user_details?userid=xAXjMh_tWvyPS1a957Dk9w,"New York, NY",11/5/2022,4.0,"I enjoyed but did not love Koloman, and this is not an inexpensive restaurant. We split the beets ""linzer"" and the Short Rib Tafelspitz Terrine. Both were very good. The beets were fairly basic, with a bit of linzer crumble strewn in, and some creme fraiche lining the plate. The terrine was a bit more interesting, and the flavors were nice. For mains, my pal got the Schnitzel (I found this a little greasy) and I had the beautiful -- and very tasty --  Salmon En Croute. The Salmon was faultless, but not thrilling. For dessert we split the soufflé with rum and lingonberries, and it was very good, but I was a little disappointed (am I being too picky) that it wasn't served in a soufflé ramekin but a shallow dish. The flavors were there, but the presentation was blah. I would be more disposed to love this place if it wasn't so pricey, but much like Frenchette (which I think is a more interesting and better restaurant) it's not a place I will visit regularly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/koloman-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The seats are a bit basic but you're here for the food and it does not disappoint. Servers are prompt and food comes quickly . We chose mild spice with added chili oil on the side snd the spice was perfect, not incendiary but very flavorful . We had a side of noodles which helps to reduce the spice and if you are timid to Thai spicing, I'd suggest that. We had two salads, which come to share, crispy fish over fried rice, and chopped mushrooms and mint, which comes quite hot and then another of the chopped delicious salads, your sever can help guide you.

Mackenzie A.,/user_details?userid=Sstm0vTyoge71CiJYsGdEw,"Foxboro, MA",10/11/2020,3.0,"I wanted to like this place, but it ended up being a disappointing experience, overall. We had a larger party and sat on the outdoor patio in the back. The aesthetic was super cute and fun, with beautiful stringed lights and nice patio furniture. We started off, or tried to, with an appetizer of the Crab Fried Rice. It didn't end up coming out until all of the other food did, but it was really good. Everyone enjoyed the fresh crab meat on top, and overall, I wish I had gotten just that as my meal. For the meal itself, myself and several others got the Spicy Pad Thai with Shrimp. Our main compliant here is that the wait staff said they couldn't tone down the spice level whatsoever for some of our friends with more sensitive palates. Additionally, our meals all came out at separate times, which was not great since the meals were all hot, so we couldn't end up eating together as a group. This restaurant is also decently new and don't have their liquor license yet, so it was BYOB, but this wasn't advertised until we sat down. Thankfully we did have some wine from a local winery, and the restaurant provided a wine opener and glasses. Also important to note, the service was very slow. We felt bad as there was only 1 server for all of the outdoor tables, but this led to an overall not great dining experience.

It's a small place and tables are close together, so it was fun seeing what other people had and making notes for future orders.

My goodness...we have good bagels in California, but I have never experienced a bagel quite like this! The bagels had a wide variety of flavors, and no exaggeration, were about 6-7 inches in circumference, 5-7 inches in height. I've never seen bagels that size! I ordered the onion bagel, with bacon-scallion cream cheese, and that led to another surprise. The cream cheese had actual pieces of cooked bacon and green onion in it (I was honestly expecting Philadelphia cream cheese or something)! The people making my bagel also smeared a good two inches of that stuff on each half, which made me happy. It's a wonderful place for a quick and cheap breakfast: I spent $7 for a coffee, and this wonderful piece of bagel art that kept me full until around 3 that afternoon. Definitely recommend, and will return myself next time I come to New York!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There wasn't an open seat in the house and they still found us a spot for 6 fairly quickly. We were impressed. Everyone's food was really yummy and the drinks, while a bit pricey, were strong and visually stunning. You could definitely tell everyone was working well together to make sure finished dishes were taken away asap as to get a more efficient turn over on tables, but we never felt rushed. There was a birthday song and lava cake involved that was rich and creamy! The street themed bathroom caught me way off guard, but it was super cool and ended up adding to my overall experience.

There is beautiful Japanese decorations and unique drawing on the menu to describe how each of their drinks are and how they are made. Their bathroom was also a very unique experience because of how they decorated it. While the decoration holds to be very unique and beautiful, everything else matters as well. Their service was top notch. The whole restaurant often greets the customers when they walk in and they are very friendly with everything to make yourself feel like home. However, the price seemed a bit higher in few items more than other restaurants around the area. I ordered ramen and to be honest, I wasn't really fond of it. My ramen came in a semi cold broth which also had no flavors, I had to add extra seasoning and make it edible. The noodles also lacked flavors and were kinda stretchy. Not really my type I guess. Maybe I should've picked a different both, something more popular but it didn't really hit the spot for me.

Amy A.,/user_details?userid=fBD6VOswB5Q5fypzb9HScg,"East Harlem, Manhattan, NY",6/22/2022,4.0,LOVE the ramen. Flavor is on point. Texture is on point. I also love the drinks here omg so pretty and innovative imo. The cha su pork is soooo well made I mean I literally pick the fat off usually in most ramen spots bc it's never cooked in a way that doesn't make me feel like it's just actual fat. Here it's caramelized to the gods and given a nice sear/char which makes it all melt together very pleasantly. It comes with a lil gold flake too lol so pretty for pics. It is a bit higher in price so be aware that this will be a well over $20 bowl accompanied by a $15 drink (you may need 2/3 LOL) but if you're down to splurge that's fine. Lastly the only part I really didn't love was the seating. The crate seats are really not comfortable at all and sitting in the middle definitely feels too crowded and like you're kind of just in the way. Wish I could call to reserve the window table (I've tried and when I arrived it was still taken by another party) :( either way tho the ramen is good and I do love the decorations and the vibe of the place.

I took my food to go but there's limited seating in the small cafe and based on the time you might get lucky and snag a seat. I'll start by saying this place is super cute and I love the way they decorated the place. The line moves fast and depending what you order you'll wait about 10-15min for your meal. I started with a $7 salted caramel latte which I immediately regretted because it tasted more salty than I expected so I guess that was an acquired taste. I then got the falafel burger and a side of spiced home fries. These two were absolutely delicious and I would definitely get both again. Portions were filling, seasonings were on point, and everything complimented each other very well. I finished it off with a mixed berry scone that was super tasty and not overly sweet. I gave this place a 4 instead of 5 because the prices were too high in my opinion. I spent like $40 which seems steep for what I got.

I gave it four stars because of the waitress, she messed up my and my friend's order and then said she's going to have them redo it and 25 minutes later we never heard back from her. If my friend hadn't gone to inquire I don't think we'd ever get our food. Later on in our stay, she was replaced by a lovely gentleman, so him and the food were the saving grace for this place.

It's quite snug inside; seating approximately 15 people on small stools. Clientele are majority gen Z and hipster aspiring, giving the place a high-school-cafeteria-in-a-shoebox vibe.

Ana A.,/user_details?userid=tIaHN9pVldzTtCUqbUPTSw,"Rapid City, SD",12/6/2019,3.0,This is more of a coffee shop rather than a restaurant. It's pretty small inside so be prepared to be a little squished in if you're planning to sit down and grab a bit to eat. Me and my friend got the breakfast plate which is $12.50. The food wasn't anything special. The best thing about the meal was the potatoes and bread. I rated it 3 stars because of price of the food and lack luster for taste. The coffee isn't anything special either. I can put this on my list of places I won't be returning too. Don't ask for ketchup because they don't have any.  The only reason I didn't give them 1 star is because their service is good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/golda-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The greens came with a vinaigrette and the steak and fries is presented together. Delicious. Steak was tender and charred so well. It is served with a peppercorn/herb sauce that adds another layer of flavor. The fries that are bottomless are served hot and crispy. The perfect accompaniment.

The fries were delicious and unlimited so I can't complain about that.

The complimentary bread was a nice snack followed by the house salad.  The menu is pretty much set at steak and fries and the salad has only the house dressing.  I ordered the blackberry spritz and my steak medium. The drink looked good but was truly lacking in the alcohol department so much so i forgot to take a picture of it lol. When the steak came out it looked amazing and smelled even better.

This place has a huge buzz and for 28-30$ for steak a salad and unlimited fries it is quite a good deal. I would suggest maybe drinking elsewhere before you come here to avoid the added expense of their cocktails, which were not very strong at all but packed a huge price punch of 15$ a piece.  In all i would definitely come back here, the food was very good and  the price cant be beat.

Edmond C.,/user_details?userid=SBL1yLcXBvXAxGV7r0jYdw,"Anaheim, CA",3/12/2023,4.0,"Skirt will become one of your ""go to"" spots to satisfy your steak and frites cravings. You can afford to return again and again; though, the basic price point has risen ten dollars or so since it opened. At the current price of $38 or $39, you get 8 ounces of skirt steak and all you can eat fries, with a salad to start things. The salad has become perceptibly smaller over the last year (and there were green or red peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes or some kind of other veggies in there when I started visiting, but they are missing now), but you will appreciate the endives and vinaigrette dressing, with cracked pepper upon request that pops nicely. The bread is good too, but the garlic bread, an extra not in the basic price, is the real deal. The steak is only made to order rare, medium and well done. My preference here is rare, given I usually order medium rare. Ask them to go easy with the salt if you are sodium sensitive and I would not recommend a temperature over medium at any place anyway, but particularly here. Beware of the peppercorn sauce, for it can be occasionally too salty for my tastes depending on the day. The fries are excellent and, if you have a thing for fries, the all you can eat fries will fix that. They have good desserts, but I rarely experience them. The waiters will ask the ladies if they would like dessert, not the guy. The service is quite good and I never have a complaint. The atmosphere reminds me of ski lodges and is quite welcome. For value (where in Midtown are you going to find this?), service and atmosphere, you will return again and again as I do.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/skirt-steak-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I went right when they opened and there was already a line forming, though I was seated right away. Definitely arrive between 5-6 before it gets super busy. They only specialize in one thing - steak frites for $30. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. Steak came out hot, tender and juicy. I got the medium which was cooked well, just a little bit underdone in a few small areas. Fries were thin and crispy - maybe a little too crispy and not salted enough (McDonald's fries are better IMO) but still delicious, and they're unlimited. The bernaise sauce was delicious on the steak and the fries, I didn't need anything more. Got the blackberry spritz which was delicious.

I'll say that a 10oz or so steak (can only be prepared rare, medium, or we'll done-- nothing in the middle),  a bitter salad that no one in my family but me could eat and fries that are mainly cold and overcooked is not worth 30 bucks.

Chrissy S.,/user_details?userid=2tGL1SDJnK7GiH8c5yhSBQ,"New York, NY",4/16/2022,4.0,"This is such a big hype on tictok and insta that my friend and I decided check it out. Since they don't do reservations for people under 7 or more, you do have to get there early if you want to try this spot. My friend got there at 6pm and we didn't get a table until 7:30 on a Friday.... Yeah that was a little crazy. Once you in, you have a simple menu and there are a few upgrades for extra charge. We started with the garlic bread with cheese which was an extra charge... but it was delicious. Salad was okay... I personally didn't like the fact it was large pieces of iceberg lettuce but the dressing was pretty good. For the mains, the French fries were good but could have been a little more crunchy, and the steak (which I asked well done) was a little burnt and the pieces were inconsistent. Dessert was amazing! They went around with a dessert cart where you and pick out whatever you want for an additional 10 bucks. I got the pastry with the hazelnut spread ... it was delicious and very satisfying. Would I come back? Maybe.... But definitely during Monday-Thursday and hope the wait isn't that long",https://www.yelp.com/biz/skirt-steak-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The steak and fries is amazing!!! The sauce is delicious and the quality of the food overall is amazing, especially for $28 per head. The meat is cooked perfectly (i got medium and it was actually medium, not over done). The service is friendly, relatively quick (especially considering they were understaffed when i was there). I will say the drinks are overpriced for what they are along with the dessert. The quality of the sides & desserts isn't on par with the quality of the mains. One thing that i really don't like is that the desserts go around on a cart. The cart is clunky, it's very impractical that they push it around the whole restaurant, and it's also unsanitary because the entire pie/cake is exposed at each table it goes to. Overall though, super impressed with this place and I'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/skirt-steak-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We decided to eat the wrong cake because we didn't feel like waiting for them to come back to order the right one. Finally we were able to tell them it was the wrong one and they gave us the one we originally ordered. The manager took the half eaten wrong cake from under us while we were eating and said ""you're not paying for it so I'm taking it""... and they were the ones that messed up the order!

Even though I asked him for a thing or two & he forgot about us lol however he was very nice & attentive to us throughout our visit. In fact the whole entire staff was very very nice! The hype of this restaurant is you get a skirt steak cooked to your liking, starting off with a salad & unlimited French fries for only $28. Everything you order outside of that is $10. My guest & I were very pleased with the flavor of the steak!!! This place does not take any reservations unless you have a party of 7+ people. When you arrive, there is a massive long line outside but the line was moving relatively fast. We did wait 45 minutes to go inside but it was worth the wait. Luckily for us it wasn't that cold out last night :) our waiter Diego did explain that us that you could order the steak either medium or well done. (No I'm between!) so we ordered medium. Little on the chewy side but the sauce that came with it was beyond delicious . Jalapeño mash was really good! Not at all spicy but definitely had the jalapeño taste/flavor (hint taste) Only thing I wasn't too happy about were the French fries. They weren't fresh off the fryer :( & we got a lot of little burned ones. Really wish that wasn't the case. Overall we had a great time , the person serving the desert was a gem also!

They brought us the salad to start which were chunks of uncut lettuce drenched in a lemon vinaigrette dressing. The steak amount was small for two and came VERY charred/ burned. Almost unable to eat. The unlimited fries were EXTREMELY salted and not fresh. Our dining experience was rushed and lasted maybe 30 minutes. This place is not worth waiting for to be rushed out. In addition, we ordered desert and it tasted as if it were out all day. A disappointing experience.

The cauliflower steak was a large portion, excellently cooked with a bearnaise sauce, mushrooms, watercress, and seasoned well to bring all the flavors together (you can ask to have it without the bearnaise if you are vegan). This comes with bread, a green salad that had a delightful dressing, as well as bottomless shoestring fries. The servers come around with fresh fries all the time and you can have as much as you want. All of this for $28. Sides, drinks, and desserts are extra.

Two, the salad was super bitter like pretty much inedible. My friend and I got sprite as our beverage and we were charged $10 for both even though it came in a small glass with lots of ice. The charged as $9 for the garlic bread which was tiny, we actually thought it was free because the server said that it came with the water. The steak itself was very char with no flavor. Tasted like plain cow meat tbh which I hated because I don't want my meat to taste and smell like the actual animal it came from.

Next we got a beet salad with lamb meatballs. The meatballs were so good, especially when eaten in tandem with the dips and bread. There was a drink pairing that was optional with each course and boy am I glad we did that! I was feeling it in the best possible way by the end of the dinner and I loved that the waiter was able to explain each course and drink pairing and how the flavors match.

Tanya D.,/user_details?userid=_HOwzo1k46HBogCUgED8XQ,"Brooklyn, NY",11/6/2019,4.0,"Everyone should eat here at least once. It's super weird and kitschy and has a cool history. The decor is fabulous, and it feels spacious in there. Service is good, but they do kind of rush you without trying to seem like it. I especially enjoyed the random people in red vests solomnley bringing dishes to our table without saying a word and then scurrying off. It's unique. But here's the thing - the food is just not that shit hot. I feel like if there were an iron chef competition between me and the Turks Inn chef using the same ingredients, I might win. The haloumi cheddar bites were good, but the breading tasted slightly off and for fried cheese at a cheaper price point I'd be okay with Arby's. The steak was seasoned with a paprika rub that just kind of distracted from it and made it less 'steaky'. It also needed salt, which they do not put on the table. The pork chop was tasty, but for 28.00 I could easily make a better one at home ( well, I mean, mine would cost maybe 8.00, tops) the crispy potatoes were okay, but just kind of weird - more like breakfast potatoes with some skins thrown in. If I made those for guests I'd be like ""sorry I fucked up the potatoes, guys..."" even though they were okay. In fact everything was fair to middlin', it's just that if you stripped away the cool ambiance and vibe of the interior decor and decent service, were sitting in just a blank white room, and got a check for two people with tip and tax that was just short of $200.00, you might feel somewhat... assaulted. (whereas there are some foods I could sit in a blank room eating and die of happiness - (I'm looking at you Izzies cheesesteaks!))  The cocktails were fantastic though. I got the smurfs blood or whatever it was called, and it was sheer delight crushing that strawberry caviar in my mouth. And  a great negroni. The place has some magical qualities for sure. If there were a lower budget version I'd go there all the time. Just realize you aren't going for the food really. I should have checked out the Sultan Room, maybe that is where it all comes together. It looked cool. But if friends from out of town are visiting, they'd dig this if you want to spend a lot of money. Also, good place for sharing small dishes beings as everything is ala carte. It also took all the willpower I had not to steal the cool little plate  my napkin was resting on when we first came in.

Incredible bartender/server--Michelin star service (forget his name but had glasses and tattoos but maybe that's not very helpful, went on a Monday...). Amazing atmosphere and the food was both considerate of the time period the restaurant came from (1950s Supper club) while being more sophisticated and contemporary. Only disappointment was the bar upstairs--not a great wine selection (had a chilled red after tasting two other wines that weren't so hot, but then again I have high wine expectations) and just let everyone else have it because I couldn't drink it. My boyfriend's on-draft negroni was supposed to be ""really good"" and tasted like bubble gum :(. Disappointed because the bartender on Monday was so professional, gave great recommendations and felt like I found a restaurant in bushwick that wasn't just trying to be a tourist/hipster park.

All in all, I was impressed by the quantity & quality of the options. While there is only 1 veggie patty (which is 75 cents more than regular, which struck me as peculiar), the options for toppings were plentiful and all sounded fun! I opted for the Philly, which was cheese, mushrooms, peppers, and onions. They certainly did not skimp on patty size and toppings, as they were spilling out of my burger. The fries are a bit expensive on the side of an already $10 burger alone, but if there was some spicy mayo on the burger, it would have been even better. Overall, quite a tasty option & made very quickly.

It is a great place to get dinner when you do not feel like cooking or going out to a traditional restaurant. The only couple of issues I have are with the price and the shake. Perhaps I should have gotten the combo meal, but instead, I got a classic Black Burger with Cheese, pickles, ketchup, and mustard. Along with a side of fries and a chocolate shake. In total, the meal was almost $20 including tip, which seems a little bit ridiculous for a burger joint. The shake was also a bit icy, and I could tell it had not been mixed all the way, but it was not a big deal and still tasted delicious! The burger itself was great, cooked really nicely, and seasoned well, the bun also served as a delicious addition to the meat. The fries weren't bad either! Seasoned, and great when paired with some ketchup. Overall, I do plan to go back, but I wouldn't go so far as to say this is the best burger joint in NYC.

Dan K.,/user_details?userid=bOWIB-b-UlRr9CweTxOxAQ,"Albertson, NY",7/26/2016,3.0,"I really wanted to like this place. But the reality fell short. Unlike the other hamburger close by with a name that also starts with ""black"", this place aims for the affordable, high volume output. The main problem I had with this burger was that they claim they're never frozen, but that's what the burger patty tasted like.  It was dense and not cumbly.  So kind of more like a fastfood burger.  The color was more grayish than anything.  And it hardly had any taste in my opinion.  There was nothing special about the bun either.  Overall, it reminded me almost of my elementary school lunch burger.  Not a pleasant memory.  Their fries (curly, seasoned) were good and there was a good amount.  I'm always pulling for the small, underdog places that put out solid, affordable food so I'll try this place again to see maybe if it were just an off day.  Note the place is really small (e.g., ~5 stools) and so much more suitable for takeaway (especially in the summer since it's all open air with no AC).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/black-burger-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Fries & Strawberry Shake.  Your order comes packaged in small little neat box, in which they suggest you use as A plate, by folding diwn the sides. The shake was THICK & Tasty, fries very good and plentiful. The burger while Very G00D was on the small side. Speaking of small, the spot is very SMALL & seating is very cramped and limited.

I ordered a double bacon cheese burger medium with all the trimmings and an order of onion rings. As spaces opened up I decided to have it there, the eating spaces were filthy, stains everywhere on the table, plates everywhere the floor was littered with napkins and straws, I took another look at the workspace and saw that it was filthy as well along with the grill and the floor by the grill was despicable. I ignored it because I spent over 1$ and decided to not waste food. The burger looked as if it was thrown into the box and the onion rings were overly well done / burnt. The meat which was supposed to be medium was way over well done (no pink at all) it was beyond sloppy because it was drenched in sauce, I would've moved past it but as I sat in the corner By the soda machine I heard squeaking, very loud squeaking.

This is a fast food place where you can specify temperature and your requests will be more what to leave off than what goes on. Grilled onions free, .50 extra to make any burger a turkey or veggie, they even have a lamb feta burger. Simple menu -burgers, shakes, grilled cheese and fries- even a burger salad - looks like there were wings, but definitely this is a burger place. Immaculate, a few counter seats.
