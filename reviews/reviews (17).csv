I opted for the bird's nest since the bartender said it tastes the least like alcohol compared to everything else on the whole menu lol. It was pretty good and very sweet, not one of the best drinks I've had but in general I liked how creative the drink menu was! Especially as a Chinese American recognizing a bunch of cultural references in the drink names, and the unique Chinese ingredients that are mixed into the drinks. In terms of food, I liked the truffle mushroom salad the most bc the flavors were on point. Pork belly was okay to me, I felt like the portions were way too small and could have been more tender. Crab fried rice was solid though!"

The tuna tostada app is full of flavor with a surprise of toasted sesame and each is the size of your palm - many bites. Next up was the aguachiles - which is a form of ceviche (raw fish in broth?).

Because I was alone, I made a reservation for the more casual tavern area, and opted out of the area offering the tasting menu. The cocktail list is straightforward and approachable. Being an Indiana native, I was pleased to see the only non NY beer offered was Three Floyds Gumballhead, which is a classic hoppy IPA. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. It makes you feel welcome while still being elevated. Service was great, as I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Not being super hungry, I went staight for an entree and chose the Grilled Black Bass over parsnips and a smoked oyster chowder. The first bite was pure bliss. Flavors expertly balanced and it had just the right touch of salt. I do wish the skin on the fish was slightly more crisp, but it didn't take away from the overall dish.

Although fairly limited, the selection is well executed which is apparent in flavors. We had the celery root purée soup and pasta with roasted butternut squash and lobster to start. Pasta was excellent with just the right al dente toothsomeness.  Next came mains roast chicken and vegg as well as skate wing over broccolini. Both were tasty although chicken skin could have been crispier. The skate wing was exceptionally well prepared. Lastly, we had chocolate mousse and cheesecake to finish . Again, well executed and with flavorful detail touches.  Staff was attentive and attentive to small requests like bar potato chips with drinks. We opted for Bloody Mary and soft drinks to the $144 base. Total tab with tax and tip was $243.  Albeit a bit pricey for lunch, as an early dinner which this was, this NY classic is well worth a visit .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gramercy-tavern-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Robert B.,/user_details?userid=cU-Z8K3TNM019C-62GtwIw,"New Orleans, LA",11/23/2022,5.0,I have always wanted to eat here. Several years ago I stopped by for a glass of wine but could not get a table. This time I made reservations 30 days in advance which is the earliest you can make them. All I can say is I was not disappointing at all. The ambience of the place itself is spectacular. It looks feels and smells like an English tavern. The wood fire on a cold day is very comforting. My wife and I both loved what we ordered as well. My wife ordered the steak tartare and I ordered the grilled pork shoulder. Both were fantastic. We also split the potato and clam flatbread. It was delicious as well. All in all I was very happy I went to the trouble of marking my calendar for 30 days ahead of when I was visiting New York so I could make reservations. I totally recommend this place. The service also is extremely warm and friendly.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/gramercy-tavern-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The inside was beautiful, walls filled with art. The staff was inviting and efficient in their pace of service. I tried a torpedo cocktail and had the duck meatloaf togo. I was worried, strictly by the appearance of my entree, that it wouldn't be as tasty as I surprisingly found it to be. The meatloaf was extremely savory and not gamey at all, you wouldn't know it was duck unless someone told you. The flavors resembled a salisbury steak, oddly, which I truly enjoyed. Especially the grilled char marks, they brought everything together.

It is highly unusual for him to leave a dessert unfinished.  I would say my favorite part of the meal was our wonderful server.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gramercy-tavern-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Service is top notch. Drinks are excellent- I tried a seasonal cocktail, spicy margarita, non alcoholic sparkling pear drink and tea. My review is 4 stars because I thought the food was very good but not excellent. There wasn't anything wrong with it but it just didn't wow me. We had to start flatbread and seafood sampler. Then to follow cheeseburger and brick chicken. For dessert chocolate pudding cake and the sticky toffee pudding. We also opted for a special lobster with caviar tart- this was my favorite thing we ate. Everything was very good but not wowing.

Kimberly V.,/user_details?userid=1sGYXSkJHPhJ6wQtc-RbZw,"North Scottsdale, Scottsdale, AZ",4/6/2022,4.0,"Gramercy Tavern is a true gem in NYC. When we knew we were finally going to be able to go to New York for a post poned birthday celebration from last year, I made a reservation for this Michelin starred restaurant. Gramercy Tavern is divided into two areas for dining: The Tavern and the dining room. As you may imagine, The Tavern is a little less stuffy, but it's still refined. You won't find flip flopped /tank top wearing people sauntering in. Initially I had a reservation for 530p on RESY and was on a waitlist to dine at 700p. The host on the phone was very accommodating in that. We arrived about 10 minutes early for our reservation. Gramercy Tavern hosts make sure that you are taken care of, but not before checking your vaccination status alongside your ID. After that, your coat is checked and you are offered a water while you wait for your table. We were reserved in the Tavern , as I didn't want to have price fixed menu that I had seen as the only thing available in the dining room. Our host told us at 715p that the occupants at our table had not left and we could dine in the dining room on the ala carte menu, as well, if we wanted. We wanted to wait. At 745p we were finally seated. Yes, it was a bit annoying for such a stuffy restaurant as we could see empty tables that never had occupants at them, BUT we also didn't know if this had to do with a Covid rule or something, despite the fact that we are in March 2022. The hostess bought us our first round of drinks and that was kind of her, although she could have saved the quip about it being my husband's birthday as she checked his ID.. (it was last SEPT that I booked this NYC getaway for us as his Broadway bday gift and due to the pandemic it postponed repeatedly) ..so yes, it actually WAS a birthday celebration. Our waiter was amazing. He apologized for the delay in seating profusely. He brought me another champagne and who could be angry when in a Michelin starred restaurant in NYC? The ambience here is beyond charming; it's pretty and rustic but also very up tick. My husband ordered the best burger he's tasted and at $32 it better be :) I had the Duck Meatloaf and again it was amazing!  Our server never missed a beat despite our rough 45 minute late start to the night. The menu here is great.. IF you're wondering how and why in a Michelin starred place my husband would order a burger.. well,, because, why would you not try a Michelin starred burger and duck fat fries!? I'll be the one to go out and order a Duck Meatloaf because well, IT""s different! The waiter brought my husband a Vanilla Coconut Cupcake and candle (even tho we told him of the delayed bday trip!) and it was one of those cup cakes you don't forget. We tried to order something more to split but I have a myriad of allergies to nuts and apparently pea and nut flours are used in most of the desserts. That is perfectly okay for me .. maybe not for someone else wanting that full on experience! BUT for us this was amazing ! If you get the chance, make the reservation and get to Gramercy ... it's a legend in New York City and there's a reason why .. It's nearly perfect !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gramercy-tavern-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Gramercy Tavern has been our favorite NYC restaurant and we made a point to come back once a year even living across the continent. This time it was disappointing! We ate dinner in the dining room as per usual. Portion sizes were smaller and the service was ok. The artic char used to come plated beautifully on a regular size plate, this time it was on a teacup size plate. The steak was a teeny tiny piece and slightly chewy. The cheesecake was a circle maybe 1.5-2 inches across. Our waiter- nothing wrong persay but it was not the Gramercy Tavern I had known and remembered. I think it was just him.

Everything on the 5 course tasting menu was delicious beyond words - the flavor combinations, the diversity of each course, and the servers were so attentive and asked a bunch of questions to make sure each course would come out to our liking. The complimentary bread was also fantastic and I agreed to a second serving of them so fast even as we were getting full from the rest of the meal. It's so hard to pick a favorite but it might be the asparagus risotto (and this is coming from someone who doesn't even really like asparagus usually!). The strawberries and cream was also so good I cleaned my plate entirely even though I was stuffed at that point. The different flavors and the difference of texture brought from the ice and the almost crouton-like cake crumble was really the icing on the cake. We'd also mentioned it was our friend's birthday a day ago at the start of the meal and had forgotten that we had until they brought out a little coconut cake at the end that was equally as lovely as the rest of the meal.

Reservations were fairly difficult to get; we were refreshing the reservations page minutes before the reservations for our desired day became available, and in less than a minute almost all the time slots were taken. The tavern part of the restaurant is more laid back with an a la carte menu similar to what you'd see in any American style restaurant in Manhattan. The quality of the ingredients was definitely there, but price-wise I'd say it's a little overpriced for what it is; $40 for a hamburger after tax is pretty steep even for New York. Tables were pretty squished together as well. The entire night we were somewhat forced to listen in to a conversation between two men in the finance industry about their investment strategies...not exactly what we wanted for a weekend dinner.

Darin E.,/user_details?userid=SRz0Q-tsPd1SU8bvFi_ToA,"San Francisco, CA",7/24/2022,5.0,"It had been a hot minute since I had a meal in the Tavern. The last few visits were with guests and we splurged for the dining room. This time around I had a plan. Get there early (I'm old and go to sleep early now so it's easy), cozy up to the bar and go big with the Tavern menu. My hope was their ability to put together a solid dining room menu would translate to a simpler more pared down menu in the Tavern. It was a really good decision. Instead of getting mains we stuck to cocktails and did an appetizers flight.  It was hot out and we didn't want to be weighed down by a heavy meal. We got oysters, salad, corn cake bread, steak tartare, and dessert (+port).  For our appetite level, the choices we made were absolutely perfect to split. The oysters and cocktails were commendable. The ambiance there is world class and the service attentive but not obnoxious.Everything else had incredible polish and freshness (stone fruit/tomato salad) and chocolate cake. There's a reason why this place is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC and they demonstrate it every single time I come here without fail. It's rather remarkable in that way. Special shout out to the tavern burger I didn't get. My neighbor at the bar ordered it and it looks absolutely awesome.

Ting Z.,/user_details?userid=n2flxj261ZXQFnt8wy8koQ,"Brooklyn, NY",7/2/2021,5.0,"(The Tavern): Definitely a Michelin-star worthy meal. Staff are all super professional and decor is both classy and welcoming. Presentation for all the dishes was beautiful. Started off with the chilled carrot soup, which had a really unique blend of flavors. It was a bit of an acquired taste for me; I don't regret ordering it but it probably isn't something I'd order again. For my main course I had the tilefish and I have to mention the seasoning here because the flavor was phenomenal. Finished off my meal with a cappuccino and the passion fruit soufflé. Cappuccino was wonderful, had that rich smoothness that comes with really good espresso, and I didn't feel the need to add any sugar at all. The passion fruit soufflé was probably my favorite part of the meal. Honestly the best soufflé I've had in my life-- super airy, delicate, and it just dissolved in your mouth. Paired very well with the roasted pineapple too. Portion sizes were such that I left feeling very comfortably full after 3 courses.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gramercy-tavern-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Caroline G.,/user_details?userid=1vxa7VAJOnI7Lhofum3nrg,"Jersey City, NJ",1/7/2022,5.0,"OK, Gramercy Tavern has been my favorite restaurant in NYC, since the first time I visited the place in 2002. That's 20 YEARS folks. Quite the run for someone who has lived in NYC now for 14 years. It's the food and the impeccable service which continuously keep me coming back combined with the fact that while this establishment is fine dining, they aren't stuffy and keep it authentic and natural. My last visit was 1/1 for a tasting menu with wine pairing in the dining room. Like I said, I have been there many times but apparently never left a review. My favorite dish was the lobster lumache with rock Shrimp, cubanelle peppers, tarragon. Revelatory! My least favorite was the smoked arctic char but to be fair, I don't generally like smoked fish. Also, whoever is doing the chocolate piping in the back for the birthday dessert has some work to do; Happy Birthday was a mess. You can't come at a baker with that, friend. We had two separate waitresses who were both stellar, though I have sadly forgotten their names.

They brought out bread which is very unlike NYC restaurants these days and I always appreciate that (especially when you pay these prices...). We both got the burger. They said it would take 20 minutes to come out but it really only took less than 10. They don't ask what temperature you want it at. It comes out at a medium rare which I don't like that much. It's comes with bacon, cheese and lettuce on it. The side is chips which in my opinion is very disappointing. I want fries! Anyway. The burger was alright. Nothing to rave about.

Talia K.,/user_details?userid=Z78m2lbO0OY9ZK81k4Zdlg,"New Hyde Park, NY",9/20/2020,4.0,"My parents and I came here for dinner on my birthday. We were seated at one of their tables in the street and the lights and flowers set up were very nice. When we sat, my dad noticed his fork was dirty so we had to get a new one. We ordered three appetizers to share-the tomato carpaccio, the salad, and the chicken liver mousse. The carpaccio was very good, the dressing on it worked very well with the flavors. I also enjoyed the liver a lot, it was not too salty. For dinner, my mom and I shared the Campanelle Bolegnese and the pepper chicken and they were both great. The chicken was just a bit tough and under seasoned in my opinion but the flavors that came across were still very good and it was enjoyable. The pasta was probably my favorite, the sauce was not too heavy and I enjoyed it a lot. For dessert we got the gelato and the chocolate chunk cookie. The cookie was ok, nothing special so I would definitely recommend the gelato instead if you have to pick one.

Harika K.,/user_details?userid=wysvw_MvlV9R0RTRyYBOEA,"CA, CA",4/13/2021,5.0,"Made reservations for Gramercy a few days in advance for a weekday dinner. It was a great experience! We were running late and also had dietary restrictions and the hosts were super accommodating and understanding. The ambiance is great (a little dark inside but it's fine). I got the only veggie entree option, the grilled eggplant parmigiana, and it was (a) very tasty and (b) a massive portion. It comes in a HOT cast iron skillet. There are layers of grilled eggplant, a delicious tomato sauce, and cheese. The cheese is bubbling on the sides when it arrives and the bits on the side got all crispy and burnt...so good! The tomato sauce was rich, flavorful, and very unique! I feel like a lot of marinara sauces, especially for eggplant parm ALWAYS taste the same and this one was certainly unique in a good way. It almost had some Indian flavors to it (perhaps the spices?). Eggplant was also well cooked and flavored! We also got the cheesecake for dessert. I really enjoyed the cheesecake, it has a great crust and was the perfect level of sweetness. Did NOT enjoy the sorbet at all though, had a funky citrus taste almost like fake candy citrus vibes. My friends really loved it so it was probably just a personal preference.

Eliana W.,/user_details?userid=k_RVNcle2qUwfgrxH-YO9g,"NoHo, Manhattan, NY",9/5/2020,5.0,Gramercy Tavern is definitely my favorite restaurant in the city. I've been to the formal dining room a few times and always walk away loving pretty much everything I ordered. The complementary bread rolls are amazing and they are happy to give you extra rolls. This was my first time eating the tavern food and it was also outdoor dining for COVID. I ordered the cheeseburger which was one of the best burgers I've had. The chilled corn soup was so fresh and seasonal as was the peach daiquiri which given how much I love peaches is probably one of the best drinks I've had at a restaurant. The peaches tasted like they were just picked. I hope they do outdoor dining again next year because the street was closed off from cars and it was really quiet and pretty.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/gramercy-tavern-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Why make it so hard for people to book ? or do you only get a booking if you know someone at this place ? . The reservationist also sounded like she drank the cool aid.

Both of us agree on giving them 5 stars for service, food and ambiance. Everything we had was delicious and perfectly executed. They start you with a free focaccia bread that has cheese, thyme and peach on it which was savory. We got the roasted oysters, sea bass, duck sausage, sides of braised greens and squash. For desserts, we got the peach cobbler and pumpkin beignets which size is good for 2 people. I'm glad it's not your typical american meal. It has it's uniqueness and all the ingredients tasted fresh.

I've always had my SO take me here even as much as once a month to celebrate as we live in the area. This year my sister treated me to a birthday lunch so it was the first time I saw the receipt (she left it on her counter by mistake) and I was appalled that they don't give free refills on a $5.50 Diet Coke. I am fine paying $40 for a great burger and and overall fine paying $140 for a great lunch but DO NOT NICKLE AND DIME ME!! A $5.50 Diet Coke should come with refills I don't care what type of restaurant it is.

Food was decent, however I was expecting to be blown away so I left somewhat disappointed. The best dish of the night was the chilled cucumber soup (not pictured). It was super light and refreshing yet still slightly creamy. It was the perfect summertime soup, extremely mellow and cool. For our entrees we ordered the bolognese and cioppino. The bolognese was very good (4/5). It was very meaty and satisfying and the pasta was cooked perfectly. However, the cioppino was disappointing. For a $39 dish, the portion was extremely small. I'm used to small portions in fine dining restaurants but this was slightly absurd. It came with one scallop, one shrimp, a few pieces of squid and some lackluster vegetables. Furthermore, When I order a cioppino, I'm expecting a very impressive and flavorful broth. This broth was quite bland and had none of the umami I'm used to. The wine and cocktails we ordered were very good and the service was exceptional. However, the cioppino really put a damper on dinner.

Sadly, it was a giant miss. My son had the double broth and dumpling soup. The broth was decent but there were only four teeny tiny dumplings. For an appetizer, I had the asparagus and scallion pancake. It was very ""herby"". It was like the chef had put scallion cream cheese on top of a pancake and then topped it all with sliced asparagus. After the apps, I thought, this has to get better. It did not. For our main meals, my son got the lamb Tripoline (this was a pasta dish). He was so disappointed. It was not tasty at all and had a slightly burnt flavor. For my main dish, I got the eggplant. It was AWFUL. Mushy. The flavor was so smoky that there was nothing else to taste. Sigh. Did I mention that the meal was super expensive, too? We each at three or four bites of our main dishes and gave up.

I hadn't been here since pre-covid and frankly, I was disappointed. They used to have a wide selection of breads that you could choose from, but now they just give a cold, not so tasty brioche.  Shrimp toast was a tiny portion for $18. Entrees were oversalted. We had the hanger steak, the duck pasta, and the tilefish. Tilefish was probably the best of the three. And dessert was $16 for a chocolate pudding cake that was literally three spoonfuls...I was quite shocked by the portion size.

Sara S.,/user_details?userid=NU9CeNv1hOagMuwPXp66Vw,"Pittsburgh, PA",1/31/2019,5.0,"Incredible experience at Gramercy Tarvern! We went for my parents' anniversary and they greeted us with a glass of champagne to celebrate. We decided to have the seasonal tasting menu with wine pairing and every dish tasted great. My mother was hesitant about the tasting menu as she did not want a duck dish, but they were extremely accommodating and let her choose another dish to replace that with. The complexity of flavors, textures and presentation and the impeccable service is why I give Gramercy 5+ stars. In addition, the culinary team presents surprise dishes throughout the meal-- we received a parsnip puree, apple sorbet, homemade chocolate/gummies and a to-go granola bar. These surprises go above and beyond and that is what you are paying for.

This is, hands down, one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. It's a beautifully decorated place, and it reminded a lot of restaurants in London. There are two sections: one that is more affordable and all the way to the back is the other more fancy section. We did the pre-fixed menu in the latter (I ordered the sampler).  It's quite pricey - I think our dinner was almost $400.00, including tips.

Calamari Flat bread was just ok. And among the main courses, I would say that the Sunchoke Ravioli beats the Lamb T bone and the Monkfish. The intervals of wait from sitting you, to taking the orders and serving appetizers to the main course, were so long to their own detriment since there were parties of three, or two that could have been seated if food came in faster than half an hour. Service was very polite and even friendly. Wait staff is very well trained. The ambience is worth coming for though.

The ""lobster"" was served as three mini--I kid you not--dime-sized medallions, though in a reasonably tasty sauce.

I have never felt so guilty about spending $180+ dollars on food for ONE person before. I don't mind spending a lot of money on food when it's good, but this was extremely disappointing! The place was really nice & the mood was set nice. We were seated and got water brought to us & then we waited for what felt like forever to get our server. Finally we got drinks & I had the MOST awful drink off of their menu. I don't know why anyone would create such a drink. After one sip I told the server I hated it & asked if I could exchange it for a different drink. He looked at me kind of weird and said sure. He brought me my different drink which tasted SO off but was drinkable. Their homemade bread was very very good ! That was the best part sadly. The 3 courses were absolutely awful. One of the dishes I had was pasta with ground beef & honestly hamburger helper tastes better ! Such a lack of flavor ! My main course the meat was so tough & chewy I couldn't even get it down ! Their baklava IS NOT BAKLAVA ! Not one thing about it resembles a baklava !!! That wasn't even a fancy version of it , it straight up was something else and they put the name on it. Whoever added that to the menu has never seen a baklava in their life ! I don't know how this place had anything more than 1 star and how people actually like this food. I think it's so ""high end"" that people just agree to say it's good. This place is terrible please DO NOT waste your money on it !!!!

It was worth all the hype and more. The burger was incredibly juicy and cooked perfectly. The bun looked like it would be really dry but it had just the right amount of squeeze and moisture. The sauce they serve with the burger stole the show. It had a great acidity and savoriness to it which paired great with the fatty burger. In previous reviews people said the burger was huge and to share which I did with my husband but it wasn't too large at all and we probably could have each had one easily. The ginger swizzle mocktail was divine!

While the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived, it quickly filled up. When paying the check, we were pleasantly surprised with a few bonbons as a parting treat.

It opens at noon for lunch, and we were able to get a spot at the bar because we were in line outside at 11:45. We did not need a reservation to sit at the bar, however I believe one would have been necessary to have lunch in the restaurant. My boyfriend pointed out to me that this is one of the few restaurants in the country that has earned a Michelin star. I had a pumpkin soup and it was incredible! I had mint hot tea that was completely prepared behind the bar and all I had to do is pour it into my cup. My boyfriend had an incredible, grass fed beef burger which was prepared perfectly. He was even offered simple syrup as well as other accoutrements to go with his iced tea.

Zachary A.,/user_details?userid=JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Austin, TX",9/6/2019,5.0,"Gramercy is truly an institution that lives up to all hype.  Tavern takes reservations but also has about 20 seats at the bar which are first come and full menu.  Food isn't too expensive given the tip is included, so a $32 burger really sits at about $27 which isn't absurd given how good it is.  Cooked perfectly medium rare and a thick cut of bacon/ham and some of the best cheese I've ever had.  Had that french onion cheese feel that gave each bite a full texture.  Juices flow and the bun was so pillowy that you could peel it layer by layer.  Sesame seed of course is way to go and meat itself was great quality.  I asked for a different side to chips and I got some pickled veggies which are on the bar menu, but I think compliment the burger well with a little sourness to the burgers savory.  Cocktails are fire and really can't go wrong with anything.  Their rendition will be one of the best of whatever you order.  I personally had a house manhattan, up, that apparently used to be on the house menu, and I know why because it was boozy, no sugar, and easy to swallow.  Great drink and great food.  Servers are busy but keep you in mind. They remember your name from the onset and monitor you like a good waiter should.  Super polite and just friendly.  I would definitely recommend the bar to anyone trying to get a New York meal.  Could easily stay here for hours drinking and eating, and though it won't be cheap, will be better off here than trying to snag a $30 cocktail or $60 steak elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gramercy-tavern-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Amy S.,/user_details?userid=wGMAri6CNX5xVeMemRtoKA,"Manhattan, NY",8/30/2020,2.0,"Unfortunately, while every other restaurant in the city is bending over backwards to welcome diners and do whatever it takes, Gramercy Tavern, a long-time favorite for special events, doesn't know how to address Covid-era dining. They really want to still justify Michelin-starred prices, even if the menu only has three options, but forget any semblance of the service you once expected from this fine NY institution. We're all in this together (aka I'm thrilled to be eating in the street with sirens and garbage and panhandlers, sounds great! No problem!), and I can even ignore that I'm paying $30 for pasta or a $25 cheeseburger right next to four other restaurants that charge much less to eat a cheeseburger in the street... because THIS cheeseburger is a Gramercy Tavern cheeseburger and this service is going to make me feel like I still live in the city I used to love, right? I wish we'd just gone to L'Express--they are actually happy to have diners during covid. Now is really not the time to be rude to your customers. (You might think, 'oh this is a fallout from the Danny Meyers no tipping policy' but no, they are actually rude in spite of now working for tips again.) In short, they have no idea how to actually balance ""you're eating in the bike lane"" with ""but we're still Gramercy Tavern.""",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gramercy-tavern-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I had to deploy all my charm to book a table ;-) The neo-colonial decor is perfect, warm and welcoming; the service is attentive without being invasive. The food is close to divine: a wonderfully original beetroot, blackberries, hazelnuts and pancetta salad for starters, and a lamb loin cooked to perfection, accompanied by a fine merguez sausage, broccoli rabe and ricotta on grilled sourdough as the main course. The cheese platter did not disappoint. The wine list is good; my only small complaint is that it could be a little more extensive in the choices offered, but this is just me being pedantic!

No music in the dining room - may be a good thing depending on preference. Expansive drinks menu. Food's great.
