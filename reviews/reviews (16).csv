Nicholas G.,/user_details?userid=fExL6u06xTSg13k945IPAQ,"Hoboken, NJ",2/21/2023,4.0,Looks like they have a few locations so must have something about it. The shumai were my jam. The pork ribs also was solid but not my favorite. The cold carp fish dish wasn't my thing but I love to try authentic dishes. The reason you come here is the dumplings and the soup dumplings were delicious. The bread type pork dumplings were my favorite. I think they were pan-fried and lovely. This place is in the 4 star range and like I mentioned... come for the dumplings and enjoy!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered the Shanghai soup dumplings and the pan fried shanghai soup dumplings. I'm used to getting 6 or 8 in a portion so it was strange to me that it was only 4 for a portion. The pan fried soup dumplings were something I never tried before, so my group was excited to order it. The bottom was crispy, but the filling was unfortunately lukewarm at best and the dough was thicker than one would expect for Shanghai dumplings. The steamed soup dumplings were hot and flavorful, but again the dumpling exterior was more doughy and not the expected light and thin exterior so that threw me off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Yvette M.,/user_details?userid=6fx_GzF4Os4-hLmaYREvbw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3/20/2023,1.0,"Yesterday evening my husband and I decided to come here for dinner and drinks. We chose this place since we were in the area. We wanted to try a new restaurant that wasn't too busy. When we walked in, there were about 3 or 4 small groups dining. The other half of the restaurant was empty, and that's where we were asked to sit. One of the female employees immediately handed us our menus and served us water. The other female employee was taking table orders and chatting with customers. After about 5 minutes, we were ready to order. We waited and waited, and waited some more. We looked around, made eye contact with both employees, but no one ever came over. After a few minutes, the employee who had served us water approached our table only to refill our glasses and walk away. We decided to give the staff additional time so I went to the restroom in the meantime. When I came back, I learned that the server still had not come to our table. We had waited a total of 25 MINUTES before deciding to leave. In addition to service being is terrible, the restroom smelled very filthy. This lack of cleanliness was definitely the deal breaker. That's when we decided that we needed to leave. All of this was a definite sign that we were not meant to eat there. Having two customers wait that amount of time shows how inconsiderate and unfriendly the staff can be towards their customers. Don't come here. There are better places with better service in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Of course we ordered a few sets of the dumplings along with the Shanghai salted meat with vegetable rice and the dry-fried green beans with pork. We later ordered the crab soup dumplings just because we could! Each dish was delicious. Next time I plan to try the other signature dishes. I have a feeling you can't go wrong ordering from here and this is your chance to get a taste of cuisine from the Jiangnan region of China (the menu mentions several cities in the region including Shanghai and Wuxi). They offer other more well-known dishes like kung pao chicken and orange beef, which I'm sure are very tasty, but I think before I went for those I'd like to try the Wuxi Pork Ribs and the West Lake Fish.

Frank A.,/user_details?userid=9s7AurWtJa3iV_h-gN2QGQ,"Manhattan, NY",7/31/2019,3.0,"Tipsy Shanghai is the New York sibling of a restaurant in Shanghai that was started in 1905. So with that history you would expect amazing flavors and unique Shanghai dishes. Unfortunately, the food at Tipsy Shanghai can only be described as bland and some of their menu items are more American Chinese (shrimp with lobster sauce, sweet & sour chicken, etc) than truly Chinese. The restaurant itself is very nice and the service is good, but the food is simply bland. We were hoping for something special and left being disappointed.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However it was actually a disappointment. The noodles taste ok but we waited one and half hour for the delivery(which is also annoying), so as you can imagine, all noodles stick together and became a soggy pancake. The ribs and zongzi are both very disappointing. Sour taste. Feels like they are spoiled. Our favorite is the sweet sticky rice.

I'm so happy I found this restaurant, and will definitely visit it again the next time I'm con the area! The only unfortunate drawback is the minimal options for vegetarian and vegan diets. Nevertheless, our server was very helpful and the kitchen altered a couple of items into vegetarian dishes. The stir fry green beans are absolutely fantastic and spicy, with that ""kissed by the wok"" flavor essential to this dish.

But aside from an interesting retro decor, good service and having many authentic items, the food tasted very bland and lacked any serious flavor. Both the pan fried xiaolongbao and the shredded bean curds (tasted pre-frozen?) in chicken and shrimp broth didn't really hit home for me and were very unimpressive. The pork ribs were just okay because many of them are the tough, dry pieces of meat not attached to the rib bones. The presentation of each dish, however, made them slightly more appealing but the taste is very average for Shanghainese food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The signature dish, Wuxi pork ribs was good and the meat was so tender it fell off the bone, but the only downside was that it was not completely flavorful throughout the entire piece. The string beans were cooked to perfection just the way I like it. But the main star would definitely be the beef noodle soup.

The food and service was great. It's got a few dishes which aren't on the standard Shanghai restaurants that already exist. The soup dumplings are adequate but woefully overpriced. Their rent is probably a lot higher than the Chinatown Shanghai restos though. It's definitely worth a try!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/tipsy-shanghai-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The menu was a bit of a mess to navigate, but we found the dishes we wanted. We got soup dumplings, salted duck, pork rib soup with radish, bok choy with tofu skin and osmanthus flower with rice ball dessert. The price of the food is way more than I would normally pay at a restaurant in Chinatown, but the flavor and service at the restaurant made up for it. The soup dumplings were hot and juicy and had a hint of sweetness to the soup. The duck was clean and easy to eat, minimal mess with the bones. The rib soup was just like how mom makes it, so extra points there and the bok choy with tofu skin was fresh and clean too. Our waitresses were also on top of the water, warm lemon water, perfect for the cold day outside.

My friend and I found the restaurant on yelp and their menu seems to attract us to go try their food. We know that now they only do take out because of the lockdown but they also have some seat outside for customers to eat. We don't mind self service during this time but the fact that they didn't see that we gave them over 20% tips because I just put it in their tip box instead of giving them in front of their face. So when they thought they didn't get the tips they treated my friend kind of bad. She went inside asking for a trash and napkin and the cashier made unhappy face and answer my friend with an attitude. I wondering WILL THEY ONLY TREAT CUSTOMER depend on how much TIPS? Should they love what they do and treat everyone equally? Good tips come from good service so in this case we gave so much tips and got trashy service because they thought we didn't give them any tip.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/noods-n-chill-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Molly N.,/user_details?userid=N8mPh0d1cDtSYELxB24VJg,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5/29/2020,1.0,"I'd not want to write a bad review for any restaurants at the moment due to the fact that the pandemic is already damaging for most of them. But my latest experience prompted me to share it since diners should be treated better even during the tough time. My husband and I ordered from here 4 times and the food here tended to be too sweet although they weren't supposed to and their crab fried rice had little amount of crab and veggies. There aren't many good Thai choices where we live and so we ordered different things from them each time hoping the new items would be better but unfortunately they weren't. The last time we ordered from Seamless makes it the last time we will order from this place since they accused us of lying when we said there was no choice of proteins on the seamless app we used and so we had to make a note about the protein when ordering. Then the additional price was added to the order without informing us first and so I had to call them. Why would I waste my time calling them if I could see and select the protein choice properly myself? The overall food was ok (with my notes saying ""not sweet please""). Their pricing is on the expensive side but the quality isn't as high as the price. The green curry got no coconut milk flavors and was barely edible. The Isan sausage was the only item that was good. My husband had no complaints about his basil dish (also with a not sweet request).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/noods-n-chill-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I love the green beans in a bag as well. They are all low carb and prepared to absolute perfection. My tip is to always order in advance on the website. You can eat inside if you'd like to, after receiving your order. It is noisy and bustling because it's an excellent restaurant in the middle of a very popular tourist destination, but that's all to be expected.

Included on the side were 2 grilled green chili peppers. Lamb is often my go to order anywhere, I love the gamey taste and it comes through in this wrap. Tahini sauce pairs very well.

Claudia B.,/user_details?userid=p4UcEYTLJyh96o1R8wrJaQ,"Simi Valley, CA",1/22/2020,5.0,"On Christmas Eve day, we descended upon one of MY favorite places in NYC... Chelsea Market. Â I just love that place, and no matter how little time we have in the Big Apple, I always make sure we make a return trip to see what's new...... and something IS always new there. Â They are forever changing eateries and shops. Â One could NEVER get bored at this NY institution. Â So, speaking of new (at least to me from the last time I was here in 2016), we tried Miznon for a quick snack. Â It was lunchtime, but we had plans for a big dinner, so we thought we'd share a sandwich instead of us each ordering something. Â I'm glad that's what we did so as to not ruin our appetites for dinner, but I'm sorry we did that in the sense that what we ate was so good, I wanted more. Â Anyway, we got a FALAFEL BURGER (served on Tuesdays and Fridays ONLY), which included the falafel, tomato, pickles, sour cream, and green chili peppers, and it was divine. Â The falafel was fried just prior to placing in the warm pita, and the flavors melded together like a harmonious symphony. Â Between my husband and I, we gobbled it up in what felt like seconds. Â Again, I was just sorry we couldn't eat more. Â I guess we'll just have to return SOON to NY and to Miznon and eat more of their food next time.

The prices are very much decent - ranging from $8-$14. There is seating inside of the restaurant and in the Chelsea Market area. The only thing I really wish they had that would make it an ultimate Israeli experience is if they had hummus and babaganush. I was craving that as a side to my pita dish, but I was so full after my meal that maybe it was a good thing they didn't have anything extra for me to buy.

Matthew L.,/user_details?userid=pGeFO3FZW1Du-voFmgLEQQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/12/2019,2.0,"One of my favorite things about mushrooms is how much flavor can be packed into them. So what did I just pay $11.50 for? A remarkably pillowy pita? That's a start. A half filled sandwich? Can't be. Underseasoned mushrooms? Nope. A little sour cream and raw spring onion? You see where I'm gong here. I love the idea of serving every sandwich, even if its underwhelming, with a full fried hot pepper, but finding 3 grains of sea salt on it only left me wondering why that too had been so poorly seasoned. And, I guess it's cool to sit and eat a middling sandwich amongst a throng of cooks shouting at the top of their lungs, but it's cooler when the food makes it worth it. Had I not noticed the schug condiment sitting by the waiter station I wouldn't have known about my one option for adding a little more flavor to my sandwich. My waiter certainly didn't offer it up. Or a fork, for that matter. As a long-time New York eater I love when someone comes in with a new way to eat on a pita, even if it's not that new. But Miznon is just charging tourists $11.50 for a stand in for the real thing. For $11.50 in NYC I'm used to getting a drippy, crunchy, salty, spicy, pickly mess of a pita Â that fills me up for hours. I'd definitely try the world-famous cauliflower if it weren't called world-famous and look like the same cauliflower I've made at home by putting it in a hot oven, then taking it out.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/miznon-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You can really come here for any occasion; date, taking the parents out, GNO, etc. Service was impeccable; Khalil and Juan were great, we felt spoiled with attention. Now to the menu, everything we had was great. The breads are both amazing but then we were so full towards the end of the meal so I'd only choose one and then come back for the other one. My friends liked the 'Roni cups but I would've liked to save room in my tummy for other things. The Filetto was my favorite dish and worth the hype. Save room for dessert and at least get the Lemon Cheesecake, another worth it dish. The sorbetto was a great palate cleanser to close out the meal. And cocktails, trust your server and get any of the spritzes (also served in cute glasses) but the orange wine we had was pretty spectacular.

The space is beautiful. The vibe and playlist are just as awesome. The crowd looks to be appropriately upscale and trendy. But you don't come to Bad Roman for any of those great things, you come for the absolutely amazing and creative food. Everything we ate was delicious. The cocktails were wonderful as well.

We went with a group of four and ordered a crazy amount of food, with the musts for next time being the garlic babka, roni cups, the wedge, the rigatoni, and (surprisingly) the short rib pappardelle. The rock shrimp garganelli was excellent too, and the table was split on the gricia -- I thought it was a little more peppery than I'd typically want from this kind of dish, but my wife really loved it.

Seriously every other Instagram post and TikTok video is about Bad Roman! To start the ambiance - it is in the time Werner center which has so many other great restaurants as well. It is defiantly a different feel entering from a mall setting versus the street like many other restaurants in NYC, but it reminds me of restaurants in the big hotels in Vegas in that sense. The interior is STUNNING every last detail was thought of - from the women's bathroom to the hall to the wallpaper on the ceiling and I can't forget to mention the incredibly comfy chairs. We had an 8:30 res and weren't seated until 8:45 and our waiter never formally introduced himself so that was a little confusing but we went within the first two weeks of opening so I'll make an exception. Everyone was incredibly friendly and insightful when we asked about recommendations from the menu. They also apologized over and over for the wait. Now for the FOOD and DRINK. Cocktails looked unreal but we were in the mood for wine and the wine list was so impressive and extensive. For food we had the whipped ricotta with truffle honey and focaccia, the roni cups, the spicy caeser, the short rib pasta and the filet with cacio e pepe raviolo. It was GREAT! The roni cups while expensive for what they were were so delish and very unique. The filet with the raviolo stole the show for me, the steak was amazing and I loved the cacio with it. YUM YUM YUM.

They did an excellent job decorating this restaurant, while all of the quality branded restaurants are beautiful this one is really exceptionally done. The food was also incredible. The garlic babka is a must order. So so good no matter what else you are getting. We also order Hamachi crudo whenever it is on any menu, and this one still somehow exceeded expectations. The spicy Cesar was good, the same as you can get at quality bistro which in our opinion is a top salad in NYC. The lobster pasta was good, the highlight definitely being the lobster over the pasta. The pasta wasn't the best I've had but the lobster was cooked perfectly and thy crack it in a way that's easy to eat without the grandness of the presentation being reduced. We aren't usually dessert people but the chocolate tarte with olive oil gelato sounded too good to turn down, and I'm so glad we got it. It was almost like a thick pudding with the most strangely delicious olive oil creamy gelato. We would likely get all of this again, although would try a different pasta and entree next time.

Bailey A.,/user_details?userid=Q6qtLoTp3kL50wAyAeNthQ,"Tampa Bay, FL",12/17/2020,5.0,I love Sushi Gallery! This is honestly the best sushi I've ever had. We lived right next to sushi gallery for about 2 years and would get it at least once a week. They have a refrigerator outside the restaurant so you can grab and go on your way home (Not sure if this is still there during COVID). The menu has a lot of options. Everything I have tried there has been great. Their tea is wonderful and their soups are the best I've had as well. It takes a bit of time to get your food because it is just the husband and wife making it. They make everything right in front of you. They are extremely hard working. At first they come off as very straight forward and to the point but once you get to know them they are very friendly. We moved from Brooklyn right before COVID and we have not been able to find a sushi spot as great as sushi gallery. Every time we go back to the city we make a point to stop by here. When we last visited they remembered us and were so glad we came back. They were telling other guests how we used to live nearby and come eat all the time.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-gallery-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jessica H.,/user_details?userid=mP9QuZuLtuO0vi-9ZG8qfA,"Brooklyn, NY",6/7/2021,3.0,"I wanted to like this place, I really did. Â I'm local and would love to add another sushi restaurant to my ""go-to's"" so I convinced a friend to try Sushi Gallery with me for take-out. Â My major issue (my friend noticed it to) was that the sushi rice had a slight soapy taste to it. Â Yes, soap, as if maybe they didn't rinse the rice pot fully after they cleaned it. Â I ordered the sweet potato roll and was just expecting sweet potato but got a roll with avocado, sweet potato, and sauce, and the sweet potato had a grainy texture to it. Â The additional items on the sweet potato roll weren't bad, but given that it was in part for my kids, they made it inedible to them. Â I ordered directly from the restaurant and had a hard time finding a menu, but the one I found didn't provide a description other than ""sweet potato"" so I just wish it was more descriptive. Â The spicy crunchy tuna roll had what looked like balls of rice crispy cereal on top, and I'm used to the more shredded fried crisps. Â They also didn't include the small cups to put soy sauce in, and since I was eating my meal outside it made it more difficult than if I was home I would've had a dipping bowl. Â But I'm not a fan of plastic waste so I can't get too mad at them, but it was bad timing. Â The wasabi was melted and fully touching the rolls near it in the container, which again for me wasn't a big deal, but made it so that my kids they wouldn't eat those rolls. Â Also worth noting that they add 3.99% if you pay with credit card (the prices listed are if you pay in cash). Â They didn't have bulgogi (they said they only have sushi) but maybe that's a covid thing? Â Maybe I'll give them one more chance but based on my first visit, I'm not very hopeful unfortunately.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-gallery-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Vaughn G.,/user_details?userid=s0MnShvgR4i47Md33EnoXA,"Spotsylvania County, VA",2/24/2012,5.0,"Sushi Gallery is a very nice, cute spot located in the awesome Clark St station. Â As everyone else has stated, it has a sweet ""mom & pop"" vibe to it and the chefs/owners are very friendly and efficient with their work. Â I haven't dined in the place yet; I've only gotten takeout, but the sushi is always very fresh. Â I've been going here for a little over a year now and it seems to have gotten even better over time. Â The miso soup that you receive with your entrÃ©e is always hot and delicious. Â They always get your order right, and even if they're about to close at 11PM, they still happily answer the phone and take orders at or after 11, which is a rarity for Brooklyn Heights restaurants. Â Usually restaurants stop taking orders 15 to 30 minutes before their stated closing time, and most close at 10 sharp. Â I've had nothing but good experiences here and it will remain my convenient spot for those sushi cravings! Â Oh, and the prices here are remarkable for the quality and cuisine, especially as compared to Ozu across the street. Â It's also worth mentioning that Sushi Gallery is the only restaurant I've found in Brooklyn so far which has Korean items on its menu, and quite a few at that.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-gallery-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

And it's in Brooklyn Heights, where there seems to be an unwritten rule that Every Restaurant South of Cranberry Must Suck. This place doesn't. A long time resident of the Heights suggested I try it, and I was totally surprised. I've lived in the Heights for 8 years and would have sooner eaten an errant hot dog lying in a puddle of dog piss before getting sushi here. In fact, it's much better than Iron Chef, quieter, friendlier and comparably priced.

When I asked what seafood was in there he couldn't really specify, but assured me it was a ""bunch of different stuff."" After waiting like 20 minutes, I finally got home, starving and excited only to find that after paying like 16 bucks, the ""seafood"" in my soup consisted of 3 mini mussels and one piece of calamari. I called Sushi Gallery and they were clearly annoyed. The owner wasted alot of time telling me noone has complained before. When I brought it back for a refund (would have been equally happy just to get some seafood added, but that didn't seem to be an option), they continued haranguing me, saying that the soup doesn't come with alot of seafood..for 16 bucks???? really??

My favorite so far is the Mul-Naengmyeon though. I ordered this as part of the ""Galbi + Naengmyeon"" option on the menu but the galbi was disappointing. The meat seemed a bit dried out and hard to chew on. The Mul-Naengmyeon was 10/10 though. The broth was so good that I didn't have to add any vinegar, which people usually do to give it better flavor. Not sure whether the galbi is that bad for the main menu since it is one of their popular dishes.

Risa H.,/user_details?userid=PblwfR1C8oerFQjfI1Z0tw,"New York, NY",9/6/2022,2.0,"It's hard to find a Burmese restaurant in New York (why is that?), so when my friend suggested this spot I was down to try it! Â I frequent the popular Burma Superstar in San Francisco every time I go back home, and compared to that restaurant the Tea Leaf Salad ($16) was sub-par. Â It would have been nice if they mixed the salad at the table, and the actual tea leaf portion was small. Â The staff was nice - the place gives off a very hippie Brooklyn feel. Â After the Tea Lead Salad was served it seemed like we waited 35+ minutes for the next dish to come out. Â We ordered the Spicy Pork Shoulder Slaw ($17) that had probably 4 pieces of actual pork in there, Spicy Mee Shay Noodle ($18 + $4 for pork) - best dish we had in my opinion, Pork in Tea Leaf Curry ($26) and the Spicy Masala Beef ($25). Â We also ordered the Going Places IPA Beer from Hopewell Brewing Co. ($10 - why is this can expensive where I can buy it at the store for more than half price cheaper?) but got served a different brewery's beer. Â The heads up on the change of beer would've been nice! Â The two curries we had were a bit disappointing, especially for the price. Â The pork and ground beef were dry and tasteless. Â We expected more from the beef (also wasn't expecting it to be ground beef even though we saw later it said so on the menu) and the portion for it was so small for the price the charge for it. Â Whatever orange sauce they had on the side was extremely salty. Â Overall I don't think I'll be coming back to dine here :/",https://www.yelp.com/biz/rangoon-brooklyn-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sonya M.,/user_details?userid=iHShoRPpwHdqBilkQA7qPQ,"La Porte, TX",9/27/2022,5.0,"I was visiting family in Brooklyn this weekend and my daughter said I just had to try this Burmese restaurant on Park Place. I'm so glad I did. For my starter I ordered the Tea Leaf Salad. It consisted of Burmese fermented tea leaves, peanuts, fried beans, toasted seeds and lime juice. It was crunchy and had flavors I've never had all combined in one dish. It was amazing. For my appetizer I ordered the Onion Fritter. It was made with potato and onions and was also gluten-free. The dipping sauce was tamarind and garlic. It had such unique flavors my description will not do it any Justice. Â It was the perfect amount of crunchy. I could have stopped there but I just wanted to order one of everything on that menu! I finally decided on the Coconut Chicken Noodle Soup. The broth was seared to perfection. It was adorned by coconut shreds, red onions and topped with an egg that was mildly cooked. Â I washed it all down with a 16oz Sparkling Water, although, there were many drinks to choose from. I wish I would've had room for the tapioca. If you live or visit New York, make sure you treat yourself to this wonderful place. I was even able to meet the Chef, Pablo. He came out after every dish and made sure I was happy!

Giving this place four stars only because the service was slow, but it was a Saturday night so that's understandable. We would've ordered more drinks and tried to get the waitress' attention several times but wound up giving up. However, the decor was beautiful--we sat outside and enjoyed the setup; there are string lights, curtains to separate dining parties, and flowers. For our meals, we started with the onion fritters (one of our favorite items), and the tea leaf salad. For mains, my partner had the chicken curry and devoured every last bite; I got the garlic noodles with shrimp--also amazing, and because there was such a generous portion, I took what I couldn't eat to go. Drink-wise, I had the Kayay Lan, which is a mix of Prosecco and lychee -- amazing! My partner started with the Nhint Ko Tu but switched over to the Kayay Lan.

Ching L.,/user_details?userid=BSLLqm1ft2Ilwz0TkZyAJA,"Irvine, CA",7/29/2021,3.0,"This place is okay. After having the tea leaf salad at Burma superstar in San Francisco, the one here is less flavorful and kind of disappointing. I also got the tamarind pumpkin stew which was tasty but also wasn't very different from a dal (Indian lentil curry). Also everything in the stew was very soft except for the pumpkin (kabocha squash) which was still a little hard with a slight crunch - kind of a jarring texture in the stew. I would have preferred it to be much cooked more. My fiancÃ© loooove his meat dish though so maybe a good place for non-vegetarians. Outdoor seating area is nice though- they have a garden in the back away from the street bustle & tables are covered from rain.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/rangoon-brooklyn-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Lilli S.,/user_details?userid=-UA3I1NQIdLZSy7ZHrJNKw,"Brooklyn, NY",8/20/2021,5.0,"Sat in the lovely, big, dare I say romantic back yard area. Each table very cutely curtained off from the others so it was a nice private dining experience - perfect for a date or a dinner where maybe you want to actually hear what your friends are saying. The wine and beer list is the most impressive I've seen from a restaurant, or bar for that matter, in a while. Nice selection of orange wines, the two we tried were excellently weird, perfect for summer, perfectly paired with the appetizer salads, and the waiter made a recommendation for a bottle of chilled red which was even better. As for appetizers, the tea leaf salad is a refreshing, healthy must try and the onion fritters are a not so healthy but totally worth it must try. Their texture and taste exceeds even what you think they will taste by looking at them like and the sauce that comes with them I wanted to bottle up and put on everything. The pork salad sounds like an oxymoron but it is also refreshing, light, and full of flavors for your bored palate. And for dinner, I had to try the mohinga lemongrass fish soup with noodle (and onion fritter!) which I will definitely be coming back for, and my friends got the tamarind pumpkin stew, the braised pork in banana leaf, and the chicken soup. The noodles and taste of the chicken soup were absolutely heartwarming, as was the pumpkin stew which seemed like a really nice option for those trying to stay healthy. We also got the crispy anchovies (with nice big chunks of crispy garlic!) and fish relish sides, which if you're a fish freak like me you must get. Also. Get the coconut rice. Get a couple of orders of it. The staff is really friendly and dare I say really fashionable and also knowledgeable about the cuisine. Overall, come hungry, come thirsty, and don't come expecting Thai, or Chinese or whatever the heck you're expecting. If you aren't familiar with Burmese food, be prepared to be lead on a delicious new adventure that will feature flavors you are familiar with and didn't expect, and flavors you've never tasted before. I wish I had more pictures of the entrees but the orange wine was getting to me by then and they were coming out a little blurry...",https://www.yelp.com/biz/rangoon-brooklyn-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Paul O.,/user_details?userid=e6nIyiFv-n8djOyxjdv8qA,"New York, NY",5/15/2021,2.0,"I'd been waiting to eat at Rangoon for a very long time. The place is always packed, the decor is beautiful, and the photos of the food looked amazing, but the food was incredibly disappointing. Let me start with one of the most popular dishes in the tea leaf salad--it was refreshing, I guess, but it lacked flavor. I could barely taste the tea leaf, and the lemon in the dressing overpowered the rest of the ingredients and it did not go well with the tartness of the tea leaf. Then we ordered the second most popular dish in the lemon grass fish soup. The broth did not have any kick to it, it just tasted like green curry with a little bit of lemon grass. There was no fish flavor (or fish), and the noodles were overcooked. The egg was cooked well, but that's about it. At that point we were 0 for 2, so I decided to try a cocktail, which was actually pretty good. To wrap up the already disappointed night, we decided to try their only dessert in the menu and ordered coconut tapioca, which was literally just coconut milk and tapioca, absolutely pedestrian and anyone can make that at home. The tapioca did not taste homemade, and the coconut milk wasn't even sweet. So to summarize: terrible food, good ambiance, descent cocktails. Two stars, but I will not recommend it to anyone.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/rangoon-brooklyn-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

When Rangoon opened as a restaurant, I was eager to eat here but my first experience was bad: slow service and cold and bland food. When I posted a negative review, Daniel the owner reached out to me immediately and asked for a second chance. It was very clear that he actually cared about peoples experience at Rangoon, and he really took care of us the second time around. Everything was on time, food was delicious and hot, and the khauswe, which is one of my most favorite foods of all time, was amazing. The shrimp and papaya salad was one of the best salads I've ever had, the onion fritters were tasty and the drinks were great. The garlic noodles were on the saltier side, but the shrimp was soooooo good. We also had the tapioca dessert which was incredible and because it was taking a little while for that to come, Daniel got us some dessert wine to pair and it all went really well togther! 5 starts for the whole second experience, its wonderful to see restaurant owners actually care about someones negative experience and try to amend that.

I like the old school look of it. I also liked that our table had a hook next to it where we could put our coats. Service was great and really fast! As for the food, we had the bacon appetizer which was alright. We shared the ribeye for two and the German potatoes for our meal. I thought the steak was a little bland, although I did like the Peter Luger sauce. I would have liked more flavor on the steak. The potatoes were okay but I would have liked more menu options for sides like I've seen at other steak houses. The drinks were delicious. We also had the sundae for dessert which was really good and the whipped cream was really tasty. Overall a good experience.

Annie N.,/user_details?userid=zegMcPCeyd3kjKRP0b5V1w,"Brooklyn, NY",1/6/2023,4.0,Came here two days ago for a friends birthday and this is my second time here. Definitely recommend making reservations because this place was packed on a Wednesday and from what I hear it's packed everyday of the week. We ordered 2 porterhouse for 2 and 2 rib steak and I personally preferred the rib steak over the porterhouse because one side of it was good and the other was very dry even though we asked for medium rare one side came out medium well. Love the Peter Luger sauce and the bacon was a hit with the group. We also got tomato and onion and the creamed spinach... I enjoyed the spinach. Waiters were friendly and liquor was strong (the old fashioned) is a popular drink here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

A friend from out of town scored us a reservation for 5pm and the place was already packed. We arrived 10 minutes early and were seated promptly by the window. We ordered their porterhouse for 2 , ribeye for 2, and creamed spinach to go with our steaks. The steaks were cooked to a perfect medium rare and paired well with their sauce. Â Our favorite was their ribeye which had the perfect amount of fat in each bite.

We had to make reservations a month in advance so make sure to plan accordingly. We expected a very upscale atmosphere but actually it was quite laid back and casual which was great. The food was amazing. The steak (ribeye for two) was absolutely cooked to perfection and was extremely flavorful and tender. Everything we had was great and I would highly recommend.

I had to email Peter Luger for party of 12. They respond really fast and very professional. One thing is that I forgot to mention my mom is on a wheel chair, and they didn't tell us that we reserved the table on the second floor. Â However!! When they saw my mom couldn't even get up on the steps they were soo helpful and found a table for us on the main floor. The service was wonderful. We ordered bacons, fries, onion rings, steaks, bottles of wine and dessert. The service was extremely extraordinary! Very friendly and helped with my moms dietry needs as well for her salmon.

It takes a lot for us to visit the same rest twice because of how many restaurants there are in NYC but we have visited here a total of two times now. I do recommend making reservations a week or two ahead of time because this place gets packed for dinner. The service is great and everyone is very friendly.

Food is always great, if not better this time around. We ordered Ribeye for Two and Steak for Two this time. They are all delicious. Ribeye's great if you want more tender and sizzling meat. For sides we ordered German potatoes, Fresh broccoli -- which was surprisingly really really good -- and the OG cream spinach.

Sheila W.,/user_details?userid=YM5iP-OVhh9WWEZnwenneg,"Dania Beach, FL",1/28/2023,1.0,The ribeye steak for two was tough and chewy. It was not good quality at all. Â We were a party of 6 and no one enjoyed the steak. The burger was dry and over cooked. We ordered it medium and it came well done. The lamb chops were good though. A bit chewy but overall was the best meat order. The Caesar salad was nice. I think that was our only enjoyment. I don't think we would return again. This establishment is definitely for the name and history but not what we expected. I wanted a nice cut of beef that melted in your mouth. We received a tough experience.

Izais R.,/user_details?userid=mhGSo7XK18KcMBz2BSqh9Q,"Brighton Beach, NY",12/22/2022,4.0,"I've been to multiple steak houses are NYC and Peter Luger steakhouse has always been on my list, I was finally able to get reservations for my fiancÃ©'s birthday and was extremely exited to finally try one of New Yorks most iconic steak houses. Upon arrival you immediately notice all of the Michelin star and zafar awards on the wall, so naturally I was excited to see what all the rave was about. We was seated almost immediately and w few minutes later a waiter approached our table with water, a bread basket and the menus. The first thing we noticed was the extremely limited menu options, it was a bit disappointing that the there was barely any appetizer or side options. For starters we got the Peter Luger sizzling bacon, the bacon was probably the best bacon I've ever had, it was delicious and perfectly cooked. For the main we had the rib-eye steak for two with a side of Peter Luger special German fries. You can hear your steak enter the room because of that signature sizzle adding onto the anticipation. When our food arrived at the table, the waiter warned of us about the extremely hot plate and served steak and fries to each of our plates. The moment was finally here, it was time to dig in, the steak tasted like a high quality steak but lacked flavor, it seems like they rely on the flavor of the Peter Luger sauce they provided. After our meal we got the holy cow Sunday for desert, the Sunday was a perfect size to share. Once we were done, our check was brought to us with chocolate gold coins. All in all, the service was amazing, the wait staff was extremely friendly and attentive making the experience amazing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The waiter made us all feel welcomed and naturally I began to reminisce about walking by every night on my way home from school. The ambiance was of a traditional steakhouse. You could enjoy good conversation and appreciate your food without loud music. The waiter finished the meal with bringing a delicious chocolate mousse cake for my parents.

The steaks are damn good the spinach is amazing the fries are more than likely fried in beef tallow and the desserts are to die for don't sleep on the lamb chops! I highly recommend you give them a try you can get a single order and have them cut them in half down the middle so that way you can get up to four people a taste of the delicious lamb as well as steak. We had the T-bone for two a ribeye and the lamb chops. Don't forget the shrimp cocktail, wedge salad, as well as all the other amazing things. The onion rings are very good as well.

The salad was dressed perfectly and the bacon and potatoes were good (nothing special though). The steak was cooked exactly how we wanted it (medium rare) and contained both ribeye and filet mignon cuts. Portion size was more than enough that we probably could've been good with getting just the steak for 2. Overall, everyone enjoyed the meal and service was attentive.

I came here not expecting much but was blown away by how good the steak was. We ordered the bacon, steak for three, and the german fried potatoes. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and each piece was deliciously tender with just the right amount of fat. It also had great flavour and did not require additional seasonings or sauces. The bacon was a nice starter and didn't feel too heavy, perfect for sharing. And the german potatoes complimented the steak well. It's definitely a treat and an experience coming here but we all found it to be very well worth it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I would skip the bacon, tomatoes and onions, and sides. The bacon wasn't anything special. The Holy Cow sundae was good and super decadent. Service was great, our waiter was funny and very attentive.

Michelle B.,/user_details?userid=ERHxf4y90v1O3JlKljxiqg,"Cambridge, MA",7/22/2022,5.0,This place is incredible. Went to the city specifically to try it out after getting a recommendation from someone while I was on vacation abroad. It definitely lives up to they hype! The serving for the steak for 2 was large (we could barely finish it because there was so much) and the quality was top notch. The waiters offered to give us the bone in a bag to take back from our steak to give to our dog. Overall very friendly and attentive staff. Will be back! I heard the salmon and burgers are also amazing. You really can't go wrong here! Just be warned that it's cash only and you should prob make a reservation far in advance.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Hieu T.,/user_details?userid=EPq9iJqtvS2TIjfqtnlwBQ,"Houston, TX",7/16/2022,5.0,"Out of all my NYC trips, I finally got to try the famous Peter Luger's Steakhouse. I will tell you right off the bat, it did not disappoint. I have been watching videos and shows on them for years and I was so psyched that I got to finally try it. The Pat LaFrieda dry aged steaks were cooked to perfection and the service and presentation are on point. We also tried the beef bacon, which was amazing, and you have to get the tomato and onions to pair with it, as it is a little salty. German smashed potatoes were also a hit! I think the Steaks for 3 was a little much for even us four guys, but having a little extra is better than not having enough. I think ribeye for 2 would have been enough for us four to be honest. Amazing! It definitely lived up to the name and hype that we were expecting.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Eli D.,/user_details?userid=dNoxS31PuQ4uNRxPr5YVWw,"New York, NY",9/23/2022,4.0,"Peter Luger is an iconic NYC steakhouse you must experience, even if it's just once! I visited during lunch, which is recommended if you're looking for a more low key dining experience. I recommend making reservations, but you can get a seat at the bar most times. Expect old NY steakhouse service! I ordered the Luger-Burger with cheese, bacon (highly recommended), and fries. It was cooked perfectly at medium rare. Overall it was a super tasty burger and very filling! It's obviously on the more expensive side of the burger spectrum & overall pricing for food, which is why I think this institution gets bad reviews, but I left feeling happy & content. I look forward to returning for a steak dinner experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The food is delicious and stays true to itself in what they're about. The Steak for Two was made perfectly and still cuts and melts in your mouth like butter. We ordered our steak medium rare, as they recommend, but some parts were a little too red for me. The sides are true steak sides and we ordered the must haves - the German potatoes, creamed spinach, and a thick slice of bacon. The bacon is my favorite and you won't find anything else like it. At the end, we ordered the Holy Cow sundae. So thick and delicious, but sooo good. And of course, we got the Peter Luger coins after. Food was great, but service was really lacking. The waiter wasn't very attentive and kept forgetting things, like my glass of wine, the napkins we asked for, my coffee at the end of the meal, and the coins.

The lamp chops looked amazing and my mother said they were. We enjoyed a side of broccoli. I have to admit it was well seasoned. I enjoyed the key lime pie. The pecan pie was absolutely terrible. I placed an order for a single steak to go. I was told that steak was amazing as well. The takeout orders are placed in a foil lined paper bag. It really keeps the moisture, heat and flavor in the food. There was no need to reheat the food. I would have given this place five stars if I didn't feel rushed by my waiter. I would definitely recommend and return!

While I usually see Peter Luger's extra-thick cut bacon at my local supermarket, I did not realize how thick the cuts actually are. The Luger's Sizzling Bacon was my personal highlight of this meal. The bacon, along with some of the other appetizers, is the main reason that I'll come back here. Although I didn't enjoy the Creamed Spinach as much, their other offerings in the Fresh Broccoli, Baked Oversized Potato with Sour Cream, and Luger's Special German Fried Potatoes were exceptional. The broccoli provided a green color to the overall meal and was well-seasoned. The baked potato was soft, delicious and paired extravagantly with the sour cream.

Then 2 of the thickest cuts of bacon came and you guessed it, went perfect with the steak sauce. The only thing that didn't need the steak sauce was the porterhouse.

J. L.,/user_details?userid=LuNuLLDe2Zq0NncOhV5S3Q,"San Francisco, CA",10/23/2022,4.0,"I had a craving for a burger, but I didn't want the usual burger. So I found the PL burger review on Infatuation NYC, and I can say that the burger is delicious. However, it's a hearty burger, much like biting into a full-on steak. It's very filling and is even better when you add the extra thick bacon to it, which adds a smokey and fatty flavor dimension to an already great burger. It's excellent in its simplicity. However, I do wish they had the option to add sharp aged Cheddar cheese instead of plain American, but the burger was still good. I think they need to fix the fries, they're a bit bland, and I would have liked sweet potato fries instead as an option. However, I will say I didn't eat too many of the fries because I was already so full from the burger. I like that I could add my condiments. I am a fan of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle BBQ sauce with this burger. It worked well with the burger, cheese, and bacon. The other thing I will mention is if you're doing a pickup order as I did through Caviar, you need to go around to the left side until you come to a grated steel door with a doorbell next to it. Push the door, and the employee with open the door and ask you the name of your order. It's a bit confusing where to pick up your orders, and I wished they had a sign that tells you where to go as a random gentleman directed me out front to the proper location. I will say it's been a while since I last came here, but I noticed the place has a much posher crowd for a Saturday night than years ago, where ever was dressed in business attire as opposed to casual or business casual. However, it could have been that that was the type of crowd that was there that night as opposed to the norm.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This place has been talked about my whole life about how amazing the steak is and how it takes forever to get a reservation and it's well known. If i'm paying that much for a steak but i'm looking at what looks like the inside of a 1600's tavern, I was turned off. I felt over dressed, thinking this is a nice place but it's a bar with expensive steak. that's it. The steak was like the rest of these reviews, OK at best. I was told that if they're giving you steak sauce without asking that's a red flag and that they are aware that the quality isn't as good as they portray and the rest of my party was just as disappointed. I enjoyed my meal, but i wouldn't come back here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You can feel the history and smell the steaks cooking. Steaks are served family style in a German great hall. Diners vary from businessmen to families dressed casually. Steaks are tender and flavorful, but the menu is limited. I would say the best part of the experience is the restaurant's beautiful old world charm and setting. Kids love to go- staff is always very friendly to everyone, but especially the children. They pass out these special chocolate ""Peter Luger gold coins"" to the kids and they absolutely love them!

This is ""My""review !1st I would like to qualify by saying I have ate at 2-3 maybe 4 Michelin star restaurants as well as some very upper end of quality restaurants. Peter Luger, I hadthe steak for 3 creamed spinach and German potatoes. The steak was almost VERY Good but I just can't label it anything higher than a good good steak! Â The German potatoes were good but they were Â very similar to square cut hash browns from a dinner I'm sorry but they were good but there is nothing about them or the steak that would justify the reputation this place has. I just don't see it nor taste it. The creamed spinach was excellent more spinach then cream but excellent flavor.Now to the ambiance . Plain Jane it probably looked the same 100+ yrs ago which there's nothing wrong with but if you never been here but heard about it, you kind of expecting something more especially considering this is supposed to be the best. Not in my book. Service was good food came out fairly quick and waiter was attentive. But I spent $300 I was just expecting more!

Mari M.,/user_details?userid=fVQSrjVgpbOJHzu-0RGVkw,"Hawaii Kai, Honolulu, HI",3/11/2022,5.0,"Best steakhouse ever! We had reservations for Saturday at 2pm. We arrived a little early and were seating within a few minutes. It's funny how the waiter tried to be really ""gruff"" with us at the beginning but by the end of the meal he fell out of character! Haha! The bread is delicious and the onion bread was awesome. It was full of onion in the middle. We ordered the creamed spinach, onion rings, German fried potatoes, steak for two medium and apple strudel for dessert. The creamed spinach was amazing and I completely understand the hype. It's not stringy or watery and has the perfect flavor IMO. The onion rings are perfectly crunchy and battered and went well with ketchup and the signature Peter Luger steak sauce. The sauce itself was on another level- bbq sauce plus horseradish and bursting with flavor that complimented not only the steak but the sides too. The German fried potatoes are like home fries but better! The steak was cooked well maybe slightly under but we were able to use the residual heat from the plate to cook those underdone areas a little more. It is slanted on the table so you can scoop up as much butter and meat juice as you want. Our sweet waiter split our apple strudel and it came with a HUGE bowl of whipped cream. Apple strudel was cinnamon and sugary delicious. It was too much food for the two of us so we have dinner! Will definitely be back next time we're in NYC! Can't wait for the Vegas location to open!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sing Y.,/user_details?userid=NBMr4FJSLsT-u1iPRcdBOQ,"London, United Kingdom",9/14/2021,5.0,I used to go to the Peter Lugers in great neck as a child and boy did the Brooklyn chain not disappoint. It's a little on the pricier side and they only take debit or cash but it reminded me of old school American steak house deliciousness . The salads were dressed to perfection. The steak cooked a perfect medium rare melted in my mouth. The home style onion rings and German potatoes were bomb. You pay for the ambiance and great service (don't forget the unlimited sauce and bread) along with cute gold coins at the end. If your looking for a place to splurge that's quite reasonable with great food ratings go here!! It was around 90/pp counting tip and drinks so wasn't too bad for nyc. There is only street parking which can be a little tricky. Make sure to have a reservation as it was quite full on a Tuesday night!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The hubs said he went with some work colleagues when we first met and i was green with envy. So this last trip to New York my friend and i huffed it from Manhattan to have this long awaited meal. The staff while friendly rushed you through the meal making it feel more fast food than fine dining. It was super bright inside unlike most steak houses. It's definitely a no frills menu. Started with a wedge salad that had the thick cut bacon cut up on top. That was very flavorful. I had the $61 ""steak for one"" and was underwhelmed. Got a side of creamed spinach and a baked potato. The potato was plain with a bowl of sour cream nearby. The wine list by the glass was types no brands. I'm fine with house wine but at $14 a glass it should be a little higher quality. Overall I'm glad i tried it but i don't need to go back. To be fair a nearby table of guys celebrating a bachelor party scarfed all their food down and chewed on the bone of their steak. All that to say i think it's a personal preference thing.

Good thing my wife enjoyed hers, otherwise it would have been a big disappointment.

Brendan R.,/user_details?userid=7OG0vQjr5GipQbudFG4ETg,"Sanford, NC",8/18/2022,2.0,"I've heard so many great things about this restaurant. I wanted this dining experience to be head and shoulders above the other fine steakhouses I've been to but sadly, it wasn't. You would think that a landmark spot like this with 135 years of operational experience, would completely impress a customer but it fell very far below my expectations. For starters, I would compare this restaurant to an Â expensive Golden Corral without all the food options. There is no dress code whatsoever and while this may be the appeal for some, I would expect that a restaurant that serves a $140 T-Bone steak, would enforce a better dress code. The menu was terribly limited. Of course steak was the main course, the sides only consisted of fried potatoes, baked potato (if available. I didn't ask) broccoli and creamed spinach. Our waiter had the personality of a soap dish and was as stale and cold and as the complimentary bread assortment that came out. At least put it in a warmer so when you serve it, it will melt the cold, foil wrapped, butter that accompanies it. While eating our meal at our table, a cleaning person actually swept around us with a broom and a dust pan on a stick. Completely inappropriate while in the process of dining. I saw on three separate occasions, the same waiter counting his cash tips in front of the entire dining room. Not only does this look completely tasteless, this guy is handling filthy money then serving customers food to them with no sanitary prep whatsoever. After waiting three weeks for the reservation date, I was disappointed and wished I had selected another, more quaint, steak restaurant in NYC. This place is a feedlot and nothing more. Herds of vacationers are corralled in for over priced beef and spirits with no consideration for a quality dining experience Â in a Brooklyn landmark. Don't waste your time or hard earned money. Either save your money and actually go to a Golden Corral ( there is a much better selection) or go to Keen's Steakhouse in Midtown South like we should have.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

As we were leaving, their incredibly arrogant manager attacked me in front of our friends saying ""we are Peter Luger!"" and can not accept a check made out to Signature Bank.

We finally made the pilgrimage this summer and enjoyed our experience there. We ordered steak for two ($129.90) and Lugar's Special German Fried Potatoes for two ($15.95). Both were fabulous. We asked that our steak be cooked medium, and it arrived exactly as requested. Service was quick and professional. All round great experience. Need to address the question, however - did this Michelin-starred restaurant make the best steak we ever had? Respectfully, no. A month prior, we ordered steak at a fancy Greek restaurant in Midtown, Manhattan (not fair to name names) and the meat was far more flavorful. We expected a good meal at the Midtown joint but were actually blown away. New York City has so many choices.

Had a reservation and was seating immediately in the upstairs room. Staring with the bread, it was cold and not the softest. The highlight of the meal has to be the bacon slice. Was very good! Ordered a steak for two, which was good, but not the best. The steak sauce they had was interesting as well, almost like a sweet and sour sauce. I always thought having a sauce would take away from the natural meat flavor, which is why some other steakhouses take offense when you ask for it. So it was different that they have it included with all the steaks. Ended with the ice cream sundae, had good whipped cream.

Jack L.,/user_details?userid=Q5kDBdriCbWnqalMbTBT-Q,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",9/12/2022,5.0,"Peter Lugar's didn't disappoint! It never does. I first came to Peter Lugar's steakhouse (Williamsburg Location) when I was a young kid, and ever since it's always a treat. I most recently went to this historic steak house for my birthday in August and the quality is always top of the notch. This historic restaurant has been around for over a century (1887 to be exact), and they continue to perfect their craft. The steaks are dry aged in house for at least 4 weeks and the flavor is incredible. They come out sizzling, on an extremely hot plate and have been cooked to perfection every time I have been. I like my steak rare or medium rare and it has been spot on. Depending on party size, you can get a steak for one, two, three, or four people. The steaks are very large so be ready to feast. My server for this last time was named Danny and he's been at Peter Lugar for 19 years and he was helpful with all his food recommendations and was also very attentive. He even got the staff to sing Happy Birthday and the whole restaurant chimed in. I went without a reservation, which is a bit risky on a Friday night because they are usually packed. My family and I were seated in 10 minutes, but only because we got their early enough (around 5:30). I would recommend calling in advance- multiple weeks prior if you and your party would like to go at a specific date and time. Each time I come to Peter Lugar, I always start off with the thick cut bacon which is grilled and flavorful. They are also famous for their tomato and onion plater. It comes with a side of their famous Peter Lugar steak sauces which is delicious, and you can dip just about anything in it. It respectfully blows the likes of A1 sauce out of the water. If you like a great burger Peter Lugar has that too. It is made from their dry aged steak as well (cheese and their famous bacon can be added too). Unfortunately, they stop serving their burgers at 3:45 (end of lunch). Lunch reservations are usually not too difficult to get. They also have a full open bar, which is easy to get seating at if you come with a small party. They also have plenty of traditional steakhouse sides, such as creamed spinach and fries that you can order for the table. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse cake with Peter Lugar's famous homemade Schlag (whipped cream). That was also fantastic, and I would gladly get it again. Peter Lugar is also famous for their massive milkshake which also hits the spot if you are looking for something sweet. Peter Lugar's steakhouse is on the more expensive side but is worth it for special occasions in my opinion. Lastly, they don't accept credit cards, unless it is their own, so come ready with cash. My favorite steak resides here at the famous New York steak institution, Peter Lugar.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Billy B.,/user_details?userid=RV0fUypFGCUlvQJDvOcfWA,"New York, NY",10/20/2021,3.0,"I finally had the opportunity to check out the legendary Peter Luger's last night for a birthday celebration. Man, was I disappointed. I'm not sure if my expectations were just too high, but let me start with the service. Our server was cold and just plain unpleasant. He wasn't super helpful when it came to the menu and almost made us feel like he was annoyed that we were there and dumb for asking a question. He barely checked on our table and we had to wait at least 40 minutes for our check at the end of our meal as he went MIA until we asked TWO different servers if we can have the bill. I can't say this was the same service as a whole though because we noticed other tables next to us were being well taken care of by other servers. The food was just OKAY. Not the worst, but also not the best. It was very old school, bland and nothing spectacular. I had the Cesar salad (hard to mess up), steak for two (medium), jumbo shrimp cocktail (wasn't a fan), and creamed spinach (didn't taste fresh, almost like it was frozen spinach). We then had the ""Holy Cow Sundae"" which was tasty and the chocolate mousse cake, which was hard as a rock, and again not that appetizing. It's a place to check out if you're into the history of the establishment, but definitely not a place I'd want to return to. One VERY IMPORTANT last thing I noticed, at least on the night I was here, was the lack of diversity in the staff which consisted mainly of middle-aged white men from what I observed. It was a little uncomfortable and made it feel like this is more of a ""boys club"" type of place in my opinion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Initially, we were disappointed to be placed upstairs, in the corner. However, we were excited to enjoy the food and what others have stated about this historic restaurant. Even before arriving, our taxi driver said we could get a better steak and experience in the city, but we just knew he was wrong; boy, was he right! For my husband, the food was average, but for me, it was BELOW average. The bread was cold, the drinks were horrible, and the steak was bland. If we had to pick the best part, it would be the Caesar salad with chopped bacon, which is why I'm giving it two stars. This was our first and last visit.

Jhanio D.,/user_details?userid=IdJVKP-Tgs7hiiSRwNJ1rA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/5/2021,5.0,"Peter Luger was a bucket list dining experience for a while, so I was excited to finally snag a reservation this past July. I read many reviews online that I'd have to wait to be sat, even with a table booked, so I arrived with a few minutes to spare before my reservation time. Fortunately, my party was sat immediately. Upon being seated, I noticed the diverse crowd - there were large groups of tourists, couples celebrating, business men wining and dining, and even a table of (what looked like) teenagers, all pulling together their cash to pay for their meal. One thing that was consistent was the server, who was a total pro. No matter who he was speaking to, our server was personable and knowledgeable. Needless to say, he had been here for years and definitely knew the ins and outs of service. To me, service alone can make or break a meal, so this immediately impressed me. Our food, too, though, was incredible. From the negronis to the bacon and even to the complimentary bread, I kept wondering what could possibly top the last dish. Obviously, the answer was, the steak. For our main meal, we ordered the porterhouse for two along with the german potatoes and the spinach. Between the two sides, I personally loved the spinach. I ate all I could of the steak, wanting to savour the experience, but still was able to take home a small amount as leftovers, which were still great the next day. And, to top it all off, our course, we wrapped up our meal with a pile of the chocolate coins (so many, in fact, that I still have some at home months later). My entire experience was everything I hoped it would be. I can't recommend this place enough for anyone looking to celebrate or even just have a memorable meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kenny N.,/user_details?userid=nidnBQiIC5TxeofvnVqWtA,"Duluth, GA",8/28/2021,5.0,"Located in Brooklyn, it was challenging to find parking spot on the street. Nevertheless I found one near by the restaurant. Â Made a reservation for 3:15pm, because it was the only time available on the same day. Â As I entered the restaurant no one was wearing a mask, and at the same time they asked for the covid19 vaccination card. Â Luckily everyone was vaccinated in my party and we were allow to dine in. Â We ordered the steak for two, and burger and fries. There is a $5 service charge if you don't order anything. Pretty tight if you ask me. Â We were so hungry that we literally devoured their bread that our server brought out. Â When our steak came our server warned us it was very hot and I can hear the sizzling sound. Â He used two spoons to base the precut steaks with the grease and butter that was in the plate ( he tilted the plate). Â Before I can take a picture the our server gently put two pieces of precut steak and based with butter from the plate. Â I nonchalantly pick one with the fork and dipped into their house made steak sauce. And OMG this dry aged medium rare piece of steak was the best steak I've tasted in my life. Â And trust me I've eaten truck load of steaks in my life. At that moment I felt like I can eat the entire steak all by myself. Tried the burger it was ok, but not for $20. Thick cut fries tasted like well thick cut fries. Â I went back to the steak and it was back to the heaven.

The second confrontation came with a waiter, who wanted to move us even closer to the kitchen for his convenience. He needed to be told no emphatically. This was a caricature of hostile New York service, to the point where it was embarrassing.

Â So when we finally arrived at the restaurant, I was expecting the host and servers to be ""surly"". Â Couldn't have been further from the truth! The host was super friendly. Our server was awesome, answered all our questions and was just super nice and attentive throughout our meal! Maybe it's because they could tell we were tourists (we're from the SF Bay Area) but it was one of the best dining experiences ever! As for the steak? The porterhouse for two was the bomb!! So frickin' tender and juicy. One side NY steak, one side filet mignon. Best steak ever - right up there with the wagyu we had in Tokyo! The bacon appetizer was delicious, the steamed broccoli had an amazing garlic flavor and the ice cream sundae was the decadent dessert afterwards.

It has a rich smoky beefy taste. Bacon is a total gem and definitely doesn't feel like a sidekick. Make sure to have minimum 4 people in the party for Holy Cow dessert because it's a gigantic dessert.

Hank Z.,/user_details?userid=QGoNAGVeubu-LsCKH8UNTA,"New York, NY",7/31/2021,4.0,"I'm sure Peter Luger has been thoroughly reviewed on Yelp. What I will say is that the quality of the meat or the consistency of the quality has declined as this place became more and more touristy. In fact, the 4 times or so that I've been here have always been with friends from out of state or country, so I'm definitely not helping the issue. Personally, I think there are many other steakhouses in the city that are better without the crazy crowds and reservation chaos, however it's a NY institution, so everyone should try it at least once, and use it as a measuring stick for all steakhouses they will go to in the future.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Maybe a butter garlic sauce for the steak? Not jam. Wish they stuck to a stricter dress code. I like to feel like I'm going out to a fancy place. Not a Burger King with good food. Food a little over priced but the steak is cooked perfectly every time. I think the waiters could definitely be more attentive and the staff is horrible in the front. The fact that I made a reservation and had to wait in line... not happy. It was around 15 of us. We came in for our reservation and there was a line. They said they didn't have our reservation online even though I had a hold on my card for it.... Just not happy about the fact that I still got charged even though they were to busy to accommodate us. I still went back though eventually because the steak is great. It could have a fancier luxury look for the way the food is priced, but I guess they just want to serve you nice food in ugly place.

No wonder there is so much hype around Peter Lugers. This Brooklyn staple defines consistency. The service is stellar. The food is no fuss and hands down this is the best steak I have ever had. I'm sorry I didn't save room for dessert but I just couldnt stop eating this steak. Overpriced steakhouses like Mastros have nothing on this place.

Granted, I'm not a huge steak fan but my husband mentioned he would want steak for his birthday so instead of making it at home I took him out to Peter Luger. Initially wanted to get dinner reservations but they get booked almost a month ahead so we opted to come for lunch instead. Perhaps it was better that we did coz a steak lunch at Peter Luger's rightfully felt so indulgent. Anyway, definitely go! Eat steak. Revel in the amazing fact that such an institution exists.

Kendrick Lamar ate here so it has to be good, right? Wrong. When I think of high quality steak, I think of meat that melts in your mouth when you eat it just like how you know you're eating high quality sashimi if it melts on your mouth as you eat it. We ordered the steak (looks like a porterhouse) medium rare but it was burnt in some areas. While some pieces of the steak were good, I found myself giving my jaw a workout when chewing the meat. Not worth it for the price you pay. I definitely had better.

When me and my party arrived for our reservation the first thing the manager asked us is if we were vaccinated and if we had proof. I asked when did this happen and was told a couple days ago, you know, no biggie but the fact that he didn't ask the white couple that came in after us as we were finding the pictures of our cards kinda pissed me off but I let it go. Another manager stepped in and took us to our table. Then the server we had had an attitude from the beginning....not sure if it's normal for servers there to slam and throw shit on the tables but that's what happened. One of my friends decided he wasn't gonna eat anything there because of the shitty service. While the rest of my party were eating it seemed like another table that was just seated by the nice manager had issues with the crappy manager who was overlooking the reservations. And guess what they were Asian as well... this place seems to have something against Asians...a shitty way to end our day in New York....will not be going there in the future and that's probably what the management wants.

Finally the steak and fries - really really good- not unbelievably good but still really good which is what made this a 4 (actually should be 3.5 but there is no half so it's a 4)- go for the steak and go slightly tipsy so the rest won't matter!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The bread was served at room temperature but it was so tasty and the butter so rich that we didn't care.

I have always been curious with the dry age process and Peter Luger's name has always come, on topic. Friday, I finally had the opportunity to experience their high quality dry aged cuts yet simple preparation. First of all, the staff was fantastic and accommodating, the moment you walk in, you are greeted and welcomed. Enrique our waiter was fantastic and did not fit my expectation of what an established steak house server would be, young but extremely professional and knowledgably with the product. Let's get to the point, the reason for flying to New York! First bite was like, chewing into a meat gushier candy followed by a burst of umami.

Ken C.,/user_details?userid=UZ8_xqhiguIYb9Lu2Wu8og,"North Kingstown, RI",9/21/2019,5.0,"The hype is deserved! Â Peter Luger surpasses a mere ""woohoo"" - earned 6 stars in my book! This was the best steak I've ever had - and I've had a lot of red meat in my lifetime, in great steak houses in Dallas, Monterrey, Chicago - but Peter Luger tops them. Â I loved the simple menu - no BS, no larded descriptions, it's just porterhouse, sized for 2, 3, or 4 - and the only other steak options is a ribeye or a NY strip. Â That's it - unless, sadly, you don't eat red meat, then there's a token offering of salmon or sole. Â Peter Luger's steak is aged perfectly and grilled to perfection, juicy, minerally, toothsome but tender, and oh-so-flavorful. Â Wow. Â Service is great too, old-school, with a waitstaff that knows their stuff with that Â New York attitude that some can find off-putting but I find charming. Â We started off with an appetizer of their home-cured Luger's bacon - and omg, what a slice of fantastic pork belly that is. Â Sizzling, crisped, fatty and meaty - just tell your doctor it's a bucket list item and you won't do it again (but you know you will if you get any chance at this again!). Â Our group of 9 shared three ""Steak for 3"" and they were perfect for our appetites, sliced off the bone into meaty, tender chunks. Â Plenty of sides to choose from, but the focus is on the meat, naturally. Â Solid wine list as well. Â And I liked the touch at the end, scattering handfuls of Peter Luger gold-foil wrapped chocolate coins on the table. Â Great fun and a terrific experience. Â Be warned, no credit cards, so bring plenty of cash, but they will also take your debit card (and empty the account, but it's worth it!).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Amazing steak, super buttery and juicy, served on a super hot plate. I recommend to follow their suggestion and order medium rare. The waiters are real professionals and do a great job. Strongly recommend to start with the bacon as a starter (super thick and super good). Also recommend the pecan pie with their homemade whipped cream. Extremely expensive but worth it.

Brad B.,/user_details?userid=MWlWUQBHv7jbxhnay6UCQQ,"Manhattan, NY",10/27/2019,4.0,I used to have a charge account here. When I used to go here all the time the clientele was 80% local 20% tourist now it's the opposite but still doesn't take away from what Brooklyn used to be in the old days. Ronnie the manager Nigel the bartender and the waiters still have the flavor of real Brooklyn. Our waiter Lou was great even though he's only been there 15 years the oldest waiter just retired after 52 years at Peter Luger's. The steak is good not great drowned in butter as usual but in all the years I've been here I've never had the Canadian bacon which is a must order. The onion rings were delicious cream spinach as usual great tomato and onions with a special sauce always good. If you have never been here you have to go. There are very few places left that still have that flavor of real New York. Only cash and don't order desert.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You can use it as a dip for your bread or just go ahead and slurp it down because it's that good!! I wish I asked if they actually sell it.

You have to make reservations 1-2 months ahead of time because this place is famous for it's world class steak and everyone knows it. I went with a group of friends and we got the porter house steak for 3 but 4 of us split it and we still couldn't finish the entire steak even though it tasted delicious. We also got the creamed spinach which was good, but not the best I've ever had. The sizzling slab of bacon was delicious as well- definitely recommend this juicy appetizer if you like pork. We wanted to try the Luger-burger because we got positive reviews about it- the burger was also good but not to die for. My vegetarian friend got the salmon and it tasted juicy- steakhouses do have the best salmon.

The guy on the phone told me February 5 so I made the reservation for that day at 5:45. I called the day prior (February 4) to confirm the reservation and a lady answered the phone. She stated to me that she did not see the reservation for February 5th but did see one for February 9th which is a Wednesday at 5:45. I told her it was an error on the restaurants end because I would never make a reservation 3 weeks prior for a weekday. She also rudely said that it was a girl I spoke to on January 10 when I made the reservation. I ensured her it was a male but I can tell she thought I was lying. She was very rude and said there is nothing she can do. This caused a huge inconvenience for my wife and I being we made arrangements for a baby sitter and changed around our plans. I've eaten there before and obviously the food is great but will never go back because of the way I was treated.

Kathleen S.,/user_details?userid=NjONx9AOZSjjZjBFPee7BA,"Centereach, NY",12/29/2019,4.0,"Reservations were easy to make online, and both text and phone confirmations were received prior to the date. Upon arrival, we were greeted immediately. Once seated in the dining room bread was placed on the table. The rolls had onions on top and inside which were quite delicious. There was also another breadstick type of bread but we preferred the onion one. Drinks are not listed on the menu and you need to request another menu if looking to browse the options. I asked the waiter for the list of beers on tap and he named them for me. I ordered a Brooklyn lager and as stated on the back of their menu, the drink was oversized and a generous pour. Â As an appetizer we ordered the thick sliced bacon which comes by the slice, so we got two. The waiter brought them over and said as they were on the small side they gave us a third piece to make up for it. The bacon is tasty and a must try for sure. As an entree we ordered the steak for two, and appetizers we selected the German potatoes and onion rings. The steak came pre-cut which was nice and it was still sizzling on the plate. While the potatoes were melt-in-your-mouth delicious, the onion rings were not up to par. The onion rings lacked favor and softened within minutes to a soggy consistency. Thankfully, there was plenty else to eat. All the sides can serve two or more people so sharing is definitely suggested. The steak was flavorful, and if it isn't for you, they provide their own Peter Lugers sauce in a gravy boat for extra seasoning. The service was fast and the wait staff was pleasant. The chocolate coins you receive with your bill are a nice bonus!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Melissa P.,/user_details?userid=584eMWpX_mwpZgrT0-G7WQ,"New York, NY",9/8/2018,4.0,"Everything is always amazing here! It's easier to get a lunch reservation than dinner and the menu is the same so it's still a great experience. We started with the wedge salad and Caesar salad. The dressing on the Caesar salad is amazing. Also the wedge salad comes with a slice of their thick cut bacon on top, which is amazing. We then got the porterhouse for 2, German potatoes and creamed spinach. The porterhouse for 2 can serve 3 people and it was cooked perfectly at medium rare.

Â Cheesecake is my favorite smothered with Schlag! Â I always take about 6 slices of bacon home to heat up for a few days (yum).

Although my friend and I didn't order any sides, we were more than satisfied with our portions. The meat was buttery, juicy, and tender, while the edges were perfectly charred. Now this is what you call medium-rare. They also cut the steak into small pieces for you and keep the bone on the plate in case you like to eat the remainder of the meat off the bone like I do. Unlike other steakhouses, Peter Luger didn't have that bougie vibe (extra point!) and it was pretty well-lit so you can actually SEE what you're eating.

The burguer is also really good.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Kent S.,/user_details?userid=ATrR_wA7Dm_6DKk-fP5iyw,"Ewa Beach, HI",10/23/2020,5.0,"Another place I was anxiously waiting to visit. Being that most places in NYC are closed, this trip was to focus on what is open. Our group elected to sit outside, DESPITE indoor dining still being available. We did lunch and my party had varied choices: one of us ordered the rib steak, it was an ENORMOUS portion, another had the hamburger and I chose the salmon. We all sampled everything, and nothing was less than perfect. The German potatoes and creamed spinach rounded out an excellent lunch. Strudel and coffee for dessert. Remember, they don't take credit cards for dine-in, we did cash and debit (Dutch treat) ... I would definitely return. For what it's worth, we took the subway from downtown to Marcy avenue, then WALKED back across the Williamsburg Bridge after that large lunch. I preferred the walk.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They've been in business since the 1800's and have rightfully earned themselves the number one spot on the list of best steakhouses in the country. On my recent trip up to the big Apple, we made reservations here months in advance. The porterhouse for two along with the German potatoes and creamed spinach were the main reasons we dined here. It is cash only so keep that in mind but it's worth every penny. The steak cut like butter, it was so decadent and rich-I couldn't stop myself from eating more than I probably should have. The taste of that juicy pink steak with the perfect sear on the exterior cooked to the perfect medium rare standard was worth the wait and the price. The wine list is minimal but perfectly selected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Our server was nice, I actually saw the male host shove someone to their seat which I couldn't believe my eyes lol whip cream they make I enjoyed and their cheese cake was standard.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Christin M.,/user_details?userid=383fieseMn4s6pHoNY7ugQ,"Baltimore, MD",1/25/2019,4.0,"Brooklyn Bucket List worthy for sure. This most recent visit was my third time around and there's comfort in the fact that not much changes at Peter Lugers. The intoxicating smells of steak that waft on Broadway outside the restaurant only intensify as you enter the door. The menu remains simple and the steak for -however many in your party- is an easy and delicious decision. The bread basket gets an A+ (just don't fill up on those onion rolls). I've ordered the sliced tomatoes and onions at the staff's suggestion during prior trips and was pretty disappointed. This time around we opted for the thick cut sizzling bacon slices (as other diners have suggested) and wow! Never passing on this appetizer again. The side order of the Special German Fried Potatoes was also a first for me as well. Our leftovers were packaged up in a neat doggie bag and were just as good the next day. Yes, it's cash only (a bummer given the high cost of the meal) and while I didn't have issue making a reservation (as others have. I'd suggest calling early on a Saturday or Sunday), we did end up having to dine at 5:45pm on a weekday to secure something sooner than later.

Alex D.,/user_details?userid=kUeEOfmZ5sqQuCuYdevNvA,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",12/15/2016,4.0,Had lunch reservations here. Had the steak for two and burger along with a salad and 2 glasses of wine and one vodka soda. The wait staff was extremely nice. Jack was our server. It wasn't as crowded as I expected it to be which was nice. The meal including tip was $220 which for a steakhouse I thought was extremely reasonable. And the food was delicious. Steak was tender and served on a hot plate and the burger was tasty as well. I'd recommend getting reservations. I called on a Wednesday and the only reservation time they had was for Sunday at 145pm. So it gets pretty full quick.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Well why make a reservation in the first place right? At least our waiter was funny and kind. In terms of steak, you really just have a ""steak"" for 1 and a porterhouse for 2-4 people. The sides were underwhelming and under seasoned except the onion rings. The meat was not bad but again, equally as good here in the city. Save your time and money and go somewhere else is my opinion.

So if you decide to stop by without a reservation good luck being served. It's located in Brooklyn right off the Williamsburg bridge. You can either drive or take the subway where the station is located a few blocks away. The steak however is amazing. It reminded me of Florentine steak which I had back in Florence. The steaks were huge I would say 4-5 pounds depending on which order you choose too try. We tried the steak that was good for 3 people even though there were 4 of us in the group we could barely finish it. The steak was cooked to our perfection medium rare and each bite you could just taste the tenderness and quality of the meat. Our server was prompt and very attentive.

Our server seemed a bit disinterested and placed our plates on the table very aggressively but I believe that is part of the culture of the restaurant. I ordered a steak for two, broccoli, the special German potatoes, thick cut bacon, and the chocolate mousse cake. The steak was good but the reason why I gave this place four stars is that it was very greasy and oily. It felt very heavy to digest.

We came for the steaks so we skipped the appetizers, much to the surprise of our waiter who seemed to push a bit for trying something. I just don't understand eating lettuce at places like this, it's just a waste of stomach space. Our party of 5 got the Steak for 4, along with three sides (spinach, onion rings, and the German potatoes). The portion size was perfect. The steak comes out pre-sliced, which I prefer, and our medium rare came out perfect.

We always order our steaks medium rare - the picture on the left is from Nov. 2018 and the picture on the right is from today. Both were Peter Luger steaks ordered medium rare.

He got a manager who looked at the steak and just said ""it's medium and also it's been sitting out"" with no apology or anything. It's a little ridiculous that a manager at a steakhouse does not know what medium rare looks like and we are expected to accept something not to our order.

It's exactly what it purports to be: an old school steakhouse. We came as a group of 4, waited a touch past our reservation time, which was fine because it gave us time for martinis at the bar - yum!. We ordered a large porterhouse to share as well as bacon and some sides. Everything was good. I found the service to be pleasantly old Brooklyn. I think this is probably someplace everyone should try because its an institution; but, ultimately it didn't blow my mind.

The shrimps really are huge and the sauce makes them even better. Their porterhouse steak is always made to perfection - medium rare, flavorful, juicy, and tender. When I first tasted their signature steak sauce, I wasn't sure how it would taste with steak since it does taste a bit like cocktail sauce, but I was surprised to find that it goes wonderfully with the steak. It adds that acidic bite to the very rich meat. Do order creamed spinach on the side! Another tip: order wine.

The knife cut through like butter and the temperature was perfect. Hands down the best steak I've ever had. Our side of creamed spinach and potatoes was the perfect compliment.

Michelle S.,/user_details?userid=N9m-ToOPrr_PIpMZJOUr5g,"Brooklyn, NY",7/14/2019,5.0,"48 hours later after eating at Peter Luger's I finally woke up from the food coma that ensued after feasting. I was warned that the food is so good it'll knock you out and that was true! I made reservations a month in advance and secured a time of 4:45pm on a Saturday. It wasn't busy and we were able to be seated when we arrived at 4:15pm. Our server was Danny and he was a very attentive server. We ordered a pellegrino (sparkling water helps digestion), bacon (2), porterhouse for 2, spinach and the potatoes. I have to say, the bacon was the best I've ever had. I've had bacon from all parts of the spectrum but this bacon brought me to heaven (and clogged my arteries). When the steak came, it was still sizzling in a pool of buttery goodness. My server basted the steak and then served it to me which was definitely a nice touch. The appetizers, spinach and potatoes were definitely up there as well. I've never had creamed spinach like the one at Peter Luger's, it definitely pairs well with the steak. For the steak itself... I suggest rare because it is still cooking as it's brought to the table. I got the medium rare which was still tasty. Don't forget to drench the signature steak sauce onto it! Our bill ended up to be -$172 before tip. I'll definitely return after I take a few months to unclog my arteries. I can't wait to do it all over again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'll always love it here for their dry aged porterhouse, but we were truly disappointed this time around. Our charbroiled crust of steak was just very charred that it made most of our meat too burnt to enjoy and ruined the taste for us.

Sofiya H.,/user_details?userid=ykW7VPj3DCccPONOhks2IA,"Chicago, IL",2/9/2020,3.0,"I would like to preface this with the fact that my favorite type of steak is a CHICAGO steak lathered in garlic, butter, salt and pepper. I have heard so many good things about Peter Lugar and have been wanting to try it ever since. We got there and it was BUSY! It had a nice vibrant environment that is really enjoyable. We got seated 15 minutes after our reservation time and once we got seated, the chairs were not comfortable. Our bread basket arrived and I noticed that it didn't have the same type of bread as everyone; there was three different styles in everyone's and we only got two. I had to ask to get the same type of basket as everyone which shouldn't be the case. Also the butter was cold and hard to spread! My husband asked for sparkling water and they brought him club soda. We asked if they had sparkling water and they brought out pelligrino which was what we had originally asked for. The steak was great, well prepared. We got the steak for two which was more than enough. It could have used a little bit more seasoning but the steak itself was good, maybe even great but just needed a little bit more salt. The Peter lugar potatoes were amazing and would highly recommend. It's a good steakhouse but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The vibe at PL is definitely cool - dark woods, white cloth tables and the manliest and sternest waiters serving thick porterhouse chops. The first time I went, the steak was fine - sufficiently tender, the bacon was lovely and thick and the sides were good. However, subsequent visits, the steaks were overcooked, chewy, underseasoned and disappointing, especially given the price. Since then, we've long discovered Wolfgang's - opened by a Peter Luger alum, that has the exact same offering, but much more consistent steak.

I've probably been back four times or so since, and I can't get enough. Hands down the best steakhouse. If you're expecting a very fancy vibe when you come in you won't get it. Looks like a German beer hall inside. Don't get the cocktails they're not very good. Stick to wine. Cash or debit only. Have to make a reservation month or 2 ahead of time to get in for dinner. Even with reservation you'll have to wait 30 min or so. Still worth the trouble. A little better with a group since so much food but great for two too. Get the tomato/onion, bacon (even if you don't love bacon (I don't) this one is next level and unique), porterhouse steak, german potatoes, and creamed spinach.

Nope, still my number one steak in the US and my number two in the world (#1 goes to Bar Nestor in San SebastiÃ¡n) and that's up against hundreds of steaks in a lifetime so far. We returned this week for about the 10th time since my last review and it was as good as the first time. I would say the waiters have gotten friendlier over the years tho. Not that they were bad before, just more charmingly gruff. We've had a lot more of the dishes over the years too, but my favorites are still the same: steak for two or three, the bread with butter and their sauce, the spinach, and absolutely the bacon.

Salad looked worse than street food. Bacon was way too fat. The steak was burned and black (we ordered medium well). And it tasted so dry and hard. It is not worth your money.

Peter Luger Steakhouse, while having the perfect atmosphere where I feel perfectly at home, manages to give me the best piece of cow consistently. It's atmosphere makes me feel welcomed, at home, and comfortable. Second, service. I've read a lot of reviews saying their service has their signature rudeness or whatever. I actually don't know what the hell they are talking about or what kind of entitled pricks they must be to feel that way. The service is not too in-your-face. They let you enjoy your meal, your conversations, and your moments. But they are always there to help, or fill up your water cup or whatever your beverage of choice might be.

Came w total 4 people and ordered porterhouse for 3 w couple sides. Thank goodness we didn't order for 4. We were stuffed! We got the steak cooked between rare and Med rare but came out rare. The steak sauce is too sweet imo. Good steak but thought it would be more flavorful and softer. Some parts were soft but most was little chewy (bc cooked rare maybe?) for $280 for 4 people I think it's slightly overpriced but def w good experience. Good service just wished the steak was more soft or more flavorful.

When I finally got my chance to get to New York I had to try it. Â Get reservations a month in advance. This Brooklyn piece of heaven was all it was cracked up to be. We ordered the tomato and onions with bacon and covered them in the house steak sauce. Â The porter house for four was our meat choice. Melted in your mouth and you could cut it with your fork. Â German potatoes with the whole thing. Perfect in every way. The waiters were lifers and very blunt and to the point which only added to the experience. Â Bring cash because it's cash only and don't forget the apple strudel Â with house whipped cream. Â It's to die for.

J A.,/user_details?userid=lvGlIBv4xkHiQBnNOuRYZQ,"Orange County, CA",3/8/2020,4.0,dined solo at the bar. got there about 30 mins before they opened and there was a decent line. most are waiting for a table so you can skip the line and get to the bar. ribeye was good steak. nothing crazy.....but good. bacon was pretty ridiculous and the creamed spinach was also great. kinda wish i tried a burger. service is obviously old school. when you sit at the bar you have a tab with the bartender for your drinks and then a server comes around for food orders and you have a separate tab with them. kinda weird but it all works. glad that i went but unless im coming for a burger at the bar i probably don't need to come back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Â It does feel like you go back in time when you enter and that is because of the combination of the decorvsndvfriendly wait staff and host. Â I ordered the steak for 2 with a side of brocolli. Â You start of with bread per usual, pretzel, onion, and typical bread sticks. Â I would have prefered if they were served warm but whatever. Â As for the steak, it was tender enough to be sliced with your fork. Â Flavor wise, it was inconsistent but maybe it was because of its size. Â Some pieces, it was served sliced, were more flavorful then others but still good balance of salt and butter. Â My one complaint on the steak was that it was charred from the searing process so some parts of it tasted overly burned.

Sean W.,/user_details?userid=B4S7n_hZzv33lP44Sulg1A,"La Habra, CA",5/26/2017,5.0,"What can I say, Peter Luger did not disappoint. Â This was definitely worth the trip from Midtown and the 9:45pm Monday reservation (only available). Â I was a party of 1, but thankful I got in during my short visit to the City. Â Walking into Peter Luger, the first thing I noticed was the big crowd. Â The bar inside to the left has an old school German feel and big decorative steins to boot. Â I came with a crisp Benjamin in my pocket, so I did not have one of the half dozen beers or so on draft or any spirits or wine. Â This trip was all about the food. Â Once I sat down, I was greeted by one of their infamous servers. Â When I told my server I was doing well, he replied that he was feeling more medium rare. Â Points for cheesy steak humor. Â The first thing to arrive was the bread basket and a large vat of steak sauce. Â The bread was delicious and I ate the whole basket. Â Rookie mistake on my part. Â Then came the bacon. Â I was told by a friend I had to try the bacon and I'm glad I did. Â It was an exceptionally thick, smoky, flavorful slab of bacon. Â Went nicely with the steak sauce. Â For my entrÃ©e, I went with the rib steak and a side of the German potatoes. Â After a twenty minute wait or so, she arrived in all her glory. Â The steak was huge. Â Bone-in, easily tipped the scales over a pound and a half. Â First cut, right away I could tell the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. Â What I appreciate about Peter Luger is the fact that they let the beef shine on its own. Â No fancy truffle shavings, bÃ©arnaise sauce, mushrooms or any of that. Â Just pure beef. Â The steak was very juicy and had a nice buttery flavor. Â The fat was well marbled and really melted in your mouth. Â As good as the steak sauce tastes, it was going nowhere near my steak. Â It was a really quality cut of beef. Â I ate the whole thing. Â I wasn't going to let any go to waste. Â The server was impressed by my knife skills and the fact that I ate a basket of bread, a slab of bacon, half a side of German potatoes (which are very good), and a huge steak down to the bone. Â He rewarded me with two gold Peter Luger (chocolate) coins for my accomplishment. Â My meal came in around $80, so my hundred dollar bill covered my food, tip, and subway fare back to Midtown.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friend and I made a reservation about a month in advance and were counting down the days. Unfortunately it was extremely underwhelming to me. My friend had a few recommendations on special dishes to try and I was really not thrilled with any of them. The tomatoes for an appetizer was literally 5 thick slices of a tomato with sauce on the side to drizzle it on. The sauce tasted like cocktail sauce to me and was in no way memorable. Then we got burgers with cheese and bacon. I kept getting pieces of grizzle in the burger- definitely turned me off. I know PL is famous for their bacon, but being all fatty I was not a fan. Maybe if it was crispy on the outside, but it was not. Then we got the German potatoes and those tasted just like homefries (breakfast-y) to me. The real kicker was they charged us a $5 splitting fee even though we ordered 3 things to share. I can see it if we only ordered 1 dish, but we ordered 3 and spent $85 still for 1 burger, 1 app and a side. I won't be in a rush to come back anytime soon for their steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I can't say much about the parking cause we Uber here. We ordered a lot of food. We ordered the steak for four an 2 orders of the Rib steak. Two orders of Spinach an potatoes with a side order of Lamb shops, Amazing. At the end of our eat it was too much food even for 6 of us. This place is good for family outing especially if they coming from out of town. This has to be a must go spot when visiting NYC. Last but not least it's very important to know that they don't take credit cards: Cash only.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

L W.,/user_details?userid=4SQcgKAPYV9RUWdzNO8D8g,"Windham, NH",5/31/2019,5.0,"I'd always watched these shows about the top steakhouses in America/world on food network and travel channel, and Peter Luger has ALWAYS been on those lists. Needless to say I was excited to try what is considered by many to be some of the best of the best. Peter Lugers is a NY institution that's well over 100 years old so it goes without saying that it's consistently done more right than it has wrong, and if I could sum up my experience there I think that's how I would phrase it, ""more right than wrong"". We came in almost an hour ahead of schedule and the staff had us sit by the bar for a bit. Now obviously this is NYC so a beer is at least $10 almost everywhere just like in a large portion of Boston's inner city joints, the difference is in Boston you are paying $10 to drink in a city with more than one successful sports team....had to. Anyway despite how earlier we were the staff managed to get us seated incredibly fast which was unexpected given how busy they are, so we were very thankful. We ordered two single strips and one prime rib special. Before we got our entrees our excellent waiter brought us some bread/butter and house made steak sauce. The bread was excellent but it was not warm....all the same we ate two baskets of it so whatever I'm not much of a complainer I guess. When our steaks arrived they were all cooked perfectly and paired well with the house steak sauce. Now I must admit I am not generally a fan of the strip cut of beef because I feel as though it's rarely executed properly, and I ordered it simply because it was advantageous with the way they structure their menu. I can compliment the chefs enough on their work because they really impressed me and it was easily the best strip steak I've ever had. Because Peter Luger is such a storied resturant I will not knock it for having a simple menu but I won't say I wasn't hoping for more options. Overall an excellent experience and I'd love to go again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Danielle S.,/user_details?userid=G2ZFsgEm2mhPH1pvw3Jgag,"New York, NY",1/21/2019,5.0,"I was so excited to dine at this restaurant since it's been around since the late 1800's! Very rare to say the least. I came her on a Sunday afternoon on a date and thankfully he knew someone to be seated right away for our reservation. If you do not have a reservation- expect a long wait. We started off with the Caesar salad and bacon. The Caesar salad was everything you could expect for a Caesar, nothing special however very good. The bacon was insane! Literally, cutting into the bacon was simply so succulent and more of a steak bacon. It was that good. After, we each shared the lamb appetizer. It was so delicious and not that seasoned which was great because you want to taste the meat, especially if it's a good cut. My date and I split the cheeseburger after which was out of this world! I'm a huge burger lover, and this restaurant blows every burger I ever had out of the ballpark. The bun is more of a brioche style, the burger has dry aged meat that's grounded within which takes the taste to the next level. Last but not least we both split the Â porterhouse steak . The filet mignon and NY strip of the porterhouse was dry aged perfectly. I had such an amazing time . The ambiance was more of an old school feel with tourists and people from the neighborhood dining. The desert was delicious the chocolate moose was delicately whipped on top of an Oreo cookie crust. Well done. I highly recommend for lunch on a Sunday. P.S. the burger is only available for lunch until 4 p.m. Plan accordingly !",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I am not into meat that much so my review is obviously a little bias . I went twice over the years and both time after a couple of bites of my stake I ended up just eating creamed spinach . This is a review I should have posted last year but forgot . I've had much better meat in Manhattan at a lower price .

I noticed all the good reviews were from years ago and all the bad ones are more recently, which adds to my opinion that this establishment is going downhill. Another thing I don't like is telling your waitress how much you are going to tip them, because I noticed some waitresses making faces at another table. I never guess someone's financial situation but it seemed that they were in a tough spot so shame on them for making faces. If anyone is wondering when this story took place, it was right before it closed to the virus. Overall, wouldn't really recommend to anyone unless they have a really good tolerance level.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Grace A.,/user_details?userid=iihU8qJD7fhdI-D9cF-PsQ,"Queens, NY",2/15/2019,5.0,"I had always loved Peter Luger the first time I ate here was because we just wanted to taste the steak in this world famous steakhouse. Me and my husband celebrated our valentines date here, highly recommend anyone to call for reservation. Peter Luger is a popular restaurant and there can be long lines without reservation you might wait to get seated. Service was great as usual they served us bread first as a free appetizer. We ordered the steak for 2 and side dish onion rings. The side dish itself is good for 2 people, before we made a mistake and ordered 2 side dishes. Creamy spinach and onion rings, we had a difficult time finishing the two meal, although they said creamy spinach is their highlight dish i find nothing too special with it. Creamy spinach was delicious of course but it was just too hyped up. Anyway the steak was amazing- tender, juicy, delicious. After the main course we ordered the Holy Cow sundae it was so good. Size is good for sharing but for people who love chocolates like me 2 order is a must!

The price is like every other steakhouse you go too so we weren't too worried about the price at all. Our server (forgot his name) was extremely attentive and very nice and entertaining, it made our dinner ten times better, he also explained what we should pair the meats with and the thick cut bacon with the gravy, and it was legit out of this world.

I started off the bacon which was incredibly flavourful and practically melted in my mouth.

Although there were complaints about the service recently, I found it to be very satisfactory and accommodating.

I thought that going on a weekday soon after Lent would make for an easier experience. There was a 30 minute wait until a bar spot opened up. I had spent time in the very loud waiting area behind the bar with some guy conversing loudly into my ear in Japanese. Â You don't need to make lunch reservations at most places for a table but here you do. The bartender doesn't take lunch orders but I was helped by a waiter. There's no music or televisions. I ordered the Luger Burger with fries. It was basically a naked sandwich that's gone in a few bites. The steak fries are also plain. It's a fine lunch but not worth the cash, wait or the chaos.

I stopped by about 10 days prior to see how it was set up and on the corner of Driggs Avenue and Broadway there was a table that had barriers around it and a great heat lamp above it. It was about 45Â° that day. I asked the people on how it was eating outside and they said with the heat lamp it was not that bad. On the night I ate there I was very surprised that all the tables didn't have the great heat lamps and the heat lamp over my table you could barely feel anything. None of us were dressed properly because I told them about the great heat lamps and that they would not need a heavy heavy jacket. The food was great and so was the service but we basically gobbled down our food because we were all so cold.

Nadia M.,/user_details?userid=hgHWYt3HwGOxtd3b63T78Q,"Brooklyn, NY",12/2/2016,5.0,"So, I am definitely considered a carnivore. Â I love meat. I don't eat meat everyday, but it always calls me to come back to the red meat side. I've been to Peter Lugers on 2 separate occasions and have always fell in to a meat coma after indulging in the red zone. I would consider this place a man's place. Men from all walks of life ready to indulge in a hearty caveman dinner. My family and I decided to head out on a Tuesday to eat here. As soon as you walk in there is the smell of sizzling beef in the air. So my salivary glands are working in overdrive and I have to hiss back the saliva to prevent from dribbling. Our waiter Ivan,as all the rest, were very accommodating and you can tell there is a team spirit. The table bread came out prepared 3 different ways. I remember the onion which had onion bits on the in/outside. It was very good. I wanted another piece but made sure to keep room for the meat. For appetizers we had the slice of bacon and shrimp cocktail. Â The bacon was so rich with just enough fat crisped up from cooking. It was divine. When added with the house steak sauce it was mind blowing. I could have had 2 bacon slices and the shrimp and called it a night. However, give me the meat. The shrimp were huge and extremely filling, and a little on the tough side. I ordered my steak prepared medium. And may I say when I saw my plate come out sizzling in its juices with that steak aroma I was ready to dig in. All I can say is that it was great. The pieces of filet mignon taste like butter melting in my mouth. The steak was addicting. My mind kept craving for more while my stomach was begging me to stop. Let's just say my stomach won. I paired my steak with fries and cream spinach. The fries were a bit over done but still good down to the last potato. The spinach gets a thumbs up, not soupy or too creamy. My mom ordered the filet of sole. She wasn't impressed. She claimed the batter was soft and tasteless. I guess they put there hard work into the steak. And just to end the night with something sweet make sure you try the home-made schlag or whip cream. Very rich in flavor. I would absolutely recommend this place to my fellow carnivores and advice them to keep an open stomach. I know it's corny, but it's the truth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's a great place to take someone to celebrate. This time I took my youngest son to celebrate his 18th Birthday. Everything was perfect but then again it should be, they've been doing for 130 years.I started off with a glass of Laphroiag 10 Single Malt Scotch. Nothing goes better with steak then a good single malt. We ordered two steak for two's because one of my kids likes his steak medium well. (Crazy!) One was Medium/Medium Rare and the other was Medium/Medium Well. Like I said, they were perfect. There are a few staples I feel you have to get if you eat at Peter Luger's so we did. They are the Sliced Tomatoes & Onions, With Luger's Own Sauce, Luger's Sizzling Bacon, Extra Thick, Luger's Special German Fried Potatoes, and Creamed Spinach. Believe it or not but after all of that food we made room for dessert. They make an excellent Ice Cream Sundae topped with Homemade Schlag (Really good whipped cream).

We ordered the bacon as an appetizer and it was the BEST part of our night! Add a little Special Peter Luger steak sauce on it and top it with some bread and that experience was memorable. Our main entree was the T-Bone steak cooked medium well (I would do medium next time) and the side of special potatoes. The plate came sizzling out with the juices of the steak poured over it! Uber yummy - I really enjoyed the steak since it was a great example of medium well cooked perfectly - as you cut into the steak it becomes redder and that was perfect. The Special Potatoes were just that - Special and seasoned to perfection! One last thing - we were celebrating my birthday and they brought out a Big bowl of whip cream with a candle which was cute but funny. I just knew there was a brownie or a cheesecake under all the whip cream, but it wasn't besides the Gold coins on the side.

Alan K.,/user_details?userid=LvM0r_NXfNyOU3P6w54Nrg,"Vaughan, Canada",10/12/2018,4.0,"Simply steaks done right. They are cooked perfectly medium rare is medium rare. This place is hard to get reservations and if you end up getting one it is most likely early or late in the evening. If you have a choice and are on a vacation I would recommend an earlier sitting. Once the 6pm rush begins the reception area is FILLED with guests. The steaks are all USDA prime and you have an option of a rib eye, single, two, or three person steak. I went with the Rib Eye and shared it with the wife; the steak was more than enough for us. There was no way we could have finished the steak for two. We also had a side of vegetables to go with it. From the presentation to the service everything was what we came to expect from a classic steak house. The steak was tender and juicy, it arrives pre-cut and the waiter serves you splices of meat along with their special steak sauce. While the steak sauce was good I would still prefer A1 or HP but thats just my opinion. Not sure what others complaints are but this isnt supposed to be a hip steakhouse. The pricing was great due to the portion size of the food, as others have said one appetizer is more than enough for 2-3 people. Dont be afraid to share as everyone is doing the same and the waiters even suggest that. Those having issues waiting maybe should have called ahead and made a reservation; a good tip is to call between 3pm or 6pm and I made my reservation 2 weeks in advance. Last thing they are CASH ONLY and do not accept credit to me thats where they lost points. All in all good steaks and comfortable classic atmosphere.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We were not sure what to expect given some recent media coverage but we left extremely satisfied and very glad we went. The server was attentive and very helpful. The cocktails were classic steakhouse staples. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were just as tasty. The whole table also loved the bacon and the pecan pie!

Nidhin K.,/user_details?userid=RGC7eDfsrZZEgSqvzd9jeA,"Albany, NY",5/26/2019,5.0,"Went there yesterday with my cousin and cousin in law. It was all of our first times dining at Peter Lugers. Always been hearing amazing things about this place and we finally got a chance to check it out. Made the reservation online a month ago. It was for a Sunday afternoon at 3:45. Got there at 3:40 and checked in with the gentleman in the front, who was very friendly and organized and took the time to learn the correct pronunciation of my name lmao he then told us to hang out by the bar and that he'd call my name when they're ready to seat us. It was dumb hot outside like 88 degrees and extra sunny. While we waited we ordered 3 ice cold Brooklyn lagers and by the time we were halfway done with our beers our table was ready. We were led upstairs beer in hand to a nice room and sat at a 4 person table. Our server was very friendly and straight to the point. We ordered two slices of bacon, steak for 3 cooked medium rare, creamed spinach, and German fried potatoes. We asked our server if that was enough food for the 3 of us and he said yes that's perfect. There was bread on the table, and their signature steak sauce. The bread was good but nothing crazy. Tried it with the sauce, and the sauce is good, also nothing too crazy, it kinda tastes like ketchup with a little bit more tang. Our server brought out the bacon and even though we ordered 2 slices he brought out 3, 1 for each of us, and told us not to worry about it, which was really nice of him. Bacon was delicious.....It's hard to put into words what the bacon was like. If you are a fan of bacon, then this will make you very, very happy. The king of all bacon. The steak came out along with the German potatoes and creamed spinach. Steak was spectacular. Best steak I've ever had in my life no cap. First time ever eating a dry aged steak. Creamed spinach and the potatoes were also delicious. One of the other servers chatted with us for a little bit. We ate everything and left no leftovers. We were more than satisfied by the end. Perfect amount for the 3 of us. We also got another round of Brooklyn Lagers and ordered 1 slice of chocolate cake. They brought chocolate coins and their special whipped cream as well. Cake wasn't too special but it was just right, a little something sweet after that amazing meal. Whipped cream was fire. Overall, I can't even lie this was a 10/10 experience. I don't think there is one thing I'd change to make our meal better. We were there for the steak and it blew our mind. The bacon and spinach just brought it over the top. The service was very professional and kind. Everyone must've just been in a happy mood that day. My expectations were very high and this meal blew right past them. Definitely nice place to go to once in a while. If you're down to spend $100 a person for a nice steak dinner once in a while for a special occasion or whatever, this is the place. Definitely a great place to bring a lady especially if she likes steak as much as you. But not just any lady she's gotta be wifey. We'll be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Shafiq R.,/user_details?userid=tPGGypee2HjoPVBkGZAZIA,"Mansfield, TX",3/16/2021,5.0,"I believe that salt and pepper is sufficient for a good cut of meat. I don't like any sauce on my steak, because sauce hides the real characteristics of the steak. You want to taste the succulent beef without tampering with its flavor, like Bistecca alla Fiorentina. However, on the east coast and in most of the chain steakhouses, they smother the steak with butter, garlic, thyme, rosemary, and some prefer steak sauce. In Texas, people believe that it is a sin to add anything to the meat except salt and pepper. I've been eating steak all over the world and I can proudly say that Texas offers some of the best steaks in the world. Let's cut to the chase with Peter Luger. After reading the negative reviews from the New York Times, I was skeptical, but since I was traveling in NYC and I was willing to take a risk and take a shot with this 100+ year old establishment. During COVID, NYC is struggling, and Peter Luger is no exception. Despite all those hurdles, their service was above par and their steak was really good, although the butter overpowered the beef flavor. Their fries were good too and the price was reasonable. I can say that it is one of the good steakhouses in NYC with historical characteristics.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Walking around freely without masks in and out of the restaurant and to bathrooms etc. Asked the waiter to talk to them. He did and management did but the group argued and didn't comply. They were allowed to stay screaming, yelling, laughing, walking around not wearing masks. Peter Luger doesn't seem to understand the concept of open windows or a strong hvac system either. Air was sticky and hot, no fresh air at all. Me and my fiance felt very unsafe and we have been to many indoor restaurants but Peter Luger has been the worst experience. The food was alright. Bacon is phenomal and so was the dessert (cheesecake and schlag) but the steak was mediocre at best. We had the steak for two and it was tasteless. I make better steaks at home.

Kat K.,/user_details?userid=NT-xnCvGxYft3J4nWw_9Uw,"Brooklyn, NY",1/4/2019,3.0,My family loves spending special occasions at Peter Luger's. We usually go to the Long Island location but its significantly further than this one. We decided to give it a shot. So I call to make a reservation for a Friday lunch (their burgers rock!) and I'm told that we don't need a reservation. I found that odd because we always made reservations because we know they get very busy. So I decided to call back the next day and again I was told no reservation needed. Who am I to question them? So we arrive Friday 1pm to be told we needed a reservation! We had no choice but to leave and go someplace else to eat. It was so disappointing.

Daniel E.,/user_details?userid=_H6kpp01jNpjv5p5ptgiNQ,"Long Beach, CA",7/22/2019,1.0,"This place is actually awful. And you would never know from all the awards they probably bought for themselves. From making a reservation to the waitstaff to the drinks. Bad. We actually were able to get a same day reservation and I know now why. We showed up 5 minutes early to our reservation and still had to wait about 20 minutes which I don't really have a problem with but I want this review to be honest and the whole story. We sat down and ordered our drinks. We ordered a steak for two, lamb chops, salmon, fries and 3 sides and 4 drinks also a shrimp cocktail. The shrimp cocktail was actually the best tasting thing we ordered ( hard to undercook shrimp) but whatever. We ordered both of the meats medium rare. They brought the steak out first. The steak arrived to the table grey. The waiter said that it had cooked on the hot plate on the way from the kitchen....... ......... ........ we were underwhelmed to say the least he then with tongs brought us 4 pieces of rare steak from the kitchen and threw them on top of the well done one that was not good and said here are some rare ones on the house. Then the lamb came out shortly after also grey. The steak was edible but DEF not the best steak I have ever had. Probably one of the worst I think I have had a better one at an Applebee's in the mid west. The lamb tho was awful. I feel so bad that poor lamb had to be killed just for the meat to be severely over cooked at this point we told the waiter this was not good and very well done he said it also cooked on the hot plate they served it on and that we didn't eat it fast enough. The waiter got the manager who said the same thing that had we eaten faster the lamb would have been better. It took everything inside me not to leap across the table and make him eat the lamb himself. He then asked ""well what do you want me to do about it"" we were all a little shocked by this question and before we could answer he offered to take the lamb off the check. That seemed fair since I wouldn't even feed that lamb meat to my dog. The waiter then poured water in one of our Vodka tonics to refill it. A simple mistake but when we asked him to replace it. He asked if we were tourists as if we were trying to get free things. It was very disrespectful. I actually do live in NYC and have for awhile and eaten at many restaurants I have never paid a bill over 400$and was treated this way. That was def a first. All and all it was a very bad experience. I don't know if anyone will read this but felt I needed to say something. That restaurant has been there forever and maybe it's under new management. I would go anywhere else before going back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Michele P.,/user_details?userid=BbVNuyteQxiST31fe1gfTA,"San Jose, CA",9/22/2017,5.0,"A friend was in town and made a reservation 2 months in advance. I'd highly recommend it cause it's quite a popular place. We had a reservation for Sunday lunch and when we got there a few minutes before opening, there were 2 lines already formed, one for those with reservations and one for those without. With our reservation, we were seated right away. We had 2 servers through our meal and both were hilarious. They cracked jokes with us throughout the meal and were a lot of fun. Food was excellent. Get at least a slice of the thick cut bacon. I put some in between the bread for a tasty bacon sandwich and dipped it into the sauce they give you on the side. Bacon and bread, so tasty. Between 4 people we shared the steak for 2 and a burger and a side of fries, German potatoes, and creamed spinach. It was definitely plenty of food for 4 of us and left us with room for dessert. The best part of the meal has got to be the steak that is sitting in a tiny pool of butter. The meat was tender, juicy, and buttery. It has me wishing for more as I'm writing this review. Everyone else loved the burger, and while it is a good deal, the steak is the way to go. The sundae to end the meal was good but nothing too special. Seriously, go and get a steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Darryl D.,/user_details?userid=HRZQRHYFSNAgy8SJlyeCLQ,"Chicago, IL",4/22/2018,5.0,"Made a reservation the day of for lunch on a weekday and was easily accommodated, so absolutely no complains there. The ambiance had a cool old-school German grandparent's house kind of vibe, not that I'd have any idea how that'd feel (I'm Filipino). My group of 3, consisting of 2 omnivores and 1 vegan, ordered the ""Steak for Two"" and a slice of bacon. The steak was skillfully cooked, so rich and buttery, and everything you could ask for in a plain, good 'ol steak. It wasn't the best piece of steak I ever had, but it was damn good, as was the bacon. Every bite melted in your mouth Â and you appreciate the care and expertise put into serving quality meat on your plate. Overall, I can't give this establishment anything less than 5 stars, because they're just simply great at what they do. My only quirk is that we had to pay an extra $10 for the vegan just sitting there. I'm guessing they added that extra charge because they were expecting the ""Steak for Two"" to be split by three. Nonetheless, the food and service was awesome enough to overshadow the fact that our vegan friend was charged $10 to breathe the filet mignon marinated air. Definitely would come back, just vegan-less.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Tried going here twice. So strike 3 already and Peter Luger is out. I'll get my burger or steak elsewhere. A steakhouse that only takes cash???? It's 2018, get with the program. With your prices, you can't afford the small fee to allow people to use a card but instead you charge over $4 to use your ATM outside the restaurant!

Luckily enough while in NY we had time to hop an Uber over to Brooklyn. As we walked in we were greeted with a nice welcome to Peter Lugers. This steakhouse is awesome. So humble in looks so amazing in service and food. We were served a yummy basket a variety of bread. We ordered the bacon appetizer. The sauce was brought out. We then 44oz Porterhouse and amazing doesn't begin to describe it. When served rare as we ordered, it was set on an upside down plate so the juices and drippings gathered at the end of the plate. The waiter placed a piece of sirloin on each plate and then two pieces of fillet. He then took a large spoon and dripped the juices from the other plate on top of the meat. This was a super great dinner, now time for New York Cheesecake for dessert. Everything was great and very very tasty.

Marlaine E.,/user_details?userid=2M5wsy6dVHJgKmXvtOrvmQ,"Brooklyn, NY",8/8/2018,5.0,"Steak lovers rejoice. My brother and I were lucky to get squeezed in a dinner reservation by Amex Platinum Concierge with a day's notice. We ordered the Peter Luger bacon, porterhouse for two, creamed spinach, and cheesecake. No matter how much you think the porterhouse will fill you, order the bacon because it's one-of-a-kind, mouthwatering amazingness. To put it in perspective, I usually steer away from pork because ""pigs are empathetic"" but, holy crap(!), so worth shattering my moral foundation. Now to the porterhouse. Served on a center plate, the waiter places pieces on our plates and drizzles some excess fat from the plate over our slices. The filet section tasted like foie gras...we both agreed. If you want to ensure your arteries clog, the cheesecake is a solid choice; it's rich and comes with a plate full of homemade whipped cream. Next time, I'll dip into the alcoholic beverage selection.

Matt O.,/user_details?userid=K9koQ4jDrFRuwYqHUlzUDQ,"Royal Oak, MI",1/21/2017,5.0,"Visiting NYC from Detroit, MI and heard that Peter Luger Steak House was the place to check out of you wanted the best steak in the city. I was not disappointed. This was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten!! We started with the Caesar salad which was delicious. Then we each had a slice of bacon- must try!!! The bacon was the best bacon I have ever tried, it melts in your mouth. Next was the porterhouse for 2. It was everything I hoped for and then some. The presentation and flavor of the meat were both top notch. You get the best of both worlds with the filet on one side and the sirloin on the other. You might be full at this point, but the meal isn't over just yet. You must try a dessert. I tried the cheesecake with ""Schlag"" or their in house whipped cream. It was a perfect ending to the meal. Overall I was extremely impressed with the food and service and I will be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The dry aged porterhouse for two we ordered was surprisingly flavorless (*gasp* blasphemy!), over-charred, unevenly cooked, and overpriced with a very small filet. I thought we got ""lucky"", but while cooking was inconsistent across the 3 tables of couples next to us (ordered with the same medium-rare doneness), filets were similarly sized. The fame alone will probably distort reality for many visitors.

The creamed spinach and fried potatoes were incredibly delicious as well. We also ordered the steak for two. This place definitely knows what they are doing when it comes to steak. Maybe it has something to do with the fact they've been in business for 125 years.

Once we were seated upstairs, our waiter, which he never introduced himself appropriately so I don't know his name was also very dry and seemed like he hated his job. They had no options for kids and not a big selection on the menu, but we were recommended the steak for two which we ordered along with a baked potato and Cesar salad. We ordered our filet medium and it came rare, the bake potato cake with a huge bowl of sour cream and no other sides not even butter! The waiter checked on our table maybe twice. Our water was always empty and the service was horrible to say the least. Now, what put the icing on the cake, i was told after dinner, my husband mentioned to the host to do something special since it was my birthday... do you think anything was done? Of course not.

K L.,/user_details?userid=NJR6PWj8pprmIaahOBTtJw,"Springville, NY",10/11/2018,3.0,The hype was real before arriving seeing thousands of rave reviews. Made reservations 3 months in advance which took FOREVER to get through the phone line. We were a bit disappointed with the food though. Steak is really great quality but doesn't have a lot of seasoning or flavor. Staff isn't the friendliest and ended up sitting next to a group of about 20 men who were loud and obnoxious. Hard to decipher whether Buffalo food spoils us or the food was mediocre. Either way we won't be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My husband doesn't eat red meat (tragic, I know) and I knew I would not (should not) be able to tackle the ""steak for 2"", so I enlisted my quasi-veterinarian sister to assist, lol. We grabbed a pre-dinner cocktail at the bar (scotch for the ladies, beer for the hubs), as we were a few min early. A few min later we were led up a staircase then to the back of the room where our table was already furnished with their delicious steak sauce (that I wanted to put on everything) and menus. Onion rolls soon followed and didn't have a chance, so good. We went simple, green salad with Russian dressing (when in Rome), tomato and onion side for the fresh crunch, steak for 2 medium rare, salmon (for the hubs), and creamed spinach fort the table. The steak is so good it's criminal! After my first bite I started to think we should have gone with steak for 3 despite there only being on real meat eater (me). Everything complimented each other perfectly. Even my husband's salmon was to die for. We closed it out with a little fernet for digestion. I'm literally planning my next trip later this year.

Great steaks, great sides, great atmosphere, great service and it's a historical landmark as one of the oldest continuously operated restaurants in the city (since the late 1800's). Â The only reason I give it 4 stars is because they do not take credit card; either cash (let's be real most people born after 1980 don't walk around with wads of cash in their pockets) or you can sign up for their own charge card (I assume to avoid banking fees and make more money). That and the fact that the service is very rushed (The food is basically thrown on the table and taken away before you take your 5th bite) so be prepared as a table for two to spend less than an hour there.

Having visited this place since I was kid, I like the fact that nothing changed much. The food, interior, certain waiters, coin chocolates, and even the long wait despite making a reservation are just about the same. The must-order items on the menu are 2 caesar salads, shrimp cocktail, bacon (top it with their steak sauce), and cheesecake or holy cow. Of course, the steak is not to be forgotten; the porterhouse for 2 is our choice for a group of up to 4. I'd advise to avoid getting the porterhouse for 2 to split between 2 people unless you've starved for a couple days or not ordering anything but the steak. Â I go for one of their draft beers most of the time and have tried the lunchtime burger to my disappointment. But I do suggest going there when the doors open (11:45am if I'm not mistaken?) to wait the least amount of time for your reservation. I like the cool mannerism of the waiters but also wonder why I haven't seen any waitresses.

Jason T.,/user_details?userid=X8x9iXcPH1oo0qYXdnnoeg,"New York, NY",8/18/2017,3.0,"I love this place. The thrill of waiting for your table. The smoke permeating in the air. The fact that everyone around you is paying good money for this experience. The MEAT! I've now experienced my 3rd visit to Peter Luger's and well, it was good and sour. In my heart this place is a solid 4, but it was a 3 star enterprise today. Arrived at PL at around at 1:48 pm. I got 2 friends to join me for their luncheon special as I'd been longing for it since forever. It's a cheaper way to get to their food and there are daily specials. We were given a quote time of 30-45 min. We were sat in half hour. Painless. Table just about in the middle of the room. Stoic servers walking all around me. Our stoic server was about the business. No smile. No thank you. No eye contact. A Sprite, Coke, and Ginger Ale all in seemingly 8 oz. bottles with a small glass starved of ice. We settled to start with the onion rings and finish with 2 well-done(I know, shoot us!) bacon cheeseburgers and a chopped steak medium well. The burgers came with semi-medium cut fries and slice of raw onion. The steak came with a side of caramelized onions and mash. But before we move on, something happened prior to our food arriving. My friend was approached by a man who was chewing food and asked if he had a jacket or long-sleeved shirt. Of course he didn't. He came as is, a hooded cut off shirt whilst exposing some tatooes. Welcome to Brooklyn. Even now I don't know if it was the shirt, the tatooes or both. I do get the fact that we were at a steakhouse and that there's an underlying dress code but as I stated to the whoever, this should have all been taken cared of before we got to the table. He told us that this is not a lecture and it better not have been as he was talking to grown, professionals who entered a steakhouse not a schoolhouse! The individual came back to the table with a blue long sleeved collared shirt and placed it behind my friend's chair. It was thankfully only a option. So, my burger was fabulous. Juicy, flavorful, plentiful, simple, tasty and I didn't want it to end. The BACON and the BEEF were fighting to be the star of the show. Although the burger was well done, I squeezed it a few times and the juices were seering out. The bacon was so thick and salty and added so much to the burger or alone. The fries were a nice touch. Our onion rings came first though. A sharable bed of lightly breaded edible circular ribbons. Greasy but great start. My other friend mentioned that her chopped steak was alright. It did look like a chopped up burger. Nothing was said more than that. We were offered dessert but in so many ways we had had our fill. I will never rule out PL. Actually, I can't wait to go again! And to whomever I may invite to join me, I might have to mention our ""cover-up"" story beforehand.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However, when we went there, the staff said our name is not on the list and gave me a bad attitude and even didn't apologize. They pretty much ruined our birthday meals and we didn't get a apology we deserved. I understand sometimes ppl messed up the reservation. However, instead of apologizing, they gave us a bad attitude and asked us to wait by the bar and even didn't take down my full name and my phone number. We ended up leaving.

Maybe this suits others preference. The price doesn't match the quality. None of the sides were overly impressive. The key lime pie was pretty tasty. I'd do that again for sure.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The first problem is their attitude. The employee was not in the attitude of confirming my reservation. Another male employee urged me to make a quick decision. If I wanted to wait, I had to wait an hour. We needed time to discuss this situation , and asked for a moment to wait. I decided to wait an hour and told them. But They said I can't book any more.

Usually places I see on TV never live up to the expectations that I've built up in my head, but Peter Luger's did. The steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and did not need sauce. Speaking of the sauce, it was also amazing (an excellent blend of tangy and sweet) and went perfectly with the onion rings. The German fried potatoes were another great side.

Danny C.,/user_details?userid=jVaiCNmWOjoI0led5LZuyA,"South San Francisco, CA",9/10/2017,4.0,"Peter Luger has won best steakhouse in New York for almost three decades running now, and I don't think they're going to let up any time soon. When the steak of your dreams comes running through your mind, does it smell like heaven and chew like butter? Because that's exactly how Peter Luger's porterhouse is. It comes sliced and perfectly medium rare on a hot sizzling plate with its own juices. The plate itself is tilted to give the juices a better flowing angle and you easier access to all of the steak's meaty goodness (currently $108 for a steak for two). You start off with a complimentary bread basket of lukewarm dough and some hard butter, but whatever. You're here for the meat. Maybe you want some greens? Do the creamed spinach and some delectable fries. Skip the tomato salad, which is literally just sliced tomatoes. Do finish with the amazingly crisp and perfectly sweet apple streusel, accompanied by their own house whipped cream. You'll thank me later. Cash or debit card only.

The quality, preperation and presentation were spot on. We thought the steak needed a bit more salt. We also had the delicious creamed spinach and german potatoes.

I prefer medium and she likes rare. Both of our steaks were delicious and cooked to perfection. My partner and I had the cream spinach as a side and our steaks and that alone was very filling. We also ate a lot of the great breads they brought out before. That, along with two glasses of wine ran $165, not bad! I usually crave steak once every week to 2 weeks and I haven't felt the need since eating Peter Luger. I've seen others criticize the service. Ours was top notch and our waiter was very funny.

I thought when we walked in that despite having reservations we would have to wait because there were sooooo many people waiting on a line for a table. We arrived a few minutes early (Sunday 2ish) gave my name and waited. We were seated promptly. Staff was super friendly. We opted for the steak for two, fries but started off with the bacon. WOW if meat had candy it would be this bacon: absolute meat candy. Slightly sweet but super savory. DELISH. Our steak was cooked perfectly medium (I think next time we will opt for medium rare) tender juicy and YUM. Fries were crunchy you can taste the freshness in all the food. The only disappointment I experienced was the extremely cold bread that was served in the very beginning of the meal. It was so cold to the touch and spreading butter on it didn't help it was like eating refrigerated bread.

Any establishment that's been in business as long as them is going to get the ""Einstein"" branding effect - as if that's the biggest genius in the history because we all need one person/thing to be the best. Yes they're steaks are top quality. But venue is old and you get that: ""here's your steak, you're one of a billion people who came and will come, thank you goodbye."" Not that service is bad, just it's became a famous stake factory at this point. I give it 4.5/5 for good quality. 3/5 for venue. 4/5 for service.

Â I've eaten at almost every single steak house in Manhattan including palm, galagher's, club A, wolfgangs, benjamin, empire, porter house, sparks, keens, etc.. so my palate knows what a good steak tastes like and what a bad steak tastes like. Â At Luger I wouldn't say you get a bad tasting steak but for me after eating it I didn't say wow. Â It was more like, eh...I had ordered the porterhouse and it tasted like a steak I could get anywhere for half the money or make in my kitchen. Â Also, the service seemed rushed and the ambiance was not as comfortable as other steak houses I've been too unless you like sitting on plain wooden chairs which I feel should be more comfortable when it comes to a high end restaurant like a steakhouse. Â I think if you're into trying different steakhouses or a tourist and haven't tried it here then for the sake of trying it I would say come, but if you're not into trying all the steakhouses like me and just want a really good tasting steak with comfortable surroundings then I would pass on it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My boyfriend took me for my birthday which he mentioned to them several times and I didn't get a single note of acknowledgement. We were recommended the German potatoes which were similar to IHOP potatoes but that would give them way too much credit as they were so crunchy I couldn't even chew it! There is no drink menu or wine list but you won't need any specialty wine to go with this steak. I have never had worse service in my entire experience.

I know this review won't make an ounce of difference to their status as the best steakhouse in the region, but still reviews are there to be written and I was very unimpressed. Had this been any other steakhouse I would rate them 3 stars, but being as they're priced like they are exceptional and being that there is so much hype about them, it's knocked down to a 2 star. My review is based on the food, specifically the ribeye, the creamed spinach and the bacon appetizer. I can get far FAR better for half the price at nicer places with better ambience and less wait.

Wendy F.,/user_details?userid=v_nzP2R1_wAyOw48D9ToWg,"Wilmington, DE",2/3/2020,4.0,"The food was really good. The steak for 2 did not disappoint. I am a Chicago girl and to be honest my steak heart belongs to Gibson's or Hugos Frog Bar (same owners) and always will. But, this was really good and great portions. Prices are about the same as any high end steak house. Parking is FREE ( I did tip) and it is across the street (get there early). We made our reservations for an early Saturday afternoon and thank goodness we made reservations. They had a line in front of the door before even opening and will only take those who have reservations first (so, yes make reservations - being rude and walking in before others just won't work - yes, some tried it). Now, the reason I did not give 5 stars is really no fault of Peter Luger. As you know New York is extremely over-crowded and horrendous to drive through. We came from another State on the East Coast. When we got to China Town (which we had to drive through according to GPS) it was like a scene from the movies Contagion or Outbreak. There were so many Chinese people wearing Mask it was creepy and almost made me not want to eat just get the heck out. Then we got over the Williamsburg Bridge and parked. Luger is right over the Bridge in Brooklyn just a bit beyond China Town. There was a line already outside of the restaurant and yes even in the line there were a lot with those masks on. Again creepy and made you not want to eat. A few folks behind us in line were whispering how they wished the Chinese patrons would take the mask off because it made them feel uncomfortable. But, I guess with the Coronavirus they feel it necessary to do (not really sure the rationale and I was not asking - and its on the street so they can do what they want). And, the staff at Luger is certainly not going to say anything to them - the customer base in the Brooklyn restaurant is highly Chinese (and, that is no exaggeration).

Sammy K.,/user_details?userid=offvi9U56RlfxiLk0AWK0g,"Austin, TX",11/11/2015,5.0,"This probably the only 5 star rating I will ever give to a steak house. I have been to most of the big name high end steak houses in Los Angeles and Chicago and Peter Lugers is on a whole different level of a playing field. When you strip away the butter and spices and want to talk about the pure quality of beef, nothing beats Peter Lugers in picking a beef and aging it in house. My dining experience reminded me of a prior experience I had on a race track. I was riding along with an amateur weekend racer in a Porsche GT3, which I thought was really fast. The following weekend I got to ride along in another slower Porsche with a professional race car driver who used to run Le Mans, and my whole idea of fast was blown out of the water! So bringing it back to steaks, I thought I had some good steaks in my life which I have paid handsomely for, but until you try Peter Lugers all other contenders will fail to compare. Peter Lugers is some ways has ruined my steak dining experience because now it is pointless to go and pay $80 for a porterhouse steak when I know with absolute certainty that it will not compare to Peter Lugers. I know it sounds like I am hyping it up, which I unusually try to avoid because I want people to go in with a neutral point of view to make their own assessments, but it really is that good.

Carina P.,/user_details?userid=iomLIuzqPWQIsLQCCInTCA,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",4/5/2016,4.0,"I enjoyed my Peter Luger experience. It wasn't epic though.... Maybe because everyone had hyped it up so much. We started with the onion and tomato which was just that a simple onion and tomato but that was good especially with the ""Luger sauce"". Great rolls / bread. We split a steak for two which came out steaming and sizzling sort of like when you get a fajita at a Mexican place. We got cream spinach on the side with this. Typical cream spinach , solid / good though. Decor was sort of old school. Clientele was ""middle of the road"" no one was dressed particularly nice. For a steak house and a meal like this generally I dress up and enjoy that element of the meal, but clearly other people did not get the memo. The waiters were friendly but towards the end, they rushed us out. We went at 8:15 which I guess was on the later side, but that's when they had a reservation. In hospitality there's a certain way to do something and the way the waiters kept being like ""can I pack that for you?"" Irritated me. Besides that, overall good experience though!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jinna K.,/user_details?userid=16oIbxACy8K2L1nmNJjmbw,"San Diego, CA",4/5/2016,4.0,Great old school steak house. Service took a lot of time but it was good service regardless. Their bacon is delicious! We had the porter house for 2 (which we split between 4 people) and the cream spinach. Cooked very well and their barbecue sauce was great. I wanted the sundae but I don't think I could have fit it in with all the steak!

Irene G.,/user_details?userid=t6LxuBvFEGZdJnvNz2LpPw,"New Hyde Park, NY",4/18/2016,5.0,"This is one of the best meals I've ever had. If this is what steak is supposed to taste like, then I've been eating the wrong kind of steaks. We started off the meal with the bacon. It was a good chunk of meat and it was so delicious, not too salty. Then the steak came out. We ordered the steak medium rare for two, German potatoes, and creamed spinach. I never had steak medium rare before since I'm terrified of a bloody steak. After taking one bit, I couldn't stop eating it. The steak sauce it comes with is delicious; it compliments well with the steak. The oil they put the steak is so good yet so bad for your body; it's worth it to dip your steak into the oil at least once. The German potatoes and the creamed spinach tasted great. We ordered the apple streusel. It wasn't too sweet; it was just right with the huge bowl of whip cream that came with it. The servers were very nice and friendly here. They made us feel welcome and made the experience enjoyable. I'd definitely come back. It's not too far from the train. Cash only here or if you have a Peter Lugers credit card, you can use that too.

Â Certainly something you need to experience at least once but you will want more. Â The apple strudel just topped it off perfectly and the cream...yum.

Sure the waiters are awesomely gruff..I love them. They are like German hit men and very professional. True prime beef represents only 3% of all beef in the U.S.. Most places that tell you its prime...it's not. Luger girls get first pick every week in the meat packing district before anyone else. They buy 10'000 pounds a week effectively wiping everyone else out of the cut they use. It's a T-Bone or a Ribeye, ""forget the ribeye"" and that's it. you get no other choice. Their menu gives you four choices for steak. Steak for 1,2,3, or 4 and that's it folks.

We had a 4:45pm reservation and we're running late due to NYC rush hour traffic, but were seated right away. Our server was a straight shooter, not overly nice or kind, but efficient. He recommended the steak for two after my dad and I ordered individual steaks for one. He explained the steak for two is sirloin and filet, whereas the steak for one is just sirloin. We ordered the PL Cabernet which was the perfect compliment. Our meal which included the steak for two, prime rib, bottle of wine, two martinis, a glass of wine and three baked potatoes was just shy of $400. I have no problem spending good money for an amazing meal, but I truly think everything was overpriced. However, you're paying for an experience at NY's best steakhouse for 30 years running.

Â  From the cold mugs of Brooklyn lager to the tomatoes & onions, bread and luger sauce, well done bacon strips, steak for 6 w/ sides of potatoes and creamed spinach, more lugar sauce, bottles of wine, and some great laughs with good friends like old barbarians roaring over a fire after a long day of hunting, it was a meal and a memory for the ages.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Miho H.,/user_details?userid=JG2epbMP6NQklVnMwrJyag,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/15/2018,3.0,"Went there for lunch on a Friday without a reservation and arrived there at 11:45AM. Already there was a long line of people in front of the restaurant, waiting to be entered without reservations just like us. We could enter the bar area sooner, but had to wait for another 50 minutes until finally seated. Our table was on the 2nd floor, which doesn't look as good as tables on the 1st floor. If you want to be seated on the 1st floor, be sure to make a reservation. Steak and side dishes (cream of spinach, german potatoes) were just fine, but not superb. Personally I don't think it worths visiting here, unless you love to wait. Service was okay, but wasn't that good either. My waiter brought me a cup of tea with lemon when I asked with milk, and brought our check when I asked for a dessert menu. Menus have stains, no table cloths. I have once been to another famous steak house in midtown east on 3rd Ave, and everything was just wonderful there. If all you want to do is just eat some meat, Peter Lugers is a place to go. If you value other things like nice atomosphere, professional service, go somewhere else in Manhattan.

Howard L.,/user_details?userid=6968J4CrW_NfbZxl5mxPQw,"Monterey Park, CA",10/14/2015,2.0,"Had a great night sharing meat and dining at a fancy place. Â Like many others was seeking the ultimate NY steak. Â Sadly like some others have said this wasnt it. Â Meat is tough even medium as compared to Flemings or Ruth Chris in California. Â Ive tried Maestros and Mortons and a ton of other places and so far I like Flemings in newport based on seasoning and consistency. Â Im sure even area to area chains vary based on meat supplier and chefs. Â Ruths chris in pasadena i stopped going because a couple times bad cuts ( chunks of fat ), once very very over salted, and another time well done. Â Once ok, but multiple times and $$$, i still do like the sides at ruth chris. Ok anyways if you do go to PL, share the steaks, if you are light eaters ""steak for two 100+$"" share for 3 people. Â The rib steak50+$ definitely more tasty but maybe for 1-2 light eaters. Â I would recommend the rib steak vs other. Â All the steaks they pre-cut into chunks and serve on big plates. Â House steak sauce as a side aka shrimp cocktail sauce. Â Its like a meatfest, i almost wanted to throw up, but i think it was the drink i had. Â Another tip dont order sides, not worth trying, ordinary and doesnt add to experience. Â And dont order drinks here. Â 46 bucks with tip for 3 drinks made very strong, bartender was a rude old guy. Â The one cool thing, waiters are qwerky, kind of fun; service I thought was great. Â We had damian, arms with big veins, looked like a james bond type, but fun expressions haha; Â i felt like i was in a english play!! Sad to say dont eat here :( if you are looking for tender tasty steak. Â Lack of seasoning/crust, and meat is tough. Â Ps dont order the bacon unless you like eating pure fat. Â Thats not my thing, ended up just spitting it out after trying a bite. Â I do like crispy bacon once in a while, but this was just seared fat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'm a Chicagoan who's enjoyed many excellent aged steaks, so my expectations weren't as high as the hype, but I have to admit that the hype is well deserved. Rather than rehash what other reviewers have already said, I'll mention a couple of things that I found to be different. First, instead of indifferent or rude service, we enjoyed excellent, personable service from Felipe. Second, cash and the Peter Luger credit card are not the only accepted forms of payment; they also accept debit cards. If yelp* would allow it, I would have given a rating of 4-1-2 stars for the excellent porterhouse, but probably would have given five stars if the porterhouse had been a ribeye, instead.

The Shrimp cocktail had 6 jumbo shrimp that were very good, the onion rings and French fries were abundant and delicious. The creamed spinach was the only disappointment of the evening. I had the bone in Rib Eye steak at $56. It was absolutely fabulous. The meat was so soft I could cut it with a fork. I had it rare and I am very picky with my steak and in my opinion it was as good as it gets. The desert was shared and it was the decadent cow with lots of ""schlag"" whipped cream.

Claudia C.,/user_details?userid=daw2jSO5xBLfOjX1DbL8xw,"Los Angeles, CA",8/18/2019,3.0,"I want to start by saying the food was phenomenal. Steak was perfect, sides were amazing. The reason I am only giving 3 stars is because my experience with the waiters was extremely negative. We had a group of 5 people and made reservations very far in advance. We were sat at a 4 top table with a 5th chair placed very awkwardly at one side. This chair was also located in an isle which people/servers constantly were walking by. I was repeatedly shoved or elbowed by waiters as they walked by. I would look at them after they bumped me to see if they would excuse or apologize, but none of them even turned to look at me. This went on all night so I ended up leaning awkwardly in my chair to avoid the elbowing on my back. Additionally, at the end of the night when the check came around the waiter asked how much we wanted to tip which i feel is very unprofessional. We asked if we had to say it now and he told us we had to tell him. It was uncomfortable the way he rushed us to tell him the tip.

Sylvia L.,/user_details?userid=p2qsU49DvbMrcG_nlejnuA,"Brooklyn, NY",6/23/2017,3.0,"An institution. You come for the steak not the ambiance. It's obnoxiously loud in here. Reservations are booked up in advance and when you show up you still have to wait. They make you get a drink first before they seat you. The bacon is really good here and we usually order 2 of those to share. The giant cocktail shrimp is also good. Porterhouse for 2 is usually sufficient for a party of 4 since we order other stuff to go with it. My gripe with them is that my steak comes too burnt and I'm not about burnt food. You usually have to scrape off the burnt parts before eat. Dessert for us is usually the key lime or the pecan pie. You get a huge piece so def food to share. The service is a bit abrupt and pushy. They only take cash or their lugers credit card which is a bit sketchy in my opinion but they've been around a long time so perhaps there's some kinda loophole or they have really good accountants. Because of that I prefer places like Del Friscos or Wolfgang or Mastros where you get good steak, good service and better ambiance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I have been to both locations which each have a very different feel. The Brooklyn location is more old school style, while LI was more on the fancier side and probably better for going with my whole family. Interestingly enough, the porter house was better at the LI location than Brooklyn; the meat had less fat but this definitely could have been a one off. Either location the must haves are: bacon, steak of two, etc, creamed spinach and potato's. If you're not stuffed to the brim after all of that then go for the ice cream sunday. It's to DIE for.

The German potato side, which is like has browns were a good complement to the meal. For wine we had their house Cabernet which I'd compare to a Beringer or other mid-level Cab.

Peter Luger's fits that rare category. Which is good because it's not cheap and requires a hike. Steak for three was great! And just right for 3 grown men to enjoy. They do cook it a little on the rarer side so keep that in mind. I ordered medium which came out medium rare and was perfect. Onion ring sides and pecan pie desert were delicious.

The potatoes were really good and the desert was out of this world. Once we were seated the service was fantastic. Now as far as the main entree. I have to say I was really disappointed with our porterhouse for 3. It looked absolutely delicious. However when I tasted it I have to say it was a little tough and extremely bland. Their must be a shortage of salt and pepper in Brooklyn. For the time you wait and the heavy price tag you pay for the meal, I wouldn't recommend it.

( $15.95 by the way) also got the shrimp cocktail and that was okay but the cocktail sauce was terrible Â and a few shrimp tasted dirty also we got a slice of bacon which was excellent Â .... for entree we chose the porterhouse for 2 done medium well at first sight it looked over cooked but was raw in the middle the outside was way over seared (crunchy) and it went from well done to raw some parts were very chewy and dry this was because .....and I don't know what the chef was thinking.....after they already sliced our steak they decided to put it back in the oven (Gross) cmon that's just cooking 101 that's how u ruin a piece of meat .....also baked potato was very dry ....but I will say this our server was amazingly cheerful and pleasant and we never had to try and find him when we needed something ....there should be more like him he gave me a giant bag of bones for my dogs which I thought was very nice .....so needless to say we will not be returning to this location ...there will not be any second chances (too many rookie mistakes for me) I will however continue to go to the great neck location where the food was worth the money,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

S H.,/user_details?userid=gu1sZWlVsoKWad0kQdFDMg,"Blaine, WA",12/23/2018,1.0,"If I could give this restaurant a negative 5 stars I would. My husband and I planned a trip to get away for Christmas and decided to come to NYC. We started scouting out steakhouses. I saw great reviews for this restaurant so decided to give it a try. They don't take reservations online so I called them. The girl that answered the phone seemed to be in a rush to get me off the phone, but I got a reservation. We had made the reservation 2 weeks prior to the trip. We arrived in NYC and we still hadn't received a confirmation email or call. I started calling the restaurant 3 days prior to confirm our reservation. No answer....I probably called over 20 times over the following 2 days with NO ANSWER! Finally 4 hours before our reservation I got through and guess what.....they didn't have a reservation for us. They even told us we don't take reservations after 9:00. Our reservation was at 9:30. My husband talked to one of the staff and was able to get us a table for that evening. We where so excited to get in after all the raving reviews. We where also bringing our family members that flew in from South Carolina to try this awesome steakhouse. We arrived a bit early and they where able to get us right in. We where seated and given menus. The waiter asked us how we liked our steaks prepared, we told him. He seemed very pushy and not really interested in any questions we had about the menu. He didn't even ask about drinks or starters. To our surprise we didn't get to select what steak we wanted. You order for how many people are at the table. So we got a steak for 4. We where each given a slice of there famous bacon. I was so excited to try this. I love bacon! It was thick, greasy and tasted like bad ham. The steaks came out and it was a porterhouse. It was covered in a greasy butter that was spooned over the top. You don't get a choice of sides either. It's dried chopped up potatoes and soggy cream less spinach. The steak was not good at all and I felt sick after eating it. The potatoes where flavorless and I couldn't make myself even try the spinach. At the end of the meal you are given cheap milk chocolate coins that look like something left over from St. Patrick's day. Overall it was a terrible experience and terrible food. I really don't get how this restaurant gets such great reviews. My husband and I have traveled all over the world and have eaten at some of the best steakhouses in the country. This was by far one of the worst we have been too. If you want bad service and food this is your place. We walked out of there confused and feeling sick from the whole experience. Plus the place smelled bad. Don't waste your time or money",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Courtney C.,/user_details?userid=GdSki3FZbpF68Yx-KA_8uw,"Manhattan, NY",7/23/2017,2.0,"So disappointing. I went there with my family for my birthday dinner. The waiter came over immediately with some steak sauce and asked what we wanted to drink we ordered one of 4 and we're taking to long for him so he said he'll get the first drink and come back( mind you he gave us 20 seconds to decide on the drinks). Then he came back with the drink we ordered and some bread, then took the other drink orders. He then asked us do you guys want menus- we said yes and he put them on the table... didn't pass them around. He came back quickly with the other drinks and asked us for our order. After he left he took the menus, and we took a bite of bread that was cold and stale. So needless to say we didn't eat it.

Dania D.,/user_details?userid=RhpJu1YradQoskytizr0KA,"Belleville, NJ",10/26/2014,4.0,"Dining at Peter Luger is definitely an event. One that is very enjoyable when shared with a group of food-loving friends. The anticipation grows as the smell of steak hits you from a couple of blocks away. Once you walk in you will find a lively, fun bar ambiance. After hanging out at the bar for a few minutes we were escorted to our table upstairs. Once there, we were greeted by our server who reminded me of one of my drunk uncles: honest, not afraid to hurt your feelings, but funny and a good time. He quickly some good recommendations (in a ""Trust me, I know what I""m talking about"" kind of way) and took our orders. The bread basket that was placed before us was enough to feed a small nation and had a very nice variety of carbs. Now on to the meat of the matter (hee hee). The American fries were my favorite side. The cream spinach was just ok. The steak itself was good. One of the better one's I've had but I wouldn't say it changed my life. Once again one of those cases where the hype didn't live up to the expectations. Desert, however, was my favorite part of the meal. The apple strudel at first looked a little funny, but was ridiculously good...especially when topped with that bomb schlag. The cheesecake was sweet, creamy, and dense. Overall, a very fun dining experience that should be tried at least once.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Betty L.,/user_details?userid=j0h7a14fDrDFD_19wen9qQ,"Washington, DC",9/19/2017,3.0,"Our party of four descended to Brooklyn to try this fantastical steakhouse ranked one of the best in NYC- if not the world. Â Starting with the good, the restaurant is on a really cute street and the decor was clean and minimal while still honoring its past with lots of bric and bracs throughout the restaurant. Â We went on a Monday night with reservations and still waited about 15 minutes in a crowded bar with very limited seating. Once seated, our waiter was an older gentlemen who you can tell is bit jaded by it all and has grown weary of saying the same old thing over and over again to wide-eyed patrons- understandable, but still shitty. Â The menu itself lacks description and the prices makes you wonder what the hell is in an $18 salad (turns out not much). The cuts of meat were also not stated, and instead listed as steak for 1, 2, 3, or 4. We eventually figured out that the steak was a bone-in ribeye, so you get a larger piece if your table all like the steak to be done at the same wellness. Â Well done is frowned upon despite it being a cultural thing for one of my friends from El Salvador (she backed away and ordered medium well for one while the rest of us got a larger steak at medium rare). Â The steak came out hot and precut- this is the main reason for my 3 star rating. Â The first slice was impressive- a buttery and silky piece of beef that rivals wagyu due to their proprietary aging process. Â However, because the steak is pre-sliced- each bite is colder than the last, and the last bite is not appetizing at all as you're staring at a white plate splatter with oil and a bone. The $18 salad turned out to be the same portion of a regular side salad. Â I also thought the creamed spinach, fries, and potatoes were bland and overpriced. Â The free bread was extremely densed and served with a cold stick of butter that was unspreadable. Â The signature Luger steak sauce was tasty but nearly identical to Memphis bbq sauce. Â Overall, I am glad I finally went to see what all the fuss is about, and I think reading all the Yelp reviews in the world would still not be a substitute for trying it yourself. Â However, Peter Luger seems to want to it both ways- by offering limited frills yet gouging prices. Â Gouge away, but at least give me a superior experience.

Tom M.,/user_details?userid=O46ffU-jVZWJvR5fdstXSg,"Milan, Italy",2/5/2018,2.0,Slightly bewildered at the rave reviews this attracts. Particularly as to why such emphasis is placed on the reputed quality of the meat. I'm a big steakhouse fan and was really looking forward to giving this a try. The steak is pretty poor. If you want a big slab of meat this is for u. If you want a quality cut I would look elsewhere. I probably left half of my steak on the plate. The best part of the meal was the bread which in fairness was quite good. There's clearly a tourist crowd here and perhaps over time thats impacted the quality. I would rate this as a NY version of London's Angus steakhouse chain.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

That being said, your hometown steakhouse does an admirably just as good job. To be perfectly honest, the creamed spinach was the best part of the meal. The steak (porterhouse) was delicious but it didn't make the journey worth it. What made it worth the 2 stars was the service. Don't expect 5 star service. Think more of a middle of nowhere restaurant with decent service. It wasn't above and beyond. Steak knives weren't sharp. Plates were thrown down. Tomatoes and onions for $14.95 with the Luger sauce was fantastic. But it's $14.95 for a tomato and onion. I will say this. The sizzling bacon was out of this world and you need to go for that.

Wade C.,/user_details?userid=JCJgwMXXBAfgx693C7zalQ,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",8/12/2019,2.0,"For a long time, the best steak I ever had was at Peter Luger. I was really young, but the memories of searing hot slices of steak doused in butter stayed with me for years. I've been back once before, and while the actual meal wasn't as good as the memory, it was still damn good. My most recent visit was not as enjoyable. Perhaps it's because we got the last seating, but I'd still expect a restaurant with a reputation to keep their meals consistent regardless of what time it is. Why even bother seating people if you're going to offer a worse experience, but charge the same amount of money? We had to wait around 15 minutes after our reservation time, even though this was the final seating. The onion bread was delicious, the others lacked flavor. I really wish they would at least warm it up a bit. Cold bread is not the most appetizing, even when you're starving. We ordered the steak for four, creamed spinach, and french fries. The steak was cooked perfectly, but lacked flavor despite being doused in butter. I'm guessing we got the worst cuts due to it being the end of the night. Even still, I'd expect their worst cut to be at least on par with what I can get at the local butcher. Our beef had as much flavor as the manager's special at the grocery store. The sides were good, but the steak is supposed to be the star. It was a disappointment instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Burt R.,/user_details?userid=06vhgOFVlgJLjZYRtHwfjA,"Scottsdale, AZ",6/27/2017,2.0,"Don't waste your time!! The petal on this rose bloomed long ago. Very poor selection of choices, ambience is less than mediocre, service a little snooty, and absolutely nothing whatsoever special about this restaurant!! Been there, done that, no need to go (or go back). Choices are basically steak for one, steak for two, steak for three, or steak for four. Â Side choices were pathetic and bread and bread was stale. Thought we would try this place after so many years of hearing it was the best in New York City. It's probably not the worst in New York City, but it's Â very, very, very, mediocre. Also, they only take cash which is curious. I knew this going in so it was expected, but it makes me wonder if there is an another motive (can you say tax evasion). Â To the ownership, try getting into the 1990s. People have been taking credit cards for a very long time. I can only assume you're resisting this because you want to make it an all cash business to siphon off the government. Â As for the food, if you want to call yourself a steakhouse you should have more than one cut as a selection. Not everybody wants the same cut of steak. Â If I were in New York, this would not be my first or even second or third choice of steak places. The hype is absolutely not worth it!

Went to pl tonight on a business dinner and it was a complete disappointment. From the arrogant attitude that both the host and waiter had to the absolutely average to below average food, I don't understand why any person would wait in line for this place, or really even go there. The infamous pl steak sauce is basically ketchup with a little spice, the shrimp appetizer was chewy, and I'll say it as plainly as can be the steak sucked. No real flavor to speak of and just poorly cooked. It's a testament to how a place can take on a life of it's own in NYC without having to really produce a good meal.

Now, of course, PL is widely considered to be the pinnacle New York steakhouse, with its deep heritage as rich as its ribeyes. It certainly is an old and timeless establishment with an heir of old time class, seen in both the atmosphere as well as the service. Very old school New York, which I really love. When it comes to steakhouses, my order is simple: thick cut bacon to start, ribeye (medium), and creamed spinach. The bacon appetizer is delectable, and the creamed spinach was also very nice. As for the steak, it was very good, but not quite the best I've had. The porterhouse certainly was tender and tasty, but I much prefer a nice marbled ribeye (I happen to love the steak at Wolfgang's on Park).

Staff were quickly on site and stopped the noise after the appetizers the dinner was followed by the porterhouse steak feast which included sides of creamed spinach and potato hash which made for a very spicy affair! As we got into a food coma, after what was an amazing dinner we enjoyed easily one of the best desserts I have had in a long time the ""Holy Cow"" think if your visiting or if you are a New Yorker you should definitely pay a visit here!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Definitely recommend using the Peter Luger sauce as it masks the raw onion taste. The steaks are cooked perfectly to your preferences. The drinks here are also very good and they don't get cheap with the amount of alcohol in the beverages either. The bacon they have is also very tasty and crispy!

Â Had been looking forward to a memorable experience and ended up with hardly mediocre. Â On vacation for a week and chose Peter Luger's for our friend's birthday dinner. Â The atmosphere, waiter and most importantly, our meal was less than desired. Â The room we were seated in was cold and looked like the back of a sports bar. Â Nothing elegant or comforting at all. Â Our waiter was curt and unpleasant from beginning to end. Â You could tell it was a chore for him to explain the menu and rushed us throughout the whole meal. Â Our steaks were certainly not prime meat and were very chewy with little flavor. Â I make a much better steak at home with prime beef from Costco. Â This certainly was no treat. Â The only highlight was the onion rolls. Â Then to top it off, when we were ready to leave and ordering an Uber to take us back to our condo, the gentleman taking care of parking for the steakhouse said there was a driver for the steakhouse that would take us for the same price as an Uber would. Â That was truly a lie as he charged us $38 plus tip when Uber would have only been $15.

Â Luckily I had enough sense to make a reservation because even at 12:45 on a Saturday the place was bustling and patrons were waiting to be seated at the bar. Â Meal was started with thick slab bacon and shrimp cocktail. The bacon was out of this world, even when you knew you should stop eating I couldn't help but go back for another taste. Â Shrimp was fresh, tremendous and delicious. Â Our entree consisted of a steak for three and a side of German Fried potatoes. Â The steak was amazing and every so often you couldn't help but let escape the ""oh my god this is so good"" as stuffed as we were we continued into dessert which included the apple strudel (yes more yummy noises being made) and the fudge Sunday. Â There is not one thing I could say even slightly bad or negative. Â Service was attentive and on point. Decor was old school darkly paneled walls with a nice collection of beer steins.

I ordered the steak for two cooked medium rare, creamed spinach and slice of bacon. They really do need a bigger waiting area as waiters with hot plates come and go quickly, but those waiting for seats can't really move out of the way because there is no space. The waiters seemed a bit rude as they walked through crowds of people instead of around, but I guess they're trying their best to be efficient. We got a basket of bread right of the bat, and they had some pretty good variety with the best being the onion bread that was also filled with onions on the inside as well. Their steak sauce is so good and really complimented the steak. The steak is half part filet mignon and half part sirloin. I preferred the sirloin part because it seemed more smokey and flavorful, but overall, it was a pretty good steak. The first few bites were amazing but after that, the steak seemed pretty mediocre especially considering the price. I really liked the bacon and was definitely one of my favorites. The creamed spinach was good too but nothing too special or amazing. The waiters were very nice and friendly, and were open to joke with us.

I don't give many 5 star reviews, but this is probably one of the most deserving. I think you'll find it obviously clear that the ambiance of this place isn't why this its legendary, you go for the steak and more specifically the porterhouse. Â  Let me make it clear, the 5 stars is just for the porterhouse, nothing else. The sides are good but not extraordinary and as for the ambiance, just expect an old pub like atmosphere. Â Don't recommend taking your prom date here. Â  Gotta thank my a big thanks go my big bro Phil for taking me here for my bday.

It's where I had my first OMG I love Steak moment. It's where my family and I celebrated me getting accepted into my first choice college. It's where I went with my then girlfriend, now wife, for my 30th birthday. And it's gone down hill. No denying it. It's not what it was. The steak was lazily cooked, with true crust only on one side, the other side gray and dull. The porterhouse had little of the dry aged funk that I crave. Same for the rib steak. The highlights of the meal were the bacon, enjoyed with Luger sauce alongside the tomato and onion, and the creamed spinach. Hard to mess up that bacon and the creamed spinach hasn't changed, thankfully. Not what you want the highlights to be at what was the best steakhouse in the world. Nowadays, steaks at non-steakhouses have been far superior. I'd rather plunk down my steak money at places like Minetta Tavern, the Breslin, and Osteria Morini for their monthly 120 day dry aged ribeye.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Michael G.,/user_details?userid=0wJ0NUV9fZvLYmjf22eW0w,"Holbrook, NY",1/29/2018,5.0,"Before I went to Peter Lugers this past weekend, I carefully read some of their negative reviews and I had to laugh inside. If you're looking to wine and dine in a romantic setting, then this is not the place to go. Lugers is an institution and have been making their Porterhouse the same way they always have. This is by far the best Porterhouse you can get in the tri-state area. The wait staff are not going to give you the warm fuzzy feeling you may want when dropping down your hard earned cash, but if you want the best steak for your dollar and one of the best eating experiences, then get there early and enjoy. In addition to their great Porterhouse, I highly recommend the Pecan Pie. It's the best I've ever had and I always look forward to this dessert at the end of my meal. Along with a nice helping of Shlag. Their bar staff are also very talented. Great Bloody Marys and White Russians! Solid beer choices and always on point. This is why I go back year after year. Can you get a better steak elsewhere? Maybe....Especially if you want a ribeye or a different cut. But this is and will remain one of the best steak houses in my opinion for years to come. They just do it right! Period!

I would pass on the tomato and onion platter. There's nothing to it but literally tomatoes and onion. German potatoes were delicious and of course their creamed spinach. All beverages especially wine was unreasonably overpriced. The $15 glass of wine tasted no different than my $7 bottle of Corbet Canyon merlot. Desserts: oh my gosh the cheesecake. It was the best I've ever tasted. The holy cow sundae is also a must. Apple strudel was okay. Finish off with German brandy coffee and your set!

Sabrina A.,/user_details?userid=WOFaLTUVKhftHZqoVekCnw,"Brooklyn, NY",3/9/2015,3.0,"So my guy had been dyin to come here and try the steak that he had heard so many rave reviews about. So i suprised him and mad reservations for us the past friday nite. Well its not much to say about ambience because there isnt any. It has wodden tables and uncomfortable chairs. It has some things on the wall and shelves but thats about it. Definitely not a place for a romantic dinner wit the honey. Any who the service was great. Our watier came over as soon as we were comfortable asked us wht we would like to drink, suggested some wines, and told us about wht was on the menu. We decided to get the 20inch thick steak which shares for two ppl. It came out sizzling hot and i must say it was a fine cut of meat. It jus didnt live up to all the hype. It had no flavor it was jus cooked meat. We had the spinach Â and the fries on the side. The spinach was supposed to share for two but the bowl was very small. It was alright. Extra mushy even. Ive had better. The fries came out fresh and hot. They were great! They have a steak sause tht they give u tht kinda taste like cocktail sauce. ..it gave the meat some flavor tho so i ate it. The watiers are funny . They crack jokes and engage with u as much as they can. We decided to have dessert since we had room because we didn't eat all of our food. We had a chocolate mouse pie with their homemade whipped cream. It was too die for!!! Other then tht this place and it s food was jus okay nothing special",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
William C.,/user_details?userid=LcRz_JekQDaHiwb5safXww,"Brooklyn, NY",9/4/2016,5.0,"This institution has a special place in my heart (not just from all of the saturated fats and cholesterol I ingested that night). This was my first experience with professionally dry-aged beef. Absolutely the best steak I have ever had in my entire life. I shared the porterhouse for 2 cooked medium with a friend. The filet mignon was the most tender slice of meat. It melts in your mouth. You don't even really need to chew and it just releases its beefy juices readily. The strip steak part is great in its own way as well. Not as tender obviously but so much flavor. They serve you free bread with your meal, which is great for using to dipping into the fat for ultra-gluttony deliciousness. You don't really need much else other than the steak, as the creamed spinach we got served just as an afterthought. We were also too full at that point anyway. Their chocolate sundae called ""Holy Cow"" is a great way to end the meal if you want to go the extra mile",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kailey C.,/user_details?userid=oL5yzRNi3Cos8M2RjAdN_g,"Brooklyn, NY",7/23/2015,3.0,"Not sure why this place is continually hyped as the best for slabs of meat in the city. Sure, it's traditional and the waiters and service all live up to that (including the part where the waits and the service are incredibly slow for everything, from a glass of water to the bathroom). The porterhouse was dry, and the portions were so huge that we had to bring the rest home - and things rarely taste good the next day. The rack of lamb was the highlight - was pleasantly surprised. Overall a decent meal - just expected things to be a little more juicy and tender, and left with more to be desired.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Serge F.,/user_details?userid=qbBRwc4Yjud0KG9bWEZdlA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/17/2014,5.0,"For years I was put off by what I thought was waaaay too much to pay for a steak. Finally, I was invited to go along as part of a party of 10. I was pleasantly surprised! Sure its an arm and a leg to pay, but the standard porterhouse will feed several hungry mouths. And clearly its ALL about the steak, if you want lots of options for sides, an extensive wine list, a fancy presentation, or a vegetarian option, this is probably not for you. But if you want the gold standard for a USDA Prime aged steak. You need to experience this place! Oh yeah, bring cash--no credit cards accepted, other than their own.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Nicole A.,/user_details?userid=JbH3P2JJLkhflM48hao6qQ,"White Plains, NY",1/24/2015,5.0,"This is definitely a steak house you need to visit! Whether it's lunch or dinner the food is great. For lunch, if you don't want the steak, then you have the option of the burger (which is out of this world and only available during lunch). For dinner I recommend the steak for two but obviously that depends on how many people you're with, although the steak for two usually feeds 4 people. The creamed spinach is great, as if the potato pie. Dessert is also top notch. If your celebrating a birthday make sure you tell someone because you literally will have 12 guys singing happy birthday at your table with a candle in the schlog or however you spell that wonderful whipped cream they make. But for dessert def get as much as you can feasibly eat. We usually do the cheesecake, holy cow, Â apple strudel (which is magically delicious), and the chocolate mouse cake. On top of dessert they give you chocolate coins to take home as if you haven't ate enough already lol.... Nevertheless service is great, and they even have their own Peter Luger wine if your feeling adventurous!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Kira B.,/user_details?userid=6Llv-EuQq-QAt-pjTWnNHQ,"New York, NY",9/19/2014,5.0,it is a crime that lugers is only rated 4 starts. The tomato and onion are the best in NYC! The porterhouse is stupendous. Make sure you get the creamed spinach and the hash browns. But then you have to leave room for dessert - cheesecake and apple strudel. Of course you can't forget the schlag - massive order of whipped cream included with all desserts.
