I don't have a wok so this is a dish that I can't make at home. The lettuce bed was not soggy and the ranch dressing was on the runnier side but still good. 9/10. The Cha Siu McRib ($27) was much bigger than a regular McRib at McDonald's. It is a full sandwich. The hoisin sauce adds a smoky flavor and the thick cut pickles are fresh and really help counteract the sweetness and richness of the meat. Be warned that there is hot mustard on this sandwich and it's not evenly distributed so you may get a bite that's much spicier than the other bites. A wasabi-like level of spiciness. It isn't as fatty and juicy like a similarly priced Katz's deli sandwich. With this price, maybe value isn't its strong point, but it's pretty well executed. 8/10. The sundae ($12) was a nice way to end the meal. It's very unique, as the fried malted milk pieces were something I'd not had before. Buttered peanuts added more texture, which was good here. Normally I am hesitant to add nuts to sundaes, for fear that they will hurt the roof of my mouth, but these didn't. They were finely chopped. Ovaltine hot fudge was pretty sparse.

david l.,/user_details?userid=74eE-jgCGO24YKIci38UcQ,"Brooklyn, NY",2/2/2022,5.0,If full transparency I am related to Chef Owner Calvin Ng 9n my Mother's side if the family.  The food is traditional Cantonese dishes you would find at a home cooked meal or a dinner out in a old school Cantonese Restaurant in NYC Chinatown. The dishes Bonnie's serves I've ate many times at home cooked by my Grandfather and Mother or at a dinner in Chinatown. Chef Calvin takes these dishes and puts his take on them. The Dao Gok and Cacio E Pepe are both made with a traditional condiment Fuyu which is fermented bean curd. It has a very strong pungent taste but both dishes you only taste a hint of it and melds perfectly. Both dishes was outstanding and the Dao Gok was slightly different from the traditional dish. My favorite dish was the Black bean class with the steam eggs. It's actually two dishes combined. Normally both dishes would be separate entrees. The steam eggs was a perfect custard texture. Everything I ate was delicious but make sure to leave room for the Sundae which was phenomenal. It was awesome meal and hospitality was great. The GM Brad is a great guy. It was touching to see photos of my family adoring a wall. I will be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bonnies-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Austin S.,/user_details?userid=ycd1cetEw0T5GoJI4PvQzw,"Brunswick, OH",4/5/2022,2.0,A friend of mine got reservations right when they open and you still have to wait outside (in the cold) with people who don't have reservations. You would think they could come up with a slightly better situation. It took us quite a while to be seated. The food is a little overpriced for what you are getting. Most of the food was a bit over salted. The staff is very pleasant but they are in no rush to get people in and seated. The cocktails were all $15 and apparently pre mixed per our server so we couldn't alter them. I got a Tsingtao which is just a cheap Budweiser style Chinese beer and that was $7. Overall this place is too expensive for what they offer. Most people are in there to take photos of the food and post it on social media.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bonnies-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My favorite was the squid, perfectly crispy and super flavorful seasoning. Loved the chicken broth and the mushrooms and sticky rice too. The cacio e pepe was kind of a fun take but leaned more heavily towards being a faithful rendition of the dish. It was really good albeit maybe jived together less with the rest of the meal. The char siu McRib was tasty and prepared well I enjoyed it but I wouldn't go back for it, didn't really do much for me or add anything interesting. I would rather just get an actual char siu bun. The only dish I really didn't super enjoy was the stuffed whole trout. The flavors were nice but the meatloafy consistency wasn't for me. I got the black penicillin cocktail which was excellent. Service was great. My only real gripe is that their outdoor set up is not really suitable for cold weather. They have some blankets but it's not enclosed enough and the heaters just aren't strong enough for a cold night. Don't think they should offer the outdoor dining in the winter if they don't have the setup to make it comfortable enough. Loved the meal but sitting out on the cold definitely detracted a bit.

I am appalled at the prices of the dishes for a poor take at Cantonese food. There is NOTHING that is traditional or authentic about this Cantonese food. If you want culture and authenticity, Bonnie's is not that. The food and prices are fitting for the Williamsburg demographic: a group that has zero knowledge on Cantonese food. None of the staff members are Cantonese let alone Asian. If you want gentrified food that costs more than an arm feel free to go to Bonnie's. Objectively speaking, the taste of the food isn't bad, but the price for what it is is atrocious. These prices really makes the person believe in inflation that's for sure. Got damn walnut shrimp had oranges in it smfh. Better off going to Chinatown, flushing, dyker, 86 st Brooklyn and etc for more authentic food. If you wish to support TRUE culture, this is NOT it.

Then we had a fresh baked sour dough with fresh soft in house made sea salt butter (Amazing). For dinner we had the tile fish and beef shoulder, both delectable and full of flavor. Tried the wizard's comb cocktail and loved it. At dessert we shared the passion biscuit and chocolate situation. Both were wonderful. So for $65 prix fixe it's a deal.

I'm so happy that I made the time to come here and try a lot of great food. Went to the back garden where they do their a la carte menu as opposed to the prix fixe within the main restaurant where you can see the kitchen. The service was impeccable as everyone was greeting me and all the staff was super friendly. We ended up eating with a chef of the restaurant as someone in our party knew her, so that was cool to get a glimpse into Oxalis' style and learn more about what we were eating. We ended up ordered... everything on the menu! My highlights were certainly the sourdough bread (which it seems like everyone and their mother is talking about); that butter was special!! But more than that, I loved the tomato spread with the rosemary lavender bread; I could have eaten that all up! I think the mushroom kebab (which just isn't a kebab at all) fell a bit flat, but still - all in all, this was a SPECIAL meal. The buttermilk dessert + the peach tart really rounded it all out. And my orange wine cocktail was delicious and served in the perfect glass. I know they have a more rotating menu here, so I'd love to come back sooner rather than later to try some great food. It came out to a bit less than $100/person, so considering it is a 1 Michelin-star place and we got everything on the menu, I think that's great; each dish isn't quite expensive so you can come in for a drink and some food and not break the budget.

I had the pineapple cocktail which was one of the tastiest cocktails I've had in awhile. Every course was delicious but we especially enjoyed the potato and seafood stew. I'm not sure how to describe it but to say it was savory and delicate and so rich in flavor.

I have to echo the same sentiment that the service was poor / hosts were rude and incompetent. F+ at best. I called ahead of time (5:09 pm) to confirm if walk-ins were available for the tasting menu--which I was told yes. After stopping by in person, my partner and I were told we would wait 25-30 minutes at most and would receive a call. An hour and a half later I called again to see where I was in the queue and was told I'm next in line (7:30 pm). So my partner and I walked to a nearby bar to get a drink and chat. At this point (8:15 pm), we made a quick reservation for a 9:00pm slot (under the belief we would get an option for the tasting menu like promised) and walked over at 8:45 pm and spoke to the hosts.

They have a prefix tasting menu but they are very flexible with food allergy accommodations. I came when I was pregnant and there were several items on the menu that I could not eat. Our waiter communicated efficiently with the chef and was able to accommodate every one of my wishes. It is a pretty big spacious space inside. It is great for an intimate date or a night out with girls. I had brunch there and it was delicious as well. They have a big outdoor space that I can't wait to try in the summer.

Went for dinner and sat in the back courtyard. This is the more casual Al la crate setting. Still a lovely setting. But let me start with the greeting. You walk in the door and the kitchen is right there. Open and inviting. Smells of the amazing good greet you. A cook says hello and asked for our name. Even though there are hosts it was a nice way to be welcomed. We are led to our table. Every member of the friendly staff saying hello. Now let's get down to the main event. The drinks and meal! Every dish was heaven. The sourdough (fresh and warm with fresh butter.) Jambon! Totally different then plain old ham or prosciutto. The tuna carpaccio. Wow. Balanced and light. Sweet potatoes (lovely and light.) Next was the trout. This was the star of the show! I could eat this dish every minute of every day. And the beef was fantastic too. Drinks were fantastic and the wine selection is solid too.

Lynn W.,/user_details?userid=3DYLC4ZCEb4i_-xRugurZQ,"Flushing, NY",1/7/2020,4.0,We made reservations for a party of 10. Our prefix dinner was $70pp. The service was amazing. This restaurant is more American rather than French based on the food we had. If you're looking for French food this is not the place. I felt the quality of the food was very fresh and dishes were unique and creative. I love the open kitchen as you walk in. I would've preferred to see the regular menu however our meal started promptly when our party arrived. I didn't realize we had an option to try other items on their menu until we were done with our meal. This was not necessarily the restaurants fault but rather me not asking as I was content with the meal that was previously arranged by my party. I was curious as we left the restaurant what else we could've tried while we were there but did not get a chance to try. If you have a big appetite this prefix dinner would not have been enough to fill you up.

Christin M.,/user_details?userid=383fieseMn4s6pHoNY7ugQ,"Baltimore, MD",5/20/2019,5.0,"Highly recommended for an adult evening out, special date night, or an occasion to celebrate. You'll enjoy an excellent meal, carefully crafted and conceptualized, from start to finish. I'd also suggest, if you're a duo, that you request the table with front row seats of the kitchen and the chef at work. I thoroughly enjoyed the added bonus of a show and it was really neat to see the composition and plating of each dish making its way to us. Oxalis offers a prix fixe dinner service (offerings change nightly) with optional wine pairing at an additional cost. My spouse and I elected to go all in and we loved the complete experience of everything being expertly selected for us - what a fun and delicious treat! We also relished in being surprised with the menu offerings for the evening when we sat at our places (hidden but neatly placed under our napkin and bread plate). Don't be afraid to ask questions - the staff, even the chef, are very friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes, the creative ingredients as well as the wine pairings. I was also shocked by my favorite course of the evening; glancing at the menu I knew I was looking forward to the soft shell crab and while everything was excellent, I was absolutely blown away by the potato, ramp, and kombu spring stew. It was so unexpected for me, I loved every bite. Both flavor and texture variety were perfect. That said, be open to being pleasantly surprised.

No tasting menu and the a la carte one was extremely limited, not a single meat entree and  by 8 pm they ran out of the only non-carb non-veggie offering- fish. Then they right away ran out of bread and tarts... i am being kind giving them 3 stars. If you're not ready then don't hastily re-open. We had to go eat somewhere else afterwards.

There are other places nearby that offer brunch but I had already been to them and wanted to try some place new.

So yes, it is pricey for brunch but the pre fix brunch menu is unique - not your run of the mill brunch dishes but still ""brunch-like"" enough...and definitely filling and delicious. If you love has browns or anything potato - Do yourself a favor and order the potatoes as an add on if they aren't part of your pre fix - even if you don't live has browns, this dish may convert you.

Had dinner here recently and while I understand tasting menus are not usually meant to fill, for the price we paid for what is billed as a ""4-6 course meal"", I left quite hungry and disappointed. While I wouldn't say anything necessarily tasted bad (besides the espresso we ordered at the end which was completely undrinkable), I'd say most every dish had at least something wrong i.e. duck not cooked well, entire dish being just one (wet) texture, etc. I do just want to point out that the ""snack"" course which, to be frank, was basically a singular tater tot sliced into 4 pieces with a dot of mayo on top (serves 2!) was totally unacceptable. Maybe I'm being a bit nitpick-y but in a tasting menu restaurant that additionally is only doing a handful of courses (also charging $100+ pp once you factor in tax+tip+drinks), they should all be perfect or close to it.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/oxalis-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Bradford P.,/user_details?userid=klRvOVWm2MwWCxXXRS7Vdg,"Queens, NY",1/27/2019,5.0,"Behind the frosted glass facade at 791 Washington Ave is Oxalis, where wonderful things are being made and served. This restaurant works perfectly for the part of Brooklyn it's in, which you kind of feel before you even open the door. The quality of the dishes the Oxalis team serve will astound you and are worth every dollar. They do rotating tasting menus, but also offer food and drink off an ala carte menu in the back half of the restaurant. You can tell that Nico and Co. know what they are doing, and also, most importantly, that they care. Being able to watch the chefs and cooks working so diligently in the open kitchen is quite humbling, but also inspiring. I think we could all learn a thing or two about delicious, fresh, new ways of approaching food and it'll be fun to see it happen here. Aspiring chefs, foodies, and regular people of all walks of life, in and out of Brooklyn, should give Oxalis a try. Maybe you'll learn something new, see something great, or just enjoy a nicely prepped and prepared meal, served to you by their nice staff. The last time I ate there, I tired the pig trotter and it was my favorite. I also had a dessert made with cream cheese ice cream, which brought out my inner fat kid, for sure.

Oxalis is without a doubt, the most pleasant, refreshing and jaw-droppingly delicious meal I've had in years. The food was otherworldly. We had the prix fixe and each dish was better than the last. The service was fantastic as was the atmosphere. I have a ton of food allergies to raw whole fruits and vegetables (I know, my life sucks) and they were so accommodating and created two entirely different dishes for me (though what my family ate for those courses was apparently also fantastic). To top it all off, the dessert (goat milk with honey and thyme - trust me, totally different than what you're probably imagining right now) was perhaps the best dessert I've had in my life and I've come to to the realization that was the peak of my dessert journey and I'm fine with that.

They call it Street Food. The plates are small and meant to be shared. Everything seemed fresh, nothing frozen or reheated. Good quality ingredients.

Then we had paneer chili gravy which was grilled paneer cheese with veggies in a spicy sauce. That was my favorite dish. Also got something called a mango falooda which is kind of like a mango lassi but with nuts, mango ice cream, and thin noodles. Apparently it's a very popular  Indian street drink. My friend and I really didn't care for it. It actually wasn't bad, but those noodles were pretty off-putting for us. Maybe it's an acquired taste.

Mohammad R.,/user_details?userid=EbLaR1aV1MxDM3x3_uQiGg,"Queens, NY",2/26/2022,5.0,"'Honest Indian Restaurant' is a great addition to the Greenwich Village area. The interior is very spacious, clean, and aesthetic - with lots of murals and art decor. Everything on the menu is vegetarian. We tried a variety of dishes - Kattappa, Veg Hakka Noodle, Samosa Chaat, Pav Bhaji, and Pani Puri. The Bhaji Pav and Samosa Chaat was my favorite. Pav Bhaji is their signature dish, so I had to try it! It was a simple, homey dish. Every bite of the Samosa Chaat was loaded with flavor - sauce, chickpea, vegetables, and fruits (pomegranate and apples).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/honest-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The sambhar for the dosa was so so good, didn't care much for the coconut chutney. The food was so good that I ordered the Pav Bhaji and the Kattappa Sandwich for lunch today, and once again, they were both so delicious. The texture and the taste of the pav bhaji gravy was perfect. The Kattappa sandwich could have been more spicy but it was really really good. I'm going to try literally everything on their menu.
