I made a reservation two days in advance, but I also dined on a weeknight. Upon entering Gage and Tollner, you can't help but notice the amazing retro decor and ambience. The bartenders were mixing up cocktails, and the crowd was buzzing in conversation. I sat down at a small table and ordered a whiskey sour. When I received my drink, I was initially taken aback by the ice in my cocktail. Ice in a whiskey sour?? It still tasted good. I ordered a New York strip and a side of mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and had a good char. The steak was so flavorful with the garlic, it was almost too powerful when paired with the mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were also very rich and delicious.

My Aunt went to Gage and Tollner on her last day on the job when she worked in downtown Brooklyn more than 20 years ago. I'm sure others could find similar stories if their family members spent time in Brooklyn and were fortunate enough to visit. What I'm saying is that Gage and Tollner is one of those iconic restaurants. That means something.

I love the ambiance old historic feel.  Has kept to it's reputation of stepping back in time when you come in. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately our steak came out rare.  We had ordered medium.  They brought us our sides and steak and we had to send the steak back. I was hoping they would not just refire the same steak as it dries it out and just adding butter to cook it fast doesn't add to the flavor. I was disappointed greatly at receiving a refired steak that cost 150 dollar sor more. For that cost make it right or re do it.

The outside facade feels almost historic for the downtown Brooklyn location. We ordered several dishes starting with appetizers the beef tartare, onion rings, crab cakes. The tartare was delicious and the onion rings had almost a sweet spice to it. For the entrees we had the NY Strip, the rib eye, the shrimp scampi and the salad. The ny strip was ok the meet was a little chewy. The rib eye was delicious and cooked perfectly.

Frank A.,/user_details?userid=9s7AurWtJa3iV_h-gN2QGQ,"Manhattan, NY",4/13/2022,5.0,"Brooklyn was once a separate city from New York with its own mayor and municipal government. A short walk from Brooklyn City Hall (now Borough Hall) was Gage & Tollner. The center of the Brooklyn culinary/civic/cultural universe for well over a century was Gage & Tollner which many even considered It to be ""Brooklyn's main contribution to civilization."" When Gage & Tollner closed its doors a decade ago, most thought that it was gone forever until a plan was hatched to bring it back. Due to reopen on March 15, 2020, the very day that New York City closed for the Pandemic, it seemed that it was truly doomed. But it was not and Gage & Tollner is back to its original form. Now people from Manhattan travel to Brooklyn for great oysters and steaks, IF they can get a reservation. And that is a big if since it one of the toughest reservations to get in all of NYC. The food, cocktails and service are totally 21st Century even if the ambiance is reminiscent of the 19th Century. For a truly wonderful evening, head over to Brooklyn and snag a table at Gage & Tollner.

Phil L.,/user_details?userid=fnu-cdxEWotijXVXqJOA4A,"Long Island, NY",3/19/2023,4.0,"I guess I fall into the category of old enough to remember this restaurant in it's later glory, but young enough to post a review here. My family has been dinning here since before I was born. I remember my parents would rave about the she crab soup when talking to friends and family. They would talk about the gas fueled lighting which I also found interesting. When I tried this soup for the first time, I had an emotional experience. When my wife and I first started dating, I took her here and we both ordered the soup. At that time the only gas lights were wall sconces, but the she crab soup was still mind-blowingly amazing. It was so good that you felt the need to tell other people. The restaurant closed before we had a chance to return a second time. We were all surprised by the closure. We thought this place would last forever. Then a couple of weeks ago, I was poking around online and found out about the reopening. I was quick to make a reservation. I was happy to see that everything looks pretty much the same. It's an absolute time capsule indeed. The only thing different was the young staff and patrons. I remember being one of the youngest in the restaurant before the closing, now I'm almost the oldest. We had arrived early, so we sat at the bar for cocktails which were very well executed. This gave us some needed time to soak up the well preserved surroundings. I had us added to the waiting list for the sunken harbor club upstairs, but was notified a few minutes later via text that the wait was over 2 hours. When we sat down I noticed the menu had different selections, but the she crab soup was kept a tradition. I ordered the soup. My wife had doubts about the soup being as good considering the current world situation, so she chose another option. I was hoping to prove her wrong. Well...the soup was good, but nothing like what I remembered. I let her have a taste. She knew just by looking at it that it wasn't going to be the same. She had the same opinion after she tried it. It didn't have the impact of what we remembered. The previous version was really that good, and was an experience in itself. Fortunately the rest of the food items ordered were indeed very good. The service had it's ups and downs. It took a nose dive during coffee service. No sugar or spoons were brought when the coffee was served. I asked for these items, and only one spoon came, along with sugar. As I was paying the bill, the sunken harbor hostess came over to let us know that a table was available. This little upstairs spot is not to be missed. Work out the minor kinks in the service, and please please please fix the soup.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gage-and-tollner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Check out my photos. Honestly everything hit a home run. The steak comes with three different sauces all so good. I think the steak was my favorite, definitely order that. At the end the bill came to about $115 a person with tip. I really love the ambient and love that they kept all the 1800s  historical detail and made it come back to life.

Service and the menu are old school with an update.  I had an extremely perfect martini to start, along with the she-crab soup, which honestly wasn't so perfect at $19: it tasted delicious but there was a distinct dearth of crab.  The Parker House rolls almost made up for it, but $8 is a bit steep for 4 rolls.  Husband had the clams casino - also kinda pricey and the clams were small, but very tasty.  For my main, I had the skate wing, which I liked a lot, and there was a decent amount of fish on the chop, so I didn't feel it was overpriced at $28.  Husband got the fried chicken, which was very good, but $27 for fried chicken?? Our friends shared a shoulder of some sort of meat, and enjoyed that, but said it was a little fatty.  Food was pretty slow to come out; I don't know if that was because we were there relatively soon after it opened or if it was due to the place being packed and perhaps not having enough staff.  I didn't really mind because we hadn't seen our friends since before the pandemic and much catching up was taking place, but under other circumstances, it might have been annoying.  I will definitely give G&T another go, but it clearly won't be a place for everyday dining.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gage-and-tollner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The best items were the raw clams and shrimp cocktail. The roasted tomatoes were just okay (and that's being generous). The whole black bass was over-salted, not filleted, but fresh. I make a better NY strip steak at home. The cut was supermarket quality, but a bit thicker. The potatoes and the two different creamed spinachs were awful and all came out cold. I don't know what the owners thought these terrible side dishes added to anyone's enjoyment - other than saying to themselves ""let's try different recipes than other restaurant so everyone knows we're not anyplace else."" And so... they went with ""god-awful.""  As for ambiance, it was a bit disappointing. It looked somewhat authentic, but so does a saloon in Disney World. The place was so loud, we had to shout to talk to each other. We tried it. We just didn't think it was worth the $290 (without cocktails) for two.

Incredible from start to finish. Just walking thru those revolving doors will get you excited for what's inside, which is also amazing front to back. The vibe is perfectly classic, yet electric as soon as you walk in and you're greet by staff who makes you feel right at home. We arrived early but we were able to get a drink while we waited for our table, which they transferred to our table so we didn't have to close out twice. Both the food and menu selection were perfect for my liking. I only wish I had a larger stomach so I could have tried more. In addition to the oysters and the parker house roll, the hash brown was INSANELY good and would have stolen the show but the dry aged ribeye (to share) was one of the best I've ever had. The cocktails were perfectly made, and the sidecar they give was a fun treat which actually makes them relatively cheap if you consider the amount you get. They have all the classics and then some, including a ""perfect martini"" there which is hard to come by. The vibe, food, drink, and people - I could sit there for days on end just soaking it all in. The staff were incredible from reception, bar, and wait. All very helpful and informative and even gave recommendation of what else to do in Brooklyn during our stay. All in all a great price for a fine dining chop house. Worth every penny and then some. As if that wasn't all great enough, we were able to visit the Sunken Harbor Club upstairs after the meal - worthy of a visit in its own right.

When you walk in, you are instantly transported to another time. Beautiful chandeliers and an old-fashioned bar await you. Then you start to eat. I had the mussels soup to start, which was one of the best soups i've ever had. Meaty mussels and a tasty broth that tasted like the white wine you often find in your mussels with a bit more sweetness that was well portioned.  We also ordered a beet salad which was delicious with pistachio and ricotta mixed in.  For the main course, i had the Monkfish which was also a good size and mixed in an artichoke barigoule with potatoes and peas (it comes with bacon but i don't eat bacon and holding it did not diminish the dish in any way).  My fiance ordered the Oysters Rockefeller (something you don't see anymore) appetizer as a main. Also well portioned and excellent. We washed it down with a Rob Roy for me and a Champagne Cocktail for her. A perfect meal with a Chevre Cheesecake to complete it that, due to its goat cheese base, was not overly sweet or heavy like regular cheesecake often is.   The service was impeccable.  My water was rarely drained and the table was cleaned after every course with seemingly endless waiters coming over to take care of us.  All in all, a highly recommended old-fashioned, classy dining experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/gage-and-tollner-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I had the she crab soup, smooth texture with very few pieces of crab, mellow flavor with a hint of sweetness from the sherry. I had the fried chicken w/ hush puppies. It was amazing! Juicy and full of flavor with a nice crisp. I'm going back for that chicken. My friend had the roasted sea bass. We both enjoyed the fresh flavor, it was stuffed with fresh oregano and was delicious. We had the baked Alaska for dessert. It was a very large serving, the ice cream flavors were tart a good compliment to the sweetness of the merengue.

Kadeesha L.,/user_details?userid=t0yamaWKaSInp6AoVPmJZA,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",10/28/2022,5.0,"This was such a well done beautifully executed experience. I truly did feel like I was at a dinner party at one of my close friends houses. The dinnerware is all mismatched and hand picked. Gives a nice chill, homey vibe. The food all came out timely and everything was really enjoyable. There's only one seating per night at 7:30 and this allows everyone in the restaurant to really take their time and also engaged with the servers and the head chef. We started out with a flatbread that was topped with warm goat cheese I believe, pears and arugula. Then we had a delicious fall squash based soup with pepitas on top and a delicious herb olive oil. Next we had a beef roast with mashed potatoes topped with radicchio  and olives. This was so flavorful it tasted like it was slow cooked all day. And to top off, molten chocolate cake for dessert. My absolute favorite part of the meal was chatting with the chef. The menu is set weekly on Mondays when they shop for whats in season. This makes everything taste really intentional. You don't have to spend time on picking something from the menu, you can just enjoy yourself!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/dinner-party-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Gloria T.,/user_details?userid=_V6R9gNmQv8DwGqvVR3qxA,"Brooklyn, NY",3/15/2023,5.0,"An amazing bar that is getting attention around the world. Voted #6 bar in the world in a short time since they first opens says a lot. My friend raved about this place and I didn't believe him until I went myself and tried it out. Their hot honey chicken sandwich is one of the best chicken sandwich I ever had! Yes, it's better than Popeyes and Chik-Fil-A (sorry not sorry) Their backroom cocktails are unique and amazing. The names of the cocktail confused me a bit but once the bartender explained the meaning, it made sense. We had 5 cocktail drinks and a DCP shot. If I have to give my favorites, it would be the NY Beet Salad and Japanese Cold Noodle. As strange as the names sound, it is really good. The staffs are awesome, friendly and bartenders are equally the same. They know their drinks and it was enjoyable watching them make the drinks (sat at the counter) Definately reserve as soon as possible! Reservations gets filled up quickly. There is a wait outside for the front area serving cocktails on tap (and offers food too) Overall, I would absolutely come back, as long as I get through Resy!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/double-chicken-please-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The front room is small and unassuming, but the back room is very modern and dark, with warm lighting. We ordered the mango sticky rice and the Japanese cold noodle (rec from a friend). The nápense cold noodle was DELICIOUS! Seriously a must get because it was so refreshing and interesting. I don't love dark liquor so I really shouldn't have ordered the mango sticky rice.

My favorite was the popcorn chicken! It had great flavor and was crispy but did not leave me with an oily/heavy feeling at all. The baby gem lettuce was unique, love the grated cheese.

Just come here to put your name down for the back room or make a reservations because the drinks back there were awesome.

I have waited hours to get into this establishment, both the front and back experiences. Their cocktail taps upfront and cocktail offerings in the back are out of this world. Our feast included the Hot Honey Chicken Sandwiches [buttermilk, thai basil], a Hot Honey Chicken Sandwich on a Mochi Donut [buttermilk, thai basil], Popcorn Chicken [ginger, white pepper, five spice], Koji Cucumbers [shio kombu, sesame, thai chili] and the cocktails I focused on this time out were the NY Beet Salad [Bombay Sapphire, beet, pineapple, cranberry, mascarpone, yogurt], French Toast [Grey Goose, roasted barley, brioche, coconut, milk, maple syrup, egg], and a Japanese Cold Noodle [Bacardi Superior, pineapple, cucumber, coconut, lime, sesame oil]. That popcorn chicken was the best I've ever had! I learned from my coworker how common a box of that full flavored animal candy is in Chinese convenient stores. My mouth just started watering again thinking of it. Trust me when I say their cocktails taste EXACTLY like their simple names. Fight your way to get in if you can.

Janet L.,/user_details?userid=TN5fjyo50vm7qcJtAbTwkw,"New York, NY",3/3/2023,1.0,Probably one of the most disorganized places I've been. Nothing made sense. We wait outside with no clear direction. They also made us wait outside. The front person was like bouncer. Was no friendly nor clear. We wait an hour only to get inside but it was even the back bar. The back bar was only place you could get the unique drinks. We only had the front bar which was just tap drinks. Wishing they had been more clear. So we order sandwich on the standing bar. Then the bartender proceeded to badger us cause we had not tip when it wasn't a service bar. Basically force us to get to go. Made some cheap excuse like that it was Friday and our busiest but a wait for 3 should not be 4 hours. The food ended up being average. Bun was burned! but that whole experience ruin tot for me.

So, we were excited to dine in this time. We decided to take a seat in the Front Room since we mainly wanted the sandwiches and you cannot order those in the Back Room. We ordered the chicken liver mousse + baguette, hot honey chicken sandwich, tofu sandwich, and a couple of cocktails. Everything was delicious, really great flavor combos. We particularly loved the tofu sando the first time, so we knew we had to have it again! The place seems to get pretty busy but at least for the Front Room it's first come, first serve and it moves fast. However, there was a long waitlist for the Back Room, so it'd probably be best to try getting a reservation if you're interested in that instead.

They have a front room and a back room. The front room serves sandwiches and tap tails while the back room serves more of dinner entrée typa food with cocktails. We got seated in the back room and ordered a king salmon, oysters and stuffed wings. We were surprised by how tender the salmon was cooked. It literally melts in your mouth and it had so much flavor in it! Also very surprised by how fresh those oysters are that we had to get another round of that. My friend recommended this Japanese cold noodle cocktail drink, at first I was very suspicious of its taste due to the name but it turned out to be SO GOOD that I ordered another round of that as well.

We got salted egg chicken sandwiches and popcorn chicken for food. From the front room, we got #1(aperol, passion fruit, sparkling wine, soda), #4, (lemongrass shochu, gentian, plum, green tea), and #12 (mocktail - winter melon, oolong, citrus). From the back room, we got key lime pie and NY Beet Salad. Their back room drink menu is all food names! Love the food and the drinks! Highly recommend key lime pie!

Inevitably dangerous because you don't taste the alcohol and then it creeps up on you later...the drink is sweet and really does taste like French Toast. It's paired with an in-house made chocolate cookie, that's pretty bitter but goes perfectly with the drink itself. The NY Beet Salad is also pretty solid, it's topped with whipped mascarpone + yogurt, which was super interesting but it worked. Also recommend the Japanese Cold Noodle if you are looking for a lighter, crisper tasting drink. Service was A1, and we sat at the bar in the Back house so it was fun getting to see the drinks made right in front of us.

Leah B.,/user_details?userid=M66TJktUjsWD3v_Gxhv12Q,"Washington, DC",9/6/2022,5.0,"Dining in the backroom of Double Chicken Please was a unique culinary experience that activated my senses. First, I tried the Key Lime Pie cocktail, which literally tasted like a bite of pie, down to a crust after taste. How?! I also tried the Cold Pizza cocktail. It smelled exactly like a margarita pizza and tasted like tomatoes. Did I love it? No. But am I glad I ordered it and got to experience a drink I have never seen anywhere else? Absolutely! Moving on to the food - everything was incredible. My favorite flavor of the entire evening was the Koji cucumber appetizer. This dish was a fresh explosion of spice and sesame with a perfect crunch. We also got the Popcorn Chicken appetizer that we ate before I even got a chance to take a picture; it was that good! As for the entrée, the Hot Honey chicken sandwich lived up to the hype.

I'm amazed that DCP would receive anything less than 4 stars. It is the best chicken sandwich I have ever had in my life and literally the best drinks I will probably ever have in my life. I am no expert on mixology but these drinks were SO unique in taste and presentation and DANGEROUSLY smooth. A favorite is the Japanese cold noodle- holy crap it was to die for. Other notable foods: stuffed chicken wings, fried tofu sandwich, bolognese sandwich ALL AMAZING AND MUST TRY. The ambiance is cool and feels exclusive.

Fine dining feels with regular NYC prices, we were well taken care of from start to finish. The ""Big Mac"" macaron dessert was sooooo cute and so intricately crafted. The chicken sandwiches were *chef's kiss* so good, and none of our party of four could decide which one was our favorite. I will say that the salted egg chicken sandwich really did not taste much of salted egg, but the chicken sandwich was good nonetheless. For drinks, any of them are good, but cocktail #3 at the time of the menu (July 2021) was my favorite.

A fried chicken sandwich would've definitely hit the spot for a fraction of the cost. I ordered the Japanese cold noodle cocktail. They all sounded unusual but this was what was recommended to me by the server. The sesame oil threw the drink off for me. As odd as it sounds, tasted like I was drinking sushi or seaweed. As for food, we ordered what we thought was enough for three people. We had the shiitake mushroom poppers, hen of the woods, a dozen east cape oysters, blue Crystal prowl ceviche, ora king salmon, stuffed chicken wings, and hojicha pudding for dessert. Sounds like a lot of food but it left me feeling unsatisfied and hungry. The only dish I thoroughly enjoyed were the oysters. The salmon was decent with the enoki sauce. I appreciate the creativity with the food but personally it didn't taste good. The most disappointing has got to be the dessert. I'm a huge fan of hojicha but the grapefruit did not work with the pudding at all.

Hard to get a resy for the back, but got a chance to try their awesome fried chicken sandos in the front, and one of their pre-mixed drinks on tap. I got the #5 kavalan whiskey, patron orange, oolong, longan and honey, and it was okay. Would def have preferred to order the fancier drinks in the back. We ordered both fried chicken sandos, the salted duck egg and hot honey. I really expected to like the hot honey one more, but was pleasantly surprised with the salted duck egg, and actually liked it better, as the flavors were so unique! Definitely lived up to the hype and one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've ever had. Hope to try the back menu one day!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/double-chicken-please-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Rose I.,/user_details?userid=Q8-8qyKnbgq2cAWGFHZB5Q,"Manhattan, NY",12/20/2020,5.0,I came here specifically for the salted duck egg yolk sandwich and I ended up get that plus the hot honey sandwich and the chips with a side of salted duck egg yolk sauce . I came here expecting to love the salted egg sandwich only and it exceeded my expectations. And the hot honey was just as high- they are equally amazing!!! So deliciously heart-warming and satisfying. I ate outside in 30-degree temperatures and was so happy. I heard the tofu sandwich is actually also very good with Chef Mark using his grandmother's peanut sauce recipe. Expect menu to expand and some items to change seasonally.

The waitress came up right away took our order for food & drinks. I got the French toast drink and it was so good! Tasted similar to a mudslide minus the slushee texture. I also tasted the cold noodle drink (tasted like a Korean buckwheat noodle dish) and the red eye gravy. The tastes and concepts are very unique and well done! Food wise we got the chicken sandwiches, salted egg and hot honey. We also got the macaroni salad which I was not not particularly a fan of.

Khanh N.,/user_details?userid=kjjivUvfP3lKJ4aeyFFJjA,"Piscataway Township, NJ",1/9/2021,4.0,"Double Chicken Please is the spot to try if you are in the area. If you have a craving for chicken sandwiches, you should consider trying. Just a heads up, their menu is super limited. I am not a picky eater, but for those who are and wants a regular chicken sandwich, look elsewhere. For those who are adventurous, they have the salted duck egg sandwich and the hot honey sandwich. We had tried both. I love duck and yes, it's an acquired taste but this sandwich did not impress me. Upon first bite, it was pretty good. Very interesting and I was happy to have had tried it. But halfway through the sandwich, I felt like I was kind of over it. It got tiring quick afterwards. The Hot Honey sandwich on the other hand -- phew boy this one is a show stopper.

Aaron Y.,/user_details?userid=yGwPGmo_7uiTxFElPzaa-A,"Queens, Queens, NY",7/29/2021,4.0,"Don't judge a book by its cover, or in this case the exterior of the restaurant. It was quite hard booking a reservation for the times that we wanted, but in this case, we booked a week in advance for a Friday evening. Once inside, the lighting was dim, but warm. The inside area of the bar was very high end in my books. I don't go to bars often, but this one definitely took the cake with seating and spacing. First came a pitcher of water and cups for everyone in the party. The weird thing I found with this restaurant was that there was no menu that came to us. My party all ordered on phones. I had to look on with my buddies to see the menu. I should have asked for one, but for some reason I didn't. I guess it was assumed you knew what was on the menu since a menu never came to us. Feels unfair to dock points for that, but I'm used to physical menus. That's just the way I like it. However, the staff made it a very comfortable and an encouraging environment. The staff explained not only what the schedule for the night was (the food that we wanted only gets served after 22:00/10pm, but also provided great insight for drinks and food based on our preferences. I came out more knowledgeable about certain drinks and foods than I did coming in. I ordered a french toast cocktail as I was told it was more of a dessert drink. It was sweet, flavorful, but it reminded you that it was still an alcoholic beverage. That little serving lasted me my whole night. We ordered a small appetizer which was essentially chicken liver pate mixed with coffee butter. Very creamy and rich in taste. The first few bites were great, but it really does get to you after a while. Thankfully there were 4 of us sharing that. We didn't finish the pate unfortunately, ran out of baguette. When the time came, the staff announced they will be taking orders for the sandwiches. Here was what I was waiting for. I honestly wanted to order 2 sandwiches that caught my eye. The hot honey chicken sandwich and the salted duck egg sandwich. I only ordered one because the waiter warned me about how big one sandwich was (thankfully I listened to him). I did try a bite of the salted duck egg and I will definitely order that next time. I ordered the hot honey chicken sandwich which was phenomenal. It had eastern spices / herbs infused and was quite frankly really big. Came out fresh out of the kitchen piping hot. Great perimeter, but the inside was a bit too moist for my liking. Still a solid overall sandwich that gets my seal of approval. I liked it. For the price point, it is on the more luxurious side. I get that you are paying for the experience sometimes, but it is a bit much for my preferences. Would I come back a second time? Absolutely, the food has its reputation. The price does too but, it's not too far unreasonable. Overall, great place with late night vibes. Definitely go with some friends and share a good time together. Bathroom also pretty clean!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/double-chicken-please-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'm a huge fan of fried chicken sandwiches and this one in particular was so good that we had to order another one. It has a Thai flavor kick to it with the right hint of Thai basil and of course, the sauce was CRACK lol. The salad was super fresh and all the ingredients blended super well together. Even the goat cheese was super delicious but not overpowering. The ambience was also super nice and they let us know that starting next Saturday, they will extend the cocktail menu and will provide small complimentary garnish pairings with it.

We were blown away by the chicken sandwiches here and we are picky eaters. 2 of us ordered the hot honey sandwich and one ordered the duck egg chicken sandwich. Outstanding!

It was a nice day so I figured a long walk and a hot honey chicken sandwich would be icing on the cake. Now I wish I would have taken a picture but i was just so grossed out when my first 2 bites were both fatty, chewy pieces. I lifted the bun and could tell there was another probable spot. I threw it right into the nearest trash can. I want to say I didn't have a cocktail so I can't vouch for those.

It tastes authenticity Chinese which was pretty shocking to me as the area doesn't have many Chinese restaurants. Their xiao long bao are better than any of the ones you can find in Chinatown. It is clearly hand made and the dumpling skin is superbly made. Although their cumin beef was on the saltier side, once I notified the waiter, they brought it back to the kitchen and added more onions and veggies. It came out much tastier and less salty! Their noodles are greatly portioned and seriously taste like the ones in China. I don't recommend the Chinese burger because there isn't as much filling as I would like but tasty nonetheless!

I've tried almost all of the noodle dishes here and every one is delicious.

I didn't get any pictures of the food because we absolutely devoured it but it is sooo tasty. It can be hard to get in but it seems to be a favorite of large groups. They have both sides of the street and the restaurant is unmarked other than the copious amounts of people spilling out onto the sidewalk and their doors being wide open for a glimpse inside. The tzatziki is to die for and the pita is so soft. I had the chicken with potatoes and the sauce really made the meal. The chicken also wasn't too dry.

The vegetables and feta tasted incredibly fresh. The fava, which was similar to hummus in its consistency, was delicious and creamy. The zucchini chips were fried and crisped to perfection, making it a perfect side dish that was difficult to stop eating. The shelled Sautéed Shrimp was well seasoned in a tasty creamy sauce. My only negative critique was that staff did not ask to see my proof of vaccination, which I volunteered and showed staff. The restaurant had ample indoor and outdoor dining.

Maggie Z.,/user_details?userid=2-uP_Db0SeV721CBYdoZ3g,"Chicago, IL",11/19/2022,2.0,"The food was pretty bland and unseasoned. The grilled octopus was good in that it was tender, but we couldn't taste any other seasoning, only the lemon juice from what we squeezed. The portion of the octopus was also smaller than what was seen in the pictures, so I guess that's inflation for ya. We also ordered the pastichio plate and branzino. I didn't expect the pastichio to be sweet, and it tasted more like it was an apple pie, considering the cinnamon and brown sugar taste. The branzino was the highlight of the meal, but was still on the bland side. This dish came with a side of potatoes or rice, and we opted for the rice. This rice seemed to only rely on the sauce for flavoring, because it straight up tasted like tomato sauce. Additionally the service was flat out bad. The server never came up to us to ask how the food was, never asked if we needed anything else, and never came to refill our water. We were able to wave him down at the end, and even then he only asked if we were done and if he could take the plates away. This place is not worth the hype.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Last time we were here the blonde haired waiter forgot one of our orders and my drink, also almost spilled tzatziki on my friend then didnt replace the spilled food!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Both Very simple but delicious dishes and also incredibly specific and delicious dishes. I recommend the Spanakopita and if you're not that into Greek food, or you got kids, or newbies, Get the Saganaki or the patates me avga. The patates r these perfectly fried French fries with some feta, herbs, and fried egg on top and the saganaki is this fried/baked cheese pastry thing with lemon and honey and I literally ascended off the ground upon bite.

When they opened for outdoor dining this summer, I eagerly came back, and can report that this restaurant still knocks it out of the park. Getting a table both times I came for dinner was shockingly easy, even at prime time, as they have quite a few outdoor tables set up on the street. The setup feels very spacious, and they've been able to maintain the same cool but low-key vibe that made it so easy to while away hours here drinking their house wine and eating simple, excellent food. I've had most of the menu at this point, but faves are definitely the saganaki, moussaka, Greek salad, octopus, shrimp in the mustard-cider vinaigrette, avgolemono soup (pre-pandemic, I loved coming alone during the week and eating the soup + the octopus or shrimp with a book at the bar), roasted lemon potatoes, and my beloved cheesecake.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I suggest putting your name down, getting a drink somewhere and coming back. We ordered grilled octopus, it was perfect didn't taste fishy. The Horiatiki salad, also good traditional dish. The waitress suggested the saganaki, I wouldn't have ordered this on my own but it's a must. I can't explain why it's so good but it just is, especially love the honey.

Peggy C.,/user_details?userid=eRCQMWE2tNuN7hXKUUfymA,"Los Angeles, CA",2/11/2018,5.0,"Honestly, I don't normally even go for Greek food as my first choice, but on a recent trip to New York, Kiki's was by far the best meal I had and I LOVED it. It was just the perfect combination of great service, really fun atmosphere that made us feel like we had found something special, and fantastic food. My friend and I came in for dinner on a Sunday and luckily we managed to get seated immediately. Didn't have trouble finding the location - just be prepared to not be searching for a sign that says ""Kiki's"" (I'd suggest looking at photos of the exterior here on Yelp to help you). I love the decor, which is super charming - also, note to restaurants, the idea to stick a small shelf next to the table for condiments, silverware and the candle is so SO smart...more people got to do this! We ordered a spanikopita, whole branzino, moussaka, and the ekmek kataifi for dessert along with wine. All of the portions were massive but so good and hearty. The spanikopita was so good, the branzino was charred perfectly on the outside and moist on the inside. I've never had moussaka before, and I feel like it was similar to a shepard's pie (and delicious). We were so full we had trouble finishing the ekmek, but try we did since it was such a fun mix of flavors and textures. Our server was so lovely, and when he heard we were in town for a while, he quickly wrote down a list of other restaurants he recommended in the LES area.

To our surprise, we were seated immediately! The food did not disappoint. I had the Kiki's breakfast--eggs, tomatoes with feta, potatoes and a piece of bread. Each element was delicious. The eggs were light and fluffy and the feta tasted very fresh. There was also a generous amount of delicious olive oil. The lemon sauce was excellent. My friend had the feta toast and loved it--though it was on the small side. Probably not a good choice if you're super hungry. The food was also very affordably priced. I really have nothing bad to say about Kiki's.

Grilled Octopus was tender, a squirt of lemon, or that wonderful vinegar present on all their tables- made it tastier. Our waitress informed us that Calamari was the special for that day. ""We'll take that,"" my husband added. I would have liked to try their catch of the day. It would have paired well with the  spanakorizo. Saganaki - honey and cheese, and sesame seeds, hmm - this may be the best among what we tried here. Also, the warm pitas and grilled sliced bread with olive oil.  We finished 2 servings of those.

In any case, I found it and when we arrived on a Friday night close to 6:30PM, the place was quite empty. It did fill up as the night went on though. In any case, we were told to sit anywhere we'd like, so we did. I ordered the moussaka, and the food took a while to come out which was a good sign (or so I thought). My food was lukewarm, but the top of my moussaka was crunchy. I thought the balance of meat to potato to eggplant was not very good as there was way too much meat and not enough eggplant and potato. The flavor was just of beef which I guess is expected, and in general I thought it was just okay. Ambiance was alright but I could see the place being really dark if it were dark outside; since it was still light outside, this wasn't a problem. Service was acceptable as our waters were refilled appropriately, dishes were cleared when we were done, we were offered dessert, and we were given the check in at timely manner.

Host was friendly but the wait staff were not attentive - proof was immediately provided when we were served two glasses of warm tap water. Not room-temperature-warm! Ordered the shrimp appetizer, which, served with a bread & pita basket, was delicious. Sadly, the main course was greatly disappointing. The $28 whole Red Snapper was very dry and was accompanied by inedible spinach rice, the ""roasted"" chicken was a small portion that looked like it had been stewed since it was pale with soggy skin.

I was really craving a fresh salad and I use to work around the area. Kiki's beet/apple salad really caught my eye. Especially since there's not a lot of places in this area that make anything outside Chinese food. At around 12 I came in to order and came out with my salad fairly quickly. Their menu includes a lot of traditional greek items which sounds delicious. I was very close to ordering their octopus and a dessert but that would be way too much for me to eat during lunch. I loved my salad! The beets and apples combined were just so refreshing and that was exactly what I was looking for.

A cool, cavernous environment. Always a line. Love the spanakopita, the saganaki (phyllo filled with cheese, drizzled with honey), the yigantes, spanakorizo, the handcut fries... horiatiki salad is super fresh and crisp. My friend loved her lamb chops. The only negative thing I have to say: when I was there over the summer, there was a giant cockroach on the wall behind us and it crawled under the table. I honestly don't get that freaked out my roaches (if it was a rodent, I would've been a lot more upset), but my friends were disgusted and squatted on their chairs. I think since they keep the windows open, this kind of thing can happen. The waitress was very apologetic and sent over tons of free desserts.

However, when a larger table opened up (seats 6), we asked the waiter if we could switch as it was hot and we have yet to get any of our food. Yet, we were told that the table is reserved (I thought no reservations?) and later, when the party showed up, it was 4 people (which they definitely could have sat at our table designed for 4). I'm not sure if they were just unwilling to accomodate our switch as they have already sat us or something didn't add up.

The fava bean dip was decent, not the best I had but super interesting flavors since it's topped with cooked down tomatoes and plenty of capers; however the bread and pita they served with the dip was very good. The chicken pita was good for what it was, it's just a pita sandwich. Mama's Chicken was exceptional though; not sure what type of cream sauce covers the whole plate but I definitely want the recipe. Everything was absolutely good. Service was a little slow but they were busy last night and it seemed like there was only one waitress working the whole floor.

Gianna S.,/user_details?userid=kRTPmsfOPrDGdaZIPcrQXg,"New York, NY",5/21/2018,1.0,"I was extremely excited to try Kiki's after all the good reviews I read. We came on a Sunday night four girls and had to wait around 25 minutes. there was a line out the door but they said they'd call us when our table was ready. The wait was way less than she had indicated (45 min). The ambiance was extremely cute, almost cave like with 3 different sections of the restaurant and tables right in windows over the street. Aside from the ambiance, there was a lot left to be desired. We started out with the tzakziki, which was ok- probably the best thing. We then ordered what they said was like hummus, I think the fava dip. This was possibly the most disgusting hummus I've ever had. It was chalky and terrible tasting, no flavor. We also got the moussaka. This was also disgusting. It was smothered in some sort of cheese. We then got the octopus which was nothing special- straight octopus all minced up which was strange. The spanakopita was the only edible thing we ordered besides the tzakziki. Last we got the zucchini chips, which were way too fried for my liking. The service was slow we had to ask for help multiple times and the woman would not answer our questions about the menu. The only good thing was the wine- which was fairly inexpensive for a carafe (around 25). The prices were good, as was the ambiance but the food was definitely not up to par and not what we expected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's got good energy, a lot of hip people, on a cool little street, it's lettering is Chinese to match the area and fast efficient service. The food is okay, at least what we had. The greek salad has all the makings of a great salad but I believe is prepared and therefore doesn't have the coolness and crunch that makes this salad perfect. It also needs more red wine vinegar. The feta and olives were good quality. Also the veggies are not cut quiet enough to mix them effectively. The grilled octopus tastes very good but definitely not fresh off the grilled, very moderately warmed, sitting out for some time temperature. The zuchinni chips are plentiful but are smushed together for some and not fried very crispy, I've usually had better. The mousakka was excellent. Nothing was at all wrong with this dish. The cheesecake was also very good but I'd like some fresh strawberries over the preserves. The wine tasted like I was in Greece again, it sent my senses whirling. They did card me which I took as a great compliment ;) I would prefer they were less timely/efficient and make my food fresh.

G T.,/user_details?userid=zVtIfa-2dBNunYWA36xLgA,"Manhattan, NY",4/29/2018,2.0,"I had the misfortune of having dinner here on a recent Saturday night at 6:30 PM.  The noise level was so high that the following day my throat was hoarse and my voice cracked. All of this just to try and have a conversation with the person sitting 20 inches away from me.  We sat at a table that was 20 inches wide so that my knees locked with the inner thighs of the person sitting across from me. There was a ceiling support pole directly in front of my face coming up through the table. We sat on high stools with no back so it was uncomfortable. They overstuffed the room with seats so there was no (and I do mean NO) room for the waiter to pass so each time the waiter went to another table he would have to ask patrons to move out of the way. The climate control system consisted of opening the door and windows to let in some fresh air and then closing them while the temperature rose to 86 degrees and then repeating the same cycle all over again until walking pneumonia set in.  I might have been willing to forgive all of the above had the food compensated for the apparent greed of the restaurant owner to put profit over palate. Not the case. The moussaka had a hard (and sometimes crunchy) thin béchamel layer when it should have featured a 2"" tall soft silkiness. It had pieces of meat instead of being ground as the traditional dish calls for.  Missing was a rich multilayered flavor profile because the seasoning was woefully underdeveloped and revealed a chef who obviously had no formal training in cooking.  That was no more evident than in the disappointing spanakopita (spinach pie) which lacked the expected dill, lemon, and tangy feta cheese flavors that should have made it an easy crowd pleaser.  The lamb chops were unremarkable and lacked seasoning.  How much could a little fresh oregano, basil or mint cost?  The pureed fava beans were unidentifiable in taste and texture and more suited to an infant's diet. The grilled octopus lacked a smoky flavor component to its skin and was obviously not marinated and prepped with fresh herbs prior to being grilled. The tzatziki was a missed opportunity to exhibit a balanced blend of garlic and dill. Instead it was a contrast between the bland and the blander.  The saganaki (fried cheese) appetizer was an abomination. It is supposed to be served flambe with warmed brandy instead it was just broiled. The ""cheese"" must have been a cheap knockoff because it lacked the strong flavor that the dish should command. How could they destroy fried cheese you may ask?  By placing it on a puddle of sweet honey.  Not even Winnie-the-Pooh would have liked it. The honey is unprecedented, unjustifiable and inexcusable. Saganaki is not intended as a dessert. The signature greek dessert, baklava, was underwhelming and unsubstantial in taste and portion size which in a way was a blessing to have less to suffer through. The galaktoboureko (semolina custard dessert in filo) dessert would have been fine had it not displayed a strong sour citrus flavor which made me wonder if it had gone bad.  Thankfully it was fresh and only the baker was bad.  On a positive note the fried zucchini chips with grated cheese were good but not good enough to redeem the multiple assaults to my mouth, body, eyes, and ears.  Perhaps this place may satisfy the uninitiated who may never have eaten at an authentic greek restaurant before and understandably have nothing better to compare it to. The owner may think doing something different is in good taste. But it just tastes bad.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Josh B.,/user_details?userid=IzgS9uVBsEJuD0iVD3bfnQ,"Grimsby, United Kingdom",8/21/2015,1.0,Hipster crap hole with unauthentic greek food at horrible prices. Only decent thing is the eggplant appetizer. The fact they have no menu online and the idiotic attempt to make the place unique by saying greek food or whatever in chinese characters also makes the place hard to even find. When you go in you are served soda in mason jars which is annoying because there is nothing greek about that. Right now its crowded and popular but the novelty will die down for sure. By the way I only make mention of the hipster atmosphere because going there in general for anyone else ............you will not feel comfortable eating your meal. There is nothing about that warm greek hospitality and pride in their food about this place. All people should feel welcome while eating their food so even if their food was amazing which it is not the decor and atmosphere makes it uncomfortable for the average person,https://www.yelp.com/biz/kikis-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Just know that everything comes pretty small so you've got to get a few different items to get full.

We walked about 10 minutes from the park to the restaurant which is located in south Williamsburg. Aldama is a modern Mexican restaurant that's ideal for a special night out. The spot is on the smaller side with a large bar and table seating around that.

Jerry L.,/user_details?userid=dXOV0wBcViWf7TYvy2ItbA,"New Rochelle, NY",8/22/2022,4.0,"This place is pretty unassuming when you first enter, you'd think this place was just a small bar with a few seats but when you get taken through to the seating area you'll see there is more indoor and outdoor seating. My friend made a reservation for Saturday at 5:30 and we were able to be seated right away. All the staff was very nice, we really liked the ambiance and the decor, one thing that was funny was the little water cup, now they did keep our cups filled but it was just enough to take a swallow of water before someone had to come back around and fill it up again. Now this menu is very unique and besides some things like guacamole this menu looked nothing like I'd ever seen in a Mexican restaurant, now that's not really a bad thing because the food was really good and of great quality, we got the guacamole which instead of being served with tortilla chips was served with 3 tortillas that were of the same consistency of a chip, no complaints it was great and had a little spice to it, you can tell they didn't over do it with salt and instead used herbs and spices, that's important to me. We got the duck appetizer which was unique and good, we also got the Taco De Trompo which also was good but really $9 for a taco? Now it was unique I have to give them that but really overpriced in my opinion, we shared the Asado which is a 26 oz steak, it's served with some cheese with fig we think and tortillas also with a green sauce, now the quality of this steak is great, well flavored but not overly seasoned and can easily be shared by 3-4 people, you definitely pay a lot for it but it's good, what I didn't like is when we finished the tortillas and were offered more we expected that it would be complimentary considering the amount we paid for it but I was disappointed later to see that we were charged for it, now in comparison to the price of the total bill it was small change but it's the principle in my mind, this is a unique place that is very pricey but it's also unlike any Mexican place I've been to before, the drinks are pricey as well, it's a good place to check out but for my budget I couldn't come here too often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aldama-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

""I don't want to have a hundred different tequilas and mezcals on our wall,"" he says. Instead, the bar is focusing on 10 bottles of each, available for sipping from copitas with slices of oranges. A happy hour -- 5 to 7 p.m. daily -- advertises frozen margaritas and beer and mezcal shot combos for $10 or less."".....  There was no mezcal selection, only one cocktail list with 6 drinks ($14 each), one with mezcal....and it was frozen...I'd assume since the founder of the establishment is a bartender, the drinks would be more impressive...to each their own. Food menu was short as well and did not wow me either (and we ordered everything with the exception of the guacamole) There are only 2 meat options on the menu, both are small plates.  One is the cecina; thinly sliced, dried, crispy filet( think beef jerky meets chicharron) and the tacos- very good!  As explained by our server, the corn is imported de Mexico and milled in house!

Gardea C.,/user_details?userid=oSSmir4HXFU9chAkyuq0Nw,"New York, NY",4/1/2020,3.0,Foods are good. I got delivery. Steak was not the best tasting but did the job. The salad and rice were great sides and tasted good. The sauce for the salad and the steak added flavor to the food. If I had to eat here again I would eat just for the sauces. I have had the other foods here as well. All the foods have decent taste and maybe because it was delivered the foods were not as good because the heat has dissipated and some were soggy. Overall it was good to satisfy a food craving and when NYC lockdown/quarantine is over I may try the restaurant in person to get the true taste,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ichibantei-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Joshua E.,/user_details?userid=dwlsG4RiIbgzb8xboXk0LA,"Queens, NY",12/3/2018,3.0,I REALLY wanted to love this place but there were a few glaring issues. First of all I ordered pickup and requested 5:30; they called to confirm and while I asked for a little earlier they said they could only do 5:30 so I agreed. Basically I didnt walk out of there until about 5:50 which was really annoying. They were somewhat apologetic but they weren't really rushing at all. In addition they could have thrown something in to show that they were apologetic but alas nothing. I also asked them to make sure the order was right and of course when I got home and opened it up they got an order wrong which should have been porkbelly but was another chicken. Regarding the food I don't know if the chicken wouldve been crispy if you order at the restaurant but when I got home the chickens was marginally crispy and the flavor wasn't anything special. I love their menu choices but none of it was really awesome. I doubt I would come back but hope they can fix up their dishes and service. Try out their online ordering for 20% off.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ichibantei-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The entree also comes with a bowl of miso soup (really good but was a bit too salty) and a salad (very fresh and the dressing was pretty good).

My friend tries to clarify that she said she downsized it. How you about to scam us by giving us TWO orders of a large AND medium when she clearly said she just wanted one order for herself?! The worker continues to give some attitude with a b***h face saying too bad it's too late it came out. We're like ok we get it. Then 5 minutes later he comes and taps my friend on the shoulder and says we're gonna have to charge you for that you know just to rub it in. Serious? Just my two cents for future visitors. Gave 2 stars instead of 1 cuz the food wasn't too bad.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ichibantei-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The restaurant has a couple of large wooden tables with stools that would be good for large groups or otherwise communal seating. The place struck me as authentically Japanese, and the employees were really nice, but the katsu don was just meh.

Usually when my boyfriend and I go to an expensive NY restaurant for the first time we share a plate since they range from $15-$25 per plate and the check can go up to the $60s for a lunch. When we stopped in here we were going to try the wagyu, and when were about to be seated in the empty booth section, the waiter told us we had to order an entree for each of us if we wanted to eat there. I understand covid precautions, but I have never been to a restaurant that forces you to individually buy plates unless it was a buffet (understandably). I'm disappointed that during a pandemic when everyone is low on cash, and restaurants are already struggling, this restaurant forces you to have your own $15-$25 plate of food just to eat there.

With the surprising amount of mediocre Americanized Japanese restaurants, Ichibantei is truly a hidden gem! From the storefront, it looks like a bar, but there are many authentic offerings from Kurobata Tonkatasu to Chicken Nanban. While these recipes or dishes aren't exactly innovative, everything is always executed to perfection. Their fusion concept of ""Japanese Soul Food"" translates not only in the comforting food, but the intimate ambience. The restaurant holds about 15 seats that are seated bar-style around the center of the restaurant. The restaurant also exclusively plays reggae music and has a wall full of record album art(very soulful lol). To put it off the top, every time I've ordered delivery, the food arrived promptly and was delivered by the nicest delivery man I've ever encountered.

SM V.,/user_details?userid=p45cR6QwR-hIaH0d4Mn-dQ,"Sunnyside, Queens, NY",7/6/2014,3.0,"So I was super pumped to try this place since it was sold to me as Japanese Soul Food. But I'm guessing it wasn't the traditional soul food I was thinking of (i.e. fried chicken, ribs, mac n' cheese, etc.) and more so along the lines of Japanese comfort food. It's a small place and definitely reminded me of Japan but when I tasted the Kara-age...I just wasn't impressed. It was just OK. I was over at Jin Ramen earlier that day and tried the boneless fried chicken, which was super delicious. My other friends really liked their food so maybe I just didn't order the right thing.

Joseph T.,/user_details?userid=Cns9kEt9-9wmuvUg3jNz7A,"Brooklyn, NY",7/18/2022,1.0,"I have eaten here on two different occasions with the most recent being 7/17/2022. My girlfriend and I decided to revisit this place after we had come two years ago for my birthday since we didn't get to try the pasta. We sat in their garden area towards the back right of the restaurant. I will say, the pasta did not disappoint. However, the reason for my 1-star review was the rats that were running around behind us. I didn't get through all my pasta when I noticed them and from that moment I couldn't eat anymore. Some other guests there also noticed the rats and one of them even went up to the area where they were to try to get a better look. When I called our waiter over and discreetly mentioned the issue, he nonchalantly told us ""Well, this is Brooklyn. There is nothing I can do about it"". He then asked if we wanted to move inside instead of apologizing about it first. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there so we requested the check. For them to give us a response like that knowing that is a clear health violation that can get the business shut down is unacceptable. It doesn't matter what borough you are in. A visual sign of rats is a clear indication of what is happening inside the restaurant and if it has a chance to affect my food?

My first impression of the place is that they have beautiful greenery but once I interacted with the host he was very snippy and I guess he had his friends at a table because I saw him go over there to sneak a sip to drink a few times. Anyway we were seated on the side walk which was still fine but it took the waitress awhile just to bring water to us and also to even bring the mixed drinks we ordered over. The drinks we had were nothing to rave about. We ordered the croquettes to start and they were delicious but the fried calamari we ordered was dry and oily. For dinner I ordered the ravioli and it was actually pretty decent, we also got skirt steak and it was good but the quantity of the dish was lacking. There was a few slices of steak on a plate but not much to eat. Overall I'm giving this place a 2 star because the hospitality was lacking, waitress was lacking, and food was just ok.

Also the burrata and prosciutto with rosemary flatbread was so good.We pretty much ate ordered dessert and was handed bill. We spent $350 in an hour and rushed out. Again, the food was delicious.

But i digress lets get to the food!! So i had the crab and avocado eggs Benedict the egg was so perfectly cooked that the yolk popped and ran down the plate like a beautiful waterfall. The crab was seasoned and tasted so succulent the greens were so complimented on the dish that it was as perfectly paired as a pb+j sandwich. My boy Sebastian had the short rib burger, looking at the juices flow on that bad boy i said I'll risk it all, Covid? Bring it! I bit in to that bad boy and fell in to a delicious sea of tenderness and perfect seasoning, it was as awesome as encountering your first burger, Revolutionary. The salmon eggs Benedict were also so delicious, the smoked capers placed on top were so crunchy and the tomato complimented the salmon perfectly! Aurora is definitely top 5 for me in food places i enjoy going too.

But this server had the worst attitude and The server (didn't catch his name) but had a man bun or a top knot. He was the worst. Forgot multiple times about drink orders. We had to remind him about a second bottle of wine and to refill our waters. He then brought the 2nd wine bottle over and slammed it on the table without letting us try the wine.

Soft inside and crunchy outside and were quick with refills. The entrees were tasty. I got the Parma eggs Benedict which the waiter said was the most popular dish and I can see why.

Too bad it's only a special for the night because it was delicious. Sadly my squid ink pasta entree was terrible. It was so fishy tasting. It was overwhelmingly fishy. I forced myself to not breathe and eat a few bites because I didn't want to offend them if they saw that I didn't touch my food (I am way too polite at restaurants..Sometimes to my own detriment). I've had squid ink pasta so many times at so many different places so I have no idea why this one had such a fishy taste. Maybe it was the clams??

Thin crispy batter, the right amounts of salt and super dense calamari. We also had the octopus, which was great in both flavour and consistency too. We followed with pasta. I had a home made saffron pasta with shrimp ragu. It had a distinct flavour of sea, in a good way, and the pasta was cooked al dente. A great pasta dish. My husband had spaghetti vongole- also good but it as memorable. The service was superb throughout. We got a wine recommended that was great with our food. The proof of how happy we where must have been that we returned for a second dinner during our five night stay in Williamsburg (which was just as good).

It's comfortable, natural lighting through large windows. The staff are down to earth, casually dressed, very comfortable vibe. There's optional outdoor seating in the summer...or a closed outdoor seating area in the winter. I think they make their own pasta in house. The flavors of their dishes are really well put together. For brunch I had a salmon dish. It came with avocado, cured salmon, goat cheese, poached egg on a whole wheat bread. Very good. Overall, they use simple but good ingredients to make outstanding dishes and I highly recommend. The prices are moderate. The bill was $95 for three dishes, one appetizer(heirloom squash it was sweet and salty), one drink(mimosa) and 2 lemonades. Lemonade was $4 each. Tasted fresh as if it was homemade.

The wait staff was attentive and the food was delicious. My favorite meal was the avocado crab toast!! Omg!! It was really really good. We had the outside area and with the decor of the shower and the plants the restaurant has throughout the outside area made it the ideal space for my whimsical baby shower.

We originally chose this spot because it has a really lovely outdoor garden area, but it ended up being booked out for a private party. The inside of Aurora is very simple with dark wood floors and tables, brick walls, and minimal decor. I got the paccheri pasta with eggplant and mozzarella- it was delicious and I love how all of their pastas are made in house daily. That is quite a rare thing at most Italian restaurants in New York. The only negative is that there weren't that many exciting options on the menu. It was the very usual eggs benedict, frittata, and burger options.

We started with risotto croquettes and a three cheese plate with figs and honey which were excellent. The white we paired was excellent, moderately priced and was recommended by the waiter. I ordered the butternut squash gnocchi which was incredible, best I ever tasted. I also tried the Montauk sea scallops which were also amazing. Each entree at the table was delicious.

Nichole K.,/user_details?userid=aFHoc8JGImkeHC65pOrxew,"Brooklyn, NY",6/1/2017,5.0,"I struggled if I wanted to give four stars or five, but ultimately, the bottom line is the food was really good. The service was great. The ambience (we sat outside) was beautiful & so welcoming. The prosciutto was so tender & not slimy which prosciutto can sometimes be. The olive oil they put on the table, on a silky note, was one of my favorite parts. They make their own pasta. I love places that do this. You can tell it to. It really is so much better than dried pasta. The two things I didn't like were the amount they gave you. We had a table of about 15. I looked down the table at the end & everyone's plate was licked clean. Yes, that means they like it, but it also means there were some people probably still hungry. For the price, I believe the portion sizes could be a little bigger. The second thing is the Williamsburg 'your lucky to be eating here' that some of the younger generations foster. Let me explain. They don't want to give you bread with olive oil because it makes the tables too messy and the menus get ruined. The menus are printed on a thick resume type paper. Really. Just print more. We were starving b/c our party got there at 7 & didn't order until 8:30. I don't know whose fault it was. It could have easily been someone at our big table causing the lag, so I can't point fingers. But if one end of the table is telling you they are starving, please oblige. It's a restaurant. This goes back to, 'no, we can't give you a side of fresh fruit even though we serve it as a side on another dish.' Mentality, that makes me mad. One reason people go out to eat is because of choices. Enough of my rant. I would eat here again. Although not if I was really hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We walked by Aurora which was pretty empty (it was around 6pm on a Friday) and decided to go in. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and has a lovely outdoor seating area which I highly recommend if you can get it, we were not able to sit outside due to reservations and by 6:30 the entire restaurant was packed so in the future I would make a reservation. Our server was wonderful, very nice and quick which was perfect since we had less than an hour for dinner. I ordered a cocktail called the Darlington, essentially a very upscale vodka tonic which was good but very small for the price. I then chose the Arctic Char, it was on the specials so I don't know how often they have it, but if they do when you go it is a MUST. Perfectly cooked fish, smoothy creamy polenta and amazing charred artichoke hearts. Pure heaven. Date got the fazzoletti with lamb ragù which he said was delicious.

Melissa B.,/user_details?userid=g5ey_hlO9xmViRv8omAX6A,"Manhattan, NY",10/12/2015,5.0,"2 weeks ago I had my Sunday afternoon wedding here.  I was looking for a rustic outdoor brooklyn wedding venue and found this on google.  The images I found from past weddings were so beautiful I had to check it out.  The food is all delicious and the portions are good.  The place itself is so pretty with the fresh ivy and exposed brick you don't need a lot of decorations.  I worked with Irene from their events team throughout the process and she was always there to answer any questions I had, plus she is super sweet.  My wedding was a perfect success and my friends and family couldn't stop talking about how lovely the place was and how amazing all the food was.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Gee L.,/user_details?userid=LkwpTUySJ25ejSnTsfEUHA,"West Palm Beach, FL",3/27/2016,3.0,"Typical hipster place in Williamsburg. It's cute and rustic but like a typical hipster DB place, they wouldn't seat the entire party without everyone being present. It was Easter Sunday morning at 11AM and quiet. I told my party to go ahead and just start ordering and eating. They did. It was filling up by the time I got there but I ordered and the rest of the party ordered coffee/tea. I got a green fave bean salad which I finished rather quickly. It looked promising and fresh, but I'm not sure what ingredients they used. I started coughing a bit (I'm allergic to preservatives) so I'm convinced something in there - maybe their dressing - was NOT fresh. Waitstaff was pleasant but they wanted us out. This place is nothing special and with so many other places around, don't go out of your way to come here - especially from Queens - unless your friend who is leaving back to Japan selected the place.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
