I think this would be a great date spot, the chairs were super comfy, the lighting was perfect for a date and felt intimate. My one complaint was the table next to us was a group of 5 and they were taking photos of each other all night with the flash on and were SO loud but that is certainly not the fault of the restaurant - did make me think it could be a good group dinner spot as well. We had the charcuterie board but with no meat, I imagine the meat would have been nice but friend was a vegetarian. Also got the pesto pasta with nice thick noodles that I LOVED the cook and texture of it. We also got the pistachio dessert that was so unexpectedly amazing, I wasn't sure what to expect but it was almost like a thick pudding pistachio bottom with a moist cake on top I think that might have been my fav dish of the night!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bac%C3%A0n-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I ordered the cicchetti (smaller portion) of the pici (pesto pasta) and my partner ordered the agnolotti in the regular portion. The pici was completely vegan!

The broccoli dish came with 4 pieces of broccoli lol. And the burrata had some strange fish on it. Burrata and fish - not a great combo. I've never not wanted to finish a burrata dish at a restaurant before. The polenta fries were inedible (they took this off our check which is kind, and we didn't ask for them to do that).

I eat a lot of Thai food, and this ended up being one of the best meals of my life. To start, we had the Yum Hua Plee and it was ridiculously good. Similar to Laab, but a bit more unique. Delicious. For mains, we had the Gai Tod Had Yai (fried chicken) which was very good and came with some excellent sticky rice and two very good dipping sauces. We also had the Jor Rang, a coconut milk + shrimp curry which... I am still thinking about the flavor that this had. Indescribably good. And then I also had a Thai Iced Tea, which was the best Thai Iced Tea I've ever had. The ambiance was great, it's a cute little spot, would be great for a date night. They played Asian pop music in a cozy brick-walled space with nice lighting. The service was also excellent, very quick with the servers offering us great recs (everything we ordered was at their recommendation, and they didn't steer us wrong). Unfortunately, we were the only people in the place on a Friday night, so I'm hoping that this place can hang on long enough for other people to discover what a hidden gem it is.

Quite upsetting. We also looked at the desserts, and I asked the server for a recommendation on the ricotta cheesecake. He said it was good and would recommend it. I had a few bites and was highly disappointed. It tasted grainy and I would rather a cheesecake from the grocery store.

Christina M.,/user_details?userid=awvUoM_YS0SRiCctFiefeA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/23/2022,5.0,"Wow. I dined here with my best friend on a Thursday night for an early dinner at 6:30pm. I made a reservation on open table and had no issues with booking. When I arrived I was welcomed by a beautiful floral arrangement on the outside of the establishment giving a romantic cozy vibe. The inside is also very warm and gives a rustic Italian aesthetic. There are about 20-30 tables so a decent size seating arrangement available. My friend and I were greeted right away by the host and since there were a couple of empty seats we were able to pick ours. We were given water and bread as well as olive oil and balsamic within the first 5 minutes of seating. Our waitress was very friendly and told us the daily specials. The menu has a wide variety of options to choose from and we ended up deciding on the burrata con basilico and the insalata tiepida di polipo (warm octopus potatoes black olives and capers) for appetizers, and we decided to split the cappellacci tartufo e porcini ( spinach ravioli with truffle mushroom and ricotta) for the main. The appetizers arrived within 10 minutes of ordering. We tried the octopus first and it was so tender and well cooked! The potatoes were also cooked perfectly and the dish itself was well thought out. I was worried the capers and olives would be a bit overpowering but it was balanced. The burrata was very fresh as well as the tomato so no complaints here. With the appetizers being that delicious I was curious if the pasta would shine and it did. The ravioli was very fresh and the ricotta and mushroom filling was so creamy.  The dish itself was very filling but my friend and I had a little more room for one more savory dish and we ended up ordering the octopus appetizer again since it was that good. To no surprise it tasted the same as the first time we had it where the octopus was cooked to perfection. We then ordered the tiramisu and affogato for dessert. It would be hard to mess up an affogato being that it's gelato and espresso and of course da Andrea had a good one. The bonus was the two pieces of fresh biscotti that accompanied the dessert which was a pleasant bite. The only one thing I would call out is that I wish there was a straw to drink the rest of affogato that melted in the bowl (this did not stop my friend who was determined to finish this). Lastly, the tiramisu was delicious. The lady fingers were nicely soaked to give a hint of coffee and the cream was very light and airy. Overall the combination of the exceptional service, cozy ambiance and delicious food would make this place a must for me to come back to again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We didn't mind the short wait as it allowed us to view what other diners were enjoying to make our decisions early. Everything we ordered was a major hit. The special salad with duck and cranberry was a shocking favorite. The Cavatelli was so popular that night and it lived up to the hype (you'll sleep like a baby afterwards) and the Pappardelle was flavorful and delicate. You can taste that the pasta is homemade. For desert we had the tiramisu on the house for our brief wait and were so thankful because it was absolutely delicious.

Jeremy L.,/user_details?userid=Sguz3P4FuCiNJDN0_vd_8g,"Boston, MA",8/11/2022,4.0,"A very good Italian place for date night or just enjoying with friends. The waiter recommended we substitute the pappardelle with fettucine to hold the sauce a bit better and it worked out great - the pasta was very delicious. The tigelle with parma prosciutto is a must try; the tigelle buns are very interesting with just a hint of sweetness and crispy on the outside but soft inside, which complements the parma ham well for a sweet and savory combo. The weaker dish would be the warm octopus salad. The octopus was cooked very nicely but the potatoes and tomatoes felt out of place; the dish could've used something more tart and fresh for the sauce and gone for light and zingy instead of the potato starch on top of the octopus chewiness. Overall not the cheapest option (we spent $44 per person including tips for 2 appetizers and 1 pasta) but very solid nonetheless.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The outside is beautifully decorated, with flowers and plants makes for great pictures and cozy vibes! Now to the important part... the food!!!! I gotta say, I can't say anything bad! Lol. Every dish was scrumptious, delicious, chefs kiss! And please trust the waiter's recommendation because he was on point. I can't remember our waiters name but he was the nicest! He recommended the beet risotto and although that might sound questionable, it was questionably delicious.!!!! I love beet anyway so I didn't have a problem with it but besides the dish being delicious, it was also pretty to look at! Every dish we had was just exploding with flavors! Another favorite was the truffle ravioli!!! To die for. We also had steak equally delicious and last but certainly not least... the pannacota! I mean wow!!!!! If you've read my other reviews you know I love me some pannacota!! This one was literally the best one I've ever had!!!  In a nutshell lol... visiting this restaurant is a must!! We will be back.

Sam And Josie R.,/user_details?userid=SStepUhrsnEGgt4k4CdyHA,"New York, NY",1/15/2023,4.0,"We decided to get dinner last minute today. We were thinking Buddakan, but that was a strikeout--obviously. After some research, thanks to the Yelp algorithm, we stumbled across the hidden gem(but not really), Da Andrea. Getting a last-minute reservation is a GREAT underrated feature of NYC restaurants, and Da Andrea is among this categorization. The way that we would describe Da Andrea is: both a great date spot but also a place we would bring our grandparents. Do with that what you will. The host (shout out Sidy) was very enthusiastic, but still told us we had to wait until our reserved time to be seated when we arrived 20 minutes early? The audacity! Nonetheless, when we sat, we were eager for wine AND bread. The bread was good but would have been better warm. As for wine, the cheapest bottle of red checks out!! For food, we started with the tuna tartare --which was decent. VERY fresh, but could have used a bit of flavor. The tomato at the bottom was a surprise and was definitely a grocery store tomato, but we are both used to garden tomatoes as per our Italian heritage, so we are tough critics. The waitress was super sweet and gave us honest advice, which we appreciated greatly. She told Sam to get the cavatelli di ricotta instead of the risotto special --which turned out to be an excellent decision. The pesto it is served with is SPECTACULAR, and the shrimps are deviled and already removed of their tails! Who wants to awkwardly pick the tails off of shrimps anyway? Josie got the Pappardelle, which was classic and surprisingly light. For dessert, we shared the apple crisp and some complementary biscotti and creame. Are we just cool or are complementary biscottis offered to every customer at Italian restaurants? Who knows. The only critique we have is about the portion size --as it was almost too small for our fat asses. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Good starter but nothing to it. For lunch I had the pappardelle with ragu. Unfortunately, the pappardelle needed to be more al dente. Carbonara looked good but too heavy for me. Good meal but not 4.5 stars.

Ashley L.,/user_details?userid=bAmK1OzZpDkKeN_az63sMw,"Jersey City, NJ",8/21/2022,5.0,"I've walked by Da Andrea so many times over the years and finally decided to book a last-minute dinner reservation the other night and I'm glad I did. It's right by the 14th St PATH and Union Square so it's super accessible and easy to find. It has both indoor and outdoor dining options for those that are still excited about al fresco dining experiences. This one, however, has gorgeous flowers all over its awnings outside which just adds to the magic. Da Andrea is a solid Italian spot with a solid spread of both drinks and entrees. Upon arrival, I was able to be sat early, however, my table was outside on a rocky corner which sucked (minus 5), next to a family that parked their stroller so they kept coming by (minus 5) and a pretty high access door to another building that had lots of foot traffic and for some odd reason even though I was sitting in the middle of the city on the literal concrete, it seemed as if there were so many bugs and mosquitos as I was immediately covered in bug bites which was a miserable time (minus 25). However, all those things are not really within the control of the restaurant and I was determined to enjoy my dinner and have a decent time. I started off with the burrata, the black squid ink pasta with clams and tomatoes, and the gnocchi, and wrapped it up with their warm chocolate (walnut) cake and salted ice cream on the side. I also had their spritz and a continuous flow of tap water (their water service was boss). They also brought over two little side dishes of biscotti and some dip on the side that felt like adult dunkaroos which was a nice touch given the awkward seating situation. River, my server, was such a champ and handled everything in stride (especially his sense of humor a la life being a simulation joke), to extra shout-out for the service, and the additional hands that had the water coming (it was so hot out, bless their attentiveness, seriously, my table was never without water). Great service, and solid food, and definitely willing to come back, but will just have to be wary and more vocal about the seating arrangements. 10/10 would recommend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Next, I had the Ravioli di vitello and my friend has the Gnocchetti di patate which were both great. We shared the Involtino di pollo (stuffed chicken breast) which was not my favorite. Lastly, the Triangolo al Cioccolato (chocolate cake) was excellent.

Of all the dishes, I recommend the spinach ravioli, and the pappardelle second. The fettuccine had a rough texture and lacked flavor. The appetizer was also tasty with the thin round breads where we placed the prosciutto, cheese, and veggie inside for a nice bite.

I would say I felt a bit underdressed but nonetheless I had a good time. I would advise making a reservation because it seemed as if my friends and I had not made a reservation we would have been seated somewhere not a pleasant as where we sat. The star was very helpful, I wouldn't say they were super attentive in the beginning but granted we got there at around 3:30 so the after lull was just coming to an end. Our waitress was very helpful in explaining the menu to us. We order the flatbread for the table which that day's special called for cheesy Margherita flatbread *chef's kiss*. My one friend and I proceeded to order the spaghetti alla carbonara and my other friend ordered their cavatelli di ricotta. All was delicious. The cavatelli had pesto and I'm telling you it was blended to perfection. My first time trying pesto could never be beat. 4/5 for the sole reason we didn't get dessert, ... that was until they gave us complementary biscotti cookies with a lovely sweet sauce. 4.5//5, great place for an intimate lunch or date night with you partner",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Like a fancier English muffin for reference lol. Basically, you take the tigelle and throw slices of prosciutto and some cheese and bite. It was delicious! The main course we shared the spaghetti bolognese (spaghetti was so gourmet and sauce was perfectly seasoned) and stuffed chicken with ham, spinach, cheese, and outer puff in a gravy sauce.

I have a service animal which people automatically assume is ""fake"" because I am not deaf or blind or they cannot ""see"" my disability. It is against the law in New York to only allow service animals for the blind or deaf as well. The staff demanded an ID for the dog which does not exist in New York State - I would know I'm a lawyer. I tried to calmly explain this and even showed them the specific law on the government website as well as the requirements which are required I show - which I did. Still, they insisted the manager who was not there, would not allow it. So I had to call 311 who then called the police for me who came and explained the law to them. We were able to sit and have brunch finally. We ordered we were eating slowly and chatting, my service animal sitting right under me not making a sound. Every two minutes staff came and asked us if they can take away our plates which we were clearly still eating. I never felt so rushed and it was as if I was getting kicked out. I would never ever recommend this place until they get some training.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Tiffany A.,/user_details?userid=OIYCSJSc6vvsXOKl4lnhcg,"Queens, NY",4/21/2022,3.0,Came back again this past Easter and was slightly disappointed. I made my reservation through yelp and the yelp notification said that all reservations through yelp would be outside. Given that day was a bit chilly I called the restaurant to see if I'd be able to switch my reservation to be seated indoors. The person that picked up the phone assured me it would be no problem and that my reservation was actually inside anyway. I get to the restaurant and I'm greeted by who I'm assuming is the manager and he started to walk my group to the seating outside. I stopped him and let him know that I had spoke to someone and they assured me that I was being sat inside. He looked at me very confused and said there are no seats and that he would go talk to the woman I spoke to. He comes back to tell me that the hostess claims she never spoke to anyone and never said I was being sat inside????? Safe to say I was pretty annoyed that this person literally lied about speaking to me on the phone but the manager honestly handled it like a champ suddenly found my party a table inside. The restaurant clearly can't function when things get too busy because there was also a celebrity there eating with his family that was also really annoyed about something. Our food took a very long time to come out and since I was already annoyed about the hostess lying  I was pretty disappointed this time around. I still love this place and am thankful for the managers understanding but there definitely needs to be some kind of cap on reservations so that the place doesn't get overwhelmed.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was loud but that's mostly because it was a weekend evening.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Similarly, the pasta special that I ordered was fine aside from the dry tuna pieces, but it didn't taste any better to me than any other pasta with any other pasta sauce.

We had an 8pm reservation, arrived at 7:45. We were told it would be 20 minutes. At exactly 8:05, we were walked through the restaurant and sat at a great table in the rear of the restaurant. That room in the back has about 10 tables and offers a more intimate setting. Immediately, the impeccable service starts, it's a team waiting style with appetizers and drinks taken by one gentleman, main meal and dessert by another. Waters were filled as soon as needed, food delivered quickly and hot. The food is outstanding. We started with the tasty Burrata con  basilico, then ordered the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara and the Pappardelle with a sweet sausage ragout. All were great choices. We had the Tiramisu, which was light and flavorful and the Italian cheesecake which was a light ricotta base with a sweet lemony flavor. One thing you notice is that they train well, work as a team and management has lots of staff on site to get the food prepared and delivered efficiently.

We loved the atmosphere of the restaurant but the service was not great - We waited over an hour to receive our appetizers and the tables who were seated and ordered after us received theirs first. We had to remind our waitress a few times before she brought our dishes out. For our mains, we specifically asked if a dish could be made without pork only to find pork in the dish anyway. We don't eat pork and didn't realize until after taking a first bite which was extremely upsetting. I'm usually very understanding to mishaps - things happen (especially on busy nights), but our waitress didn't seem to be phased in the slightest and offered very minimal apologies or empathy.

It's gets pretty busy after 5pm so if you don't like small places with lots of people, either come early or sit outside. The waiters were pretty nice people.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Then COVID. But I don't think anything could diminish the experience of dining here -- or taking their cooking home. I love what they've done to the street with their outdoor space.  And they are super careful about checking vaccination proof, which makes me feel good about eating inside as well. Oh, and the food: I have never been disappointed! Between family and friends' visits (or takeout) we must have gone through the entire menu a few times by now. All I can say is that after each meal I say to myself ""that's my favorite""!  The service is warm and gracious, they happily substitute pastas if you're craving a different combination, their wine list is solid and unpretentious.  I'm very grateful for my neighborhood restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They don't allow for substitutions, however. Also, we asked the hostess for outdoor seating. We initially were told that there would be a wait for a table and that the service would be ""slow"" outside because they were short staffed. That didn't really make sense to us, though, since most people wanted to be outside, too. (It was a gorgeous day for a Sunday brunch.) We said that we'd wait and wound up being seated outside a few minutes after.

Natasha J.,/user_details?userid=6BZ_cPNFYLgrjCddjyVJbQ,"Brooklyn, NY",12/9/2022,1.0,"This review is for POC bc this restaurant is racist (they'll probably be happy to have only white people at their establishment). So when everyone in the party (we had a reservation), this Indian host ignores me(despite eye contact), goes past to 3 white people who did not have a reservation to ask where they wanted to sit. They said inside because it was cold and I had to chase him down even though he saw me and he forced us to sit outside and did not give us an option. They then refused to turn our overhead heater on even though we were by the sliding door. We looked up and every single other tables heaters (white ppl) were on. When one friend ordered dessert, two others ordered second drinks. The dessert came and was eaten and we were waiting, the waiter came by and we asked to cancel the drinks. He said ok. He then proceeded to bring the drinks(by that time unappetizing) close to 35 minutes later and charged us. One friend used her credit card and he ignored the rest of us (she paid the whole bill) which is just a weird move for a waiter but unsurprising given this establishment. I already know someone's going to say oh well the ppl who own/work there are brown. That doesn't mean they don't have internalized racism and are also anti Black.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

JanElizabeth W.,/user_details?userid=JrWc2fU7yWiG038fHAfNLA,"Pittsburgh, PA",8/28/2022,5.0,"Da Andrea has every reason to be proud of what its chef produces in the kitchen and how its staff represents the restaurant. We had impeccable food that was served with brisk yet attentive politeness on a Friday night when the restaurant was slammed. I was amazed by how smoothly our servers kept things running. There was no lag time in waiting for our food and there was not a moment when anyone we interacted with was anything less than completely gracious. The restaurant itself is in a cozy, attractive space and (on the Friday night we were there, at least) seems to attract a younger crowd that handles themselves with maturity. On the downside, the dining room got VERY loud due to the sheer number of diners, making conversation difficult. My partner, who does a lot of restaurant architecture work, mentioned to me that the walls could have been soundproofed more to absorb some of that noise. Luckily, I was so busy stuffing my face with good food that I wasn't too sad about the lack of conversation. I would love to try Da Andrea again someday during a quieter time slot because it offers an outstanding restaurant experience without the Michelin-star prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Tara G.,/user_details?userid=lQFhTzBF7EIRwlkqVTzNHA,"New York, NY",3/12/2022,3.0,"Come to this place for the food and outdoor setting. Skip for basic customer service and cramped indoor dining. We live nearby and have been a couple times before. When we were sat at a 2-top right near the bar, with the breeze from the door blowing on us and my chair being bumped several times, I didn't bat an eye. When a waiter dropped a glass of wine on the floor and it splashed on my jacket and shoes, I accepted the apology - things happen, right? The easiest thing to do would have been to buy me a drink and no hard feelings. But no, when we got the check not a thing was comped. I'm supposed to pay for the privilege of being bumped and spilled on? When we complained to our waiter he stated he didn't know about it (despite no less than 4 staff members being involved in the cleaning up process). Fine - again, we are native New Yorkers and times are hard, always giving the benefit of the doubt. They come back only to comp my partner's coffee and a dessert we shared, about half the price of 1 drink I ordered. When we were leaving, a manager asked how our meal went, and we honestly relayed our disappointment with the customer service. Not one thing was done to rectify the situation. I feel we have been more than generous in giving chances to this restaurant, but the service is significantly lacking.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

There was nothing in the pasta section of the menu that really stood out to me, which is pretty rare.

The waiters did not make us feel rushed and we sat ate and talked about yester years. I had a glass of wine and really enjoyed the evening. If you are in NY and haven't tried this you may want to give it a try. Especially if you are not looking for over crowded tourist spots. Sorry no pics we were too hungry and in deep conversation.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Adam K.,/user_details?userid=oBki6UEWa-dcJNItLICJ6w,"Chicago, IL",2/10/2020,5.0,The village is chock-full of Italian restaurants. I found this one on a quiet side street on a rainy evening. The soft lighting and well worn interior  was met by a friendly waiter. Sat at a cozy table and had a house wine. The menu has all the usual but the specials were interesting. Had medallions of beef in a mushroom reduction with mash which was well plated  and delicious. The wait staff were friendly and attentive.

Elianny S.,/user_details?userid=N6ueKL89iKXG1i78XKbGdg,"Astoria, NY",1/18/2020,4.0,"I've been here several times and the food here is consistently great, friendly staff and prices are reasonable. This place is always packed even during the weekdays so reservations are recommended or just try to get there early to avoid a long wait. Since my first visit many years ago I always stick to the same order of the pappardelle and house red wine. The flavor of the sauce is delicious and there is a good amount of meat so it's quite hardy. The carbonara pasta is heavier but also delicious if you prefer a creamier white sauce. The grilled octopus is done very well. I tried the cavatelli once and this was the one dish that was unimpressive in my opinion. On my last visit we had the chocolate walnut cake with caramel ice cream and I found the cake to be hard like it was frozen and they didn't thaw it out. It was also lacking in flavor and not worth the extra calories. The portions are generous so I'm usually to stuffed for dessert and based on the chocolate cake I am not missing out on anything special.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

While waiting for dessert that I REALLY didn't have room for, I was presented with two mini biscotti sprinkled with powdered sugar and a sauvignon sauce. Dessert was Panna Cotta. The presentation was super cute but the shape of it made it a little difficult to eat as it kept sliding around on the plate. If you like super sweet desserts, this is the one for you!

When I walked in I was greeted by the owner as who was so kind and hospitable. We had to wait about 10 minutes for our table (as I was a tad bit late to the reservation), but it was no trouble at all as we were able to grab a nice glass of wine at their bar while they were preparing our table. When we sat down at the table, we were immediately approached by the waiter who was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. We ended up having a spinach salad, the special Snapper and the Penne pasta with eggplant. For dessert we were treated with the tiramisu.

The shrimp was delicious, the salmon melted in your mouth. The sauce was amazing. I don't know much about wine but the waiter recommended the Vermentino with this meal and it did not disappoint!

The cacio e Pepe bucatini was essentially a bowl of black pepper with a side of watery pasta- no flavor, barely any cheese, and couldn't eat more than two bites because all you could taste was pepper.

We went again after that and then in 2008-poof!  It was gone. We just assumed it closed at the time. Well, we finally rediscovered the restaurant in it's new location on W13th and we were delighted! The food was delicious! We started with mussels in a scrumptious tomato sauce and we couldn't stop dipping our bread. We also had fresh grilled calamari in a light salad with a lemon dressing and the calamari was grilled to perfection and not chewy. We shared that among the three of us. The bronzini special was light and tasty, our nephew had the gnocchi with a gorgonzola sauce that was the ultimate comfort food-yum! My husband had the zuppa De pesce and it was good but had lots of mussels which he had with the appetizer so it felt a little repetitive but still delicious. Dessert was a delight!  The tiramisu was one of the best we have had and the chocolate cake was also tasty. Cappucinos were nice and we had the house made limoncello which is a nice treat on a warm summer night.

I always thought of this as a sit down fancy place not probably the appropriate place for a quick meal. Last week, I was walking with a friend who suggested we go here because she had heard good things. It was about 5 pm and they were just about to open and there were no other patrons.  Boy am I glad I went. We ordered penne melanzone and artichoke ravioli, both of which turned out to be excellent selections. Some places make the eggplant pasta sauce very greasy. This was perfect.  Bread and olive oil were also tasty. And the service was spectacular. They knew that we only had less than an hour and they made sure that we were done and gone in time for our engagement. Even the chef came out to check on us. We didn't have time for dessert but I would love to go back for a more leisurely meal, Italy style.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Like I said a slightly creative menu, the food was decent lacking in the seasoning department-pepper and such. Besides the duck ravioli the next best thing was the salted caramel gelato. Yum yum.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Gina P.,/user_details?userid=MmtDlVooH64Pb21BHO8asQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/2/2018,3.0,"Nice and cozy space, but food was mediocre. I arrived with a party of four and we left unimpressed by the food. We had the carpaccio di manzo (thinly sliced beef) and calamaretti alla griglia (grilled squid) as starters. The squid was cooked well and it was very tender, which was good. However, both appetizers lacked flavor. Each bite felt as if something was missing, which kept us wondering where the spices were. For our entrees, we had the spaghetti alla chitarra con ragu' bolognese (chitarra spaghetti), stinco di agnello (braised lamb shank), involtino di pollo (stuffed chicken breast), and zuppa di pesce (mixed seafood in a spicy tomato broth). I had the mixed seafood and it is a VERY large dish, so it could definitely be shared with two people. The first couple of bites were good, but I got tired of the flavor after awhile. It was very simple and not ""spicy"" as stated on the menu. The lamb was a great size, very tender, but the sauce was underwhelming and side vegetables were decent. Out of the entrees, the stuffed chicken breast and spaghetti were the best. I haven't had much Italian food, but I imagine this to be more authentic. In terms of service, the waiters were accommodating and we were seated relatively quickly without a reservation. Overall, the food was not as flavorful as it should be, so I don't think I'll be dining there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Based on the reviews from other Yelpers, I ordered the pappardelle with sweet sausage and truffle oil and it was absolutely delicious (thank you guys soooo much). I like to try new things each time I eat somewhere, but if I ever come back here, I'll be really hard pressed not to get this dish again. Loved the truffle oil.

The waiter retrieved the receipt, stood a foot away from our table to look at the tip amount, and thrust the receipt back at us saying we tipped on the card amount and not the total. It took us a second to understand what he was saying because he had just interrupted our conversation and we were kind of caught off guard by his rudeness.

The zuppa de pesce was excellent. My husband had the pork loin special which he really enjoyed. We really enjoyed it and will definitely be back.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/da-andrea-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Joe G.,/user_details?userid=QsHVSZnatCS6nuE9piPjuw,"Orlando, FL",8/30/2015,1.0,"Based on the four star rating, I went here looking forward to some great Italian food. In reality, what I got was a huge disappointment. The pasta was homemade. Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, I prefer my homemade pasta cooked before adding sauce and serving. I love al dente pasta. This was raw and chewy. The pasta was such a distraction, I really can't tell you if the bolognese sauce was good or not. The atmosphere was great and the servers were wonderful. With all the great reviews given to this restaurant, I can only hope that my dish was an exception to there normal quality of food.

If you're looking for straight up delicious Italian food and not looking to pay an arm and a leg, GO HERE. I went with a friend on a Saturday around 8 and the place was popping. We didn't have a res so waited about 15 mins. Well worth it. The interior is rustic, no frills and a little cramped but whatever. They give you this wonderful warm focaccia bread to start. Ordering the main course was tough because there are so many yummy things to choose from. I opted for the pappardelle with the spicy sausage sauce actually due to reading reviews here! Food came out in less than 20 mins and the pasta was as fresh as it gets. And the sauce...oh dear. Too good. My friend got the bolognese and had similar feelings. We also got the tiramisu for dessert - also amazing. I usually don't even order dessert but it was all SO cheap. Even the wine. Think we got a carafe for $27. I can't say enough good things.

Both times I've been here I ordered the papardelle with sausage ragout and truffle oil. OMG: heaven, my favorite dish prepared perfectly. Homemade pasta and the ragout is the best I ever had. The truffle oil is present but not overpowering. Their salads are incredible: including the vegetable tower and grilled calamari with corn, and special salads. I don't even like salad that much but their salad is as good as their pasta. The bread and olive oil is delicious. Their broccoli soup is like eating essence of broccoli: so smooth and delicious, and without cream....amazing. I need to come for dessert.

However, three out of five of our party are Italian. Italians, I have learned, are verrrry picky about eating Italian food in the USA. We showed up a bit before 5 pm when the place hadn't yet opened. The waiters and everyone were very friendly, and allowed my elderly parents to use the bathroom before we went to park the car. The stairs (just a few) leading in to the restaurant were a bit hard for my parents, but not too bad. Had they known there were stairs, they probably would have vetoed the place, though. We would have missed out. We were seated at a pleasant table in the front window, and quickly brought tasty focaccia and bread. The appetizers pleased everyone--grilled squid with a corn salad surprised my uncle (pleasantly). He had thought it would be fried, but he liked it. I had mushrooms with polenta and gorgonzola cheese--delish! My mom had a lentil soup that she said was just perfect--not too tarted up, just tasty and hearty. My dad liked the Caprese salad--fresh mozz with a pesto sauce. The entrees were also hits--the roasted chicken ravioli special, the pappardelle with sausage, the gnocchi with pesto and shrimp, and a grilled shrimp entree. The side of broccoli rabe was fine, nothing mind-blowing. For dessert, we tried the tiramisu (nice) and an apple tart with delicious caramel-y ice cream. With our coffees, they gave tasty little biscotti with a dipping sauce that mystified us. We could not tell WHAT it was. Overall, we were impressed, and very satisfied with our food.

It is not the type of place that is going for that ""wow factor"" by any means, rather, you are coming here for some straight simple home cooked Italian food. You are not exactly being transported to a trattoria in Umbria or some other region of Italy, but you can certainly appreciate the fact that almost all of the pasta is handmade, and the lamb shank that I ordered got the job done as I felt no need to dessert. It also helps that the price is right, but the wine by the glass option left something to be desired (Merlot or Montepulciano for the reds, didn't bother to ask about the whites).
