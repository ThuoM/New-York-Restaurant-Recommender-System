The ambiance is romantic, yet also a place you can go to with friends. They have classics like chicken and eggplant Parm but also a creative side to their menu like a giant truffle and stuffed cheese meatball. I enjoyed every bite of that appetizer meatball and would strongly suggest that everyone try it when you go! The drinks were made to perfection as I had a mango piña colada (different, right?). This is the type of place where you would go on a first date and it won't break the bank but it shows you have class (I saw a couple nearby on a date).

It wasn't too hard to get a resi and I'm sure walks in would have also been fine. They gave some bread (which was very fluffy) with a red sauce. The sauce had a little bit of a red pepper flavor and was slightly sweet, but a delicious pairing with the bread. We got the Burrata Cheese as an appetizer to share which was also great. Then I got the fettuccine Verdi tartufate and my friend got a special they had which was called the mezzi rigatoni. She loved her dish and I also enjoyed mine- it was a little heavy on the cream which I had been warned about. The ambience inside was nice and the servers were very attentive.

Ofelia E.,/user_details?userid=pFvJD_u68-FSvXKnluTDqA,"New York, NY",7/9/2021,4.0,"Went here on a Friday evening with outdoor reservations. To start we ordered the scallops and fried calamari. Scallops were pretty good and cooked perfectly, beautifully plated. Calamari was also tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. For our entrees we got the rib eye steak and sacchetti al peperoncino. Both were pretty good and large enough that we took our leftovers home. Service was a bit slow but it really got bad at the end, after we finished our meal it took us almost 40 mins to get our waiters attention. At that point we didn't have time for dessert and just had to get the check.

They had a reservation available online, and we arrived about 5 minutes early. The hostess got us seated, and we loved the outdoor patio. We started with some cocktails and a bottle of rose, which was a great way to ease into the meal. As far as appetizers, I ordered the burrata cheese for the table, which came with the burrata, roasted tomatoes, gaeta olives, and balsamic pearls with some bread. Very good stuff. My entree was the tortelloni al Pollo which tasted fresh and came with very tender chicken. Sometimes cream-based pastas can feel like an adult mac and cheese, but I can promise you this one many many cuts above. Service was a bit slow at first but it leveled out. They were busy and there is a labor shortage, so I won't subtract any stars for that.

I knew I'd fill up on the complimentary bread as I was eating it (I added olive oil to it, it was delish). By the time my ENORMOUS pizza came I could only eat one slice! The rest was taken home and enjoyed the next day. Blood orange marg was very very very good. I had two! My husband said the filet was 5/5. I'm giving a solid 5 stars for the service. My husband had a coke in a glass and when he picked up the glass the bottom of the glass fell off (like, it just fell off, he didn't bump it or anything lol honestly kind of funny) and Coke went all over the table. So many waiters came over to help clean it up immediately and replace the drink. Really appreciated their service! Super friendly too. Bathroom was clean (but stall is teensy tiny).

Aidan P.,/user_details?userid=8hdm0DyCZZJz2LOBAKpybw,"Orange, CA",9/19/2021,1.0,The seafood pasta was absolutely disgusting. The pasta was way undercooked and the seafood tasted stale and over cooked. It literally tasted like they cooked the seafood days ago then popped it in the microwave and left it in for too long. It just tasted like literal rubber. This place clearly doesn't care about the quality of their food. I'm not super picky but it's clear that they put ZERO effort into this food. I wonder if they taste the things they serve. If they did I'm sure the whole kitchen staff would quit.

We spent about 1000 dollars at La Nonna. The food itself was good but not sure if it was good value in terms of portions for the appetizers. What was upsetting was there was a lot of different tricks to upcharge us despite us already spending a lot of money per person. For example, they ask do you want still or sparkling water? We said still and they added on a $9 bottle of still water when usually you would just assume there would be free tap water. In addition, 20% tip was already pre-added to the bill and they did not mention this. So we ended up tipping an extra 18% on top of the original bill. Overall almost 400 dollars of tips for what should have been a 600 dollar meal. What's insane is that they failed to mention how we overlooked this. Was a good meal if you are super on your toes about not being upcharged, but really left a bad taste in our mouths based on sneaky practices.

How the heck did this get so rancid and poorly cooked ?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Appetizers were fried calamari and a Mozzarella $ Pruiscutto special (fried) both apps were good, not great, but fresh, the calamari only had rings, which normally isn't the case in higher end restaurants, but either way it tasted fresh and wasn't chewy. A few of us ordered the pasta pescatore, was nicely flavored, the tomato sauce was a nice compliment to the seafood, but not a lot of seafood, was expecting more for price. My colleague ordered a risotto with salmon and didn't enjoy it much, the salmon was cut into scallop size pieces, very weird?? All in all a decent meal, but not great.

carol m.,/user_details?userid=nCjy66n1GCLAjpDOekqH1g,"Massapequa, NY",4/4/2021,5.0,"Just finished a wonderful meal at La Nonna.  We were driving my son back to Williamsburg after celebrating Easter with our family in NJ on Saturday.  We had made reservations for 2pm on Easter Sunday for the three of us  and when we arrived we were promptly seated in a lovely outside area that we had requested on our reservation.  The food was truthfully amazing!!! The presentation of all of the food was beautiful, and the flavors of each dish were like little explosions of heaven on your taste buds.  The wait staff was attentive and appropriately engaging and the meal from appetizer and drinks to dessert and coffee was well paced and the three of us were comfortably ready to leave in 90 minutes feeling extremely satisfied with our first ever Easter dinner in a restaurant.  While we didn't sit inside, it was a beautiful setting and clearly set up for social distancing.   As an Italian-American myself, I can tell you that this is a must go to Italian restaurant.  It took the traditional cuisine to the next level and we will most definitely be back there to dine again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great atmosphere, great food and lovely staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jetty C.,/user_details?userid=JZwy2-zvBtWcxUuVQmcQbQ,"New York, NY",10/18/2019,1.0,"I really wanted to rate this place higher since it's located in a chic neighborhood and had nice decor with good music playing in the background. The reason for my two rating is because when my chicken parm order came out, there was a hair on my plate right next to the food. When I pointed out the hair to the server, the first thing that was asked was if I wanted another plate?!?! Seriously? I found that to be a very odd question since it was a hair that definitely wasn't my hair since I just got the food. Then when the server brought it to the waiter's attention, the waiter stopped by and said it looked like an eyelash (gross!). Of course, I asked for a brand new plate, which took a few minutes longer to get. However when the new dish came, the penne wasn't warm enough. I honestly wasn't impressed with the level of service nor the fact that I wasn't offered anything else to offset the inconvenience or the hair near the food either. The food was okay but it's definitely not on my top places to visit again - sorry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Once you walk into this gem, you will notice the high ceilings and amazing decor. You will be greeted by the kindest people in the service industry. The hostess and wait staff are beyond phenomenal - I can't talk any more highly about them - they're simply the best of the best.

From starters to dessert and everything in between - AMAZING. I am so pleased and beyond satisfied every time I eat here. Some of my suggestions for starters: Polpettone di Carne & Burrata Deliziosa. For your main course: Pollo Maltese & Grigliata Mista. And, you can't go wrong with any of their desserts! One thing I would like to mention, listen to their specials! Their specials are beyond amazing and I highly recommend ordering one if it's your first time here. Also, their wine menu is amazing.

We went here because of all of the great feedback we get from friends around the neighborhood. Unfortunately, they didn't prep the table, we didn't have any flatware or proper dinnerware at the table, the staff was sub par, and our server decided to leave half way through service without a word. The drinks were great but my food was ok at best. I lived in Rome for a while so I feel that I know how Italian food should be. That being said, a plate of green fettuccini soaked in truffle oil has never been something I had overseas. It was advertised as a wild mushroom fettuccini but it was really over cooked pasta in a fake truffle sauce. Mushrooms were barely recognizable.

The La Nonna on Bedford that closed down was great, this place doesn't feel the same. The chic dial has been turned up to appear upscale, but it simply isn't.

Perhaps dinner is better in the restaurant but I can't imagine it makes a world of a difference. He ordered the Calamari Marinara with Spaghetti and I ordered Pasta Marinara. While the food was ok.. it was just ok, hardly worth the $21 for the Calamari Marinara and the $14 for penne with marinara.

The service was mostly prompt and the waiter was a nice enough guy. So far so good until we go to pay. I've got a $60 OpenTable reward and the waiter needs to take my iPhone to process it. He brings it back with the screen cracked. The screen was not cracked when I gave it to him. He tries to play it off at first, ""oh it just slipped"" but then comes clean. He says he'll get the manager out. So she comes out. And starts making excuses ""this is why you should've gone inside with him- we can't be responsible for this"" You've got to be fucking kidding me. No apologies, immediately with excuses. That is the definition of TERRIBLE customer service. I get it- accidents can happen. The waiter was rushed and the phone slipped out of his hand. I can live with it.

The food was great but the service was terrible. I understand due to the circumstances of the pandemic, staff may be short and waiting times for drinks, appetizers, and entrees may be a bit longer than usual. However, as the party sat down it would've been nice to have been at least offered water or having been asked for a drink order within the first five to eight minutes. Nonetheless, our waiter could've easily introduced himself and let us know we would have to wait a bit for his service. Still, more than 15 minutes have passed by and we're sitting dry at the table. Finally our waiter, or I thought, comes to offer water and doesn't offer any drinks. You would think a four star restaurant may want to up sell their best wine or offer their unique cocktails but none of that was recommended. My brother & I ordered a bottle of moscato which took longer than I hoped for. Soon we ordered our entrees, that came within reasonable time and it was well worth the wait. My brother ordered the chicken Parmesan with penne and I order the chicken Frances with linguine. Phenomenal food and even better serving portions. Thank you Chef! My brother midway through his first glass didn't like the wine which was noticed by our second waiter (our waiters switched) and recommended a better wine suited for his pallet. After finishing entrees and the wine we were hoping for dessert but wasn't offered any so we decided to go somewhere else. The food and wine spoke for themselves and lived up to the expectation. The service however, had a lot of room to improve on. My brother & I happened to think it was maybe the way were dressed that had something to do with our treatment? Granted, compared to everyone else we were a bit more casual but the service shouldn't change based off these judgements. I've been a waiter before at two well established restaurants and walk in with expectations depending on the restaurant of choice so this experience was disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Prudence C.,/user_details?userid=8DwuciFlGWYiOXBawq0hIA,"Manhattan, NY",11/4/2019,1.0,"We had a reeeally bad experience at La Nonna from beginning to end. I made a 7:30pm reservation for 11 people 6 weeks in advance to celebrate my mom & dad's birthdays with family flying in from out of town. When we arrived we were told the table for us wasn't ready as the party seated there was taking longer than expected. We had to stand there for 30 mins, with 4 very hungry young children, waiting for a different set of tables to be ready for us and were seated about 8pm. Strike 1. I immediately ordered 2 pizzas so we could get some food in the kids asap and those came quite quickly thank god, because we then had to wait for at least 30 mins for the 4 PASTA dishes we ordered to come...it was ridiculous.  No cheese was offered for the pastas, or drink orders retaken. Food was mediocre.  I had called in advance to give a heads up that we would be celebrating two birthdays and that we'd want celebration desserts to come out. Towards the end of the pasta course I sought out someone on the waitstaff to tell them the specific desserts to come out with sparklers in them, and at the same time we asked for the check. The kids were fading fast and we were dying to get out of there.  Then ensued another long wait, where major regret set in about doing a dessert course at all there! The two desserts finally came after my husband had a firm word with our waiter, but then we still had another long wait for the check. Strike 5? I've lost count.  Unfortunately for us gratuity was already included on the check, so we couldn't even tip appropriately for the crap experience.  I guess with a large gratuity guaranteed, there wasn't the incentive to provide good service.  I live across the street, but despite the convenience and the fact that Italian is our favorite food, we will absolutely NEVER dine at La Nonna again. I was embarrassed that I had selected this restaurant for such a big celebration with my whole family that happens only once or twice a year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We know that our relatives and friends will absolutely enjoy the food as much as we did.  We ordered the octoput, eggplant tower, gnocchi, lobster ravioli and steak dishes. For dessert we had the pistachio brulee and tiramisu.   All of them were exceptional and delicious  Afterwards, we took a walk by the water and enjoyed the spectacular view of Manhattan.  All in all, we highly recommend La Nonna if you are going out for a casual dinner or if you want to invite those relatives from Italy out to eat, this is the spot.  They will be very impressed and you will be very glad you took them there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Amazing decor, modern feel with a rustic twist, it has a very comfortable and cozy vibe. Can't go wrong with owners who grew up in Williamsburg, you know you'll be getting quality Italian along with great hospitality. Always a friendly vibe. Keep in mind portions are smaller because you're dining at a higher quality. Great wine selection, I know because I've been in the wine room. Also great for big parties of friends and family. There are 3 different kinds of Italian: 1. Fast Quick Italian dishes 2. Hearty full sized Italian dishes 3. High End Italian dishes, this earns the High End Italian. It doesn't get 5 stars for me because if you want exceptional Italian you can do better, BUT I highly recommend you will not be disappointed.  Also, their desserts are lacking in originality.

Sasha A.,/user_details?userid=7uSUFuSz6ilxcURllgkzyg,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",11/12/2017,5.0,"I had the privilege of randomly walking into la nonna restaurant last Saturday night for dinner. I was walking along Kent ave taking in the smells of restaurants as I passed and la nona definitely lured me in. The restaurant was pretty busy so I opted to sit at the bar as I was by myself.  The bartender was very friendly and attentive and answered all my questions about the menu as I wasn't sure what to order.  The cocktail menu had a lot of tasty looking combinations on there but I ordered a virgin bloody Mary instead, virgin because I'm pregnant . Any other time I would've definitely tried one of their appealing cocktails.  The bloody Mary was very delicious btw! Spicy just how I like it and just a perfect balance of horseradish as I love the crunch it had. Practically a meal in a glass.  For dinner I ordered the salmon with veggies, don't remember the exact mane of the dish as there are a few salmon entrees on the menu. All I know is this was the best tasting salmon I've ever eaten! Seasoned to perfection, cooked amazingly juicy and succulent with the perfect crisp on top. With each bite, I ate slower to fully enjoy all the flavor of the salmon. The dinner also came with a home made bread basket with a to die for red sauce that you dip the bread into. Now I'm not a big bread eater but I finished every last piece of bread in the basket that night.  A couple was sitting at the bar with me and noticed I was kind of dancing in my chair as I ate. They asked me how I liked the food and of course I proceeded to rave about it. It turns out they were actually the owners of la nona, I think their names were Ana and Connor.  I was glad to have met them to let them know how much I was enjoying their establishment.

As a person who loves food and  trying new places I was a little nervous to bring a party of 12 people to La Nonna considering they only had 3 1/2 stars. We arrived at the restaurant, all 12 of us where we were taken into a private little area where a beautiful table was set up. We enjoyed some incredible appetizers that where accommodated in a family-style manner and following that I had one of the best Italian dishes. The food, the service, and atmosphere was all so perfect!! All my guests were raving about the food. Having happy guest made it all worthwhile. There are no doubts in my mind now that la nonna wouldn't stand up to other great restaurants.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jackie S.,/user_details?userid=TF9LPBLQOEmo0SLbqM72sA,"Manhattan, NY",4/29/2016,1.0,I am very confused by other reviews here. We went with my jetlagged in-laws for the first time and ordered a few pizzas to quickly share and I don't think I have ever tasted anything as grotesque or similar to celeste or elios microwaveable pizza since I graduated college over a decade ago. It honestly tasted like someone took rubbery pita bread and put some toppings over it then tried to heat it up. Disgusting. I tried to joke/complain a little to the waiter about it and he ignored me as he was clearly aware of the problem and just could not deal. Worst pizza I've ever had served to me including in airports.

Sabrina S.,/user_details?userid=_Ye99j6n8P8rjO6ucD_evQ,"Brooklyn, NY",12/24/2014,1.0,"Now, I was a HUGE fan of La Nonna when they were on Bedford ave, they made the most delicious pasta dishes ever, absolutely anything you ordered on the menu was fantastic so, for Christmas Eve this year I thought why not try out the new one on Kent... Now I know why everyone should not try it. First, I ordered seafood salad as an appetizer. On the menu it said it had crab, shrimp, calamari and one or two other seafoods I forget, I think one was a mussel and a type of fish. When I got the dish, it was flat out huge chunks of imitation crab and shrimp smaller than your fried rice from the chinese take out spot. The dish was $17. When I complained to the waitress about the crab being imitation she said ""well, we know its imitation but we wouldn't put imitation on the menu because no one would order it then"" I was completely in shock that a waitress would basically say well we know the quality of food we are serving you is horrible and if we were honest about it on the menu no one would ever eat here. I was completely horrified at this point, I almost cried because La Nonna on Bedford was seriously my favorite spot ever and like much of the Williamsburg we all loved 4 years ago, it is now dead. I thought to myself okay well at least I ordered raviolis for an entree and La Nonna always made good home made pasta... WRONG I forgot I had ordered their Christmas Eve special of ""Blue Crab Raviolis with Asparagus in a cognac creme sauce"" What I got looked exactly like and tasted like the seafood raviolis from Trader Joe's... they barely even had crab in them, they actually were filled half with shrimp which was never once mentioned on the menu which is really scary of a restaurant to do when so many people are allergic to shrimp... and of course imitation crab and the best part, they only gave 4 raviolis! 4 SMALL SQUARE RAVIOLIS for $22! At this point, I told the waitress they tasted like Trader Joe's raviolis, the owner of the restaurant came out and instead of apologizing for the insane flip of quality on her food she starts putting the blame on me and arguing with me that ""the only thing she admits is she put imitation crab in everything and at least the shrimp was real in the salad"" The creme sauce never saw cognac, it also tasted like it was from a jar with no flavor and when I mentioned that there was shrimp in the raviolis the waitress started arguing with me, telling me that it probably was ""dungeness crab"" which I am not an idiot, I know what that is and dungeness crab has the exact same texture of any other crab meat, it is not a small pink spiral that tastes like shrimp. It really pissed me off that they kept trying to fool me like I didn't know what real food or any seafood is supposed to taste like. They only shredded one piece of asparagus on the ravioli plate and everyone else's dishes at my table were absolutely pathetic. If you want to spend a ton of money to sit in a pretty spot, have the rudest waitresses and owner who could give a crap about what they put in anyones mouth and get sick, go here, if not, you're better off at the other 200 Italian restaurants in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

For the entree I ordered the sacchetti. The waiter did warn me that it would be spicy but I thought I could handle it. My mistake. It tasted really good but I just wish it were less spicy. That little hiccup didn't even bring down a star though because I was still so content with my appetizers. Also the waitstaff was super.

We got seated quickly and were offered waters right away. I like that the menu had a lot of veggie and vegan options. The Thai iced tea was pretty standard but delicious. I had the Pad See Kao with tofu and vegetables. It was spicy so if you don't like spice make sure you tell the waiter to make it less spicy.

So why did I give it 5 stars? For some reason, their massaman Curry is absolutely delicious. It's probably one of the best I've tasted and I have been all over for Thai food. My wife got the Drunken Noodles which were good, though to me the noodles were on the softer side and the flavor wasn't as bold. Now back to the massaman curry I'm not sure what exactly they put in it to make it stand above the rest. The curry itself is the right amount of thickness with the right amount of peanutty flavor. The soft white rice really compliments the flavor. I really like their use of the roasted cashews, it really brings out the flavor. Other places use roasted peanuts which really don't taste that good. And sometimes just end up soggy. The cashews here really take this dish up a notch. I'll certainly be back for more!

Kimberly K.,/user_details?userid=_qYjW9xj6ndi1puZ6GxQkQ,"Plainview, NY",3/8/2018,4.0,"AH! Thai food is probably my favorite cuisine- either Thai or Korean.. it's always so difficult to choose. But what really stuck out to me about this place is that they have *authentic* dishes that you wouldn't find elsewhere. Also, I found myself not having to pile on an excess amount of spicy sauce as when you opt to order a dish spicy, you are most definitely going to receive it spicy. There was one dish that I couldn't even finish without downing a cup of water in between each bite (but I like experiencing that kind of heat). The ambiance of the restaurant is nothing special, however. Definitely one of those places where you go to catch up with friends for no special occasion. Also, I personally thought it was located in a pretty prime position on a busy street but it is a little easy to miss as it is tucked away between other prominent signs. The servers were super attentive and fast and very helpful when it came to ordering- they were very patient with my friend and I and answered our superfluous amount of questions. The Tom Yom soup is something that I CANNOT get enough of. I even bought multiple bottles of the sauce at home so that I may be able to perfect it myself after many disappointing experiences at multiple Thai restaurants but I could confidently express how much I loved it here. It wasn't excessively salty and lemon-y. The balance between the soup broth with how many/ how long lemongrass was simmered in the broth for was definitely perfected.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/tuk-tuk-long-island-city?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

When people say it's a hidden gem, this is really a ""hidden gem"" because it hides right in the middle of the busy street (Vernon Boulevard). It's hard to find the place because the Tuk Tuk sign was so small hanging sideways and the front banner didn't have the name Tuk Tuk. I told the waiter to make sure they can be easily seen. Anyway, a lunch with my friend went very well. She and I ordered the same green curry with tofu and vegetable. Woohoo! It was so green that I started to envy the color of green. It's the color of the lottery winners of 1.6 billion from the 3 states! So the curry came with soup and rice. The soup was unbelievably tasteful and unbelievably excellent! I forgot to ask what type of soup that is because I was busy talking, of course. They serve us a lunch portion just the right size to hold the tummy till dinner time. The curry they served was truly rich with a pure coconut taste and spicy as per our instructions. I'm not sure what else went into that bowl but I was astounded. I'd definitely recommend the place and hopefully readers can find the restaurant easily, it's next to the bike shop right after you get off the train on Vernon Boulevard. If you're in Manhattan, coming to LIC is not a problem at all, it's the first stop in Queens via the 7 train if you take 7 at Grand Central that's even better because it's only 1 stop, which is less than 5 minutes.

Being a girl from queens I decided to try Tuk Tuk and make the trek from li to see if it was really worth the hype. I did my research and knew what my husband and I should order, and he's glad I did! I got the pad ke mao which is so good I would name my child after it! I don't know how they do it but the flavor starts out subtle but as you're chewing you get a build up of flavors -spice, sweet, tangy - everything that makes Thai food so unique!  I normally don't like shrimp in restaurants but I gobbled up the ones in this dish because they were perfect. I MADE my husband switch from getting a pad Thai to massaman curry and he's a believer! His exact words were ""I'm going to order massaman curry everywhere I go now"". His dish was phenomenal! I hate curries and coconut milk but I couldn't help myself from going back and helping myself to his food (what's mine is yours right married people?). Only downside was portions which I felt were a tad small because an Hour later I was starved.

When the waiter served our table, he told the waiter with good manner. We all thought it was not that serious and just wanna the kitchen aware of it. Surprisingly, the waiter replied so improper; he said they always cook Pad Kee Mao ""like this"" more than once. Personally I would not say he was gentle but a bit aggressive instead.

Ordered pad Thai with shrimp and roti with massaman curry. Came 50minutes later! This place is like two blocks from my apt. Delivery guy decided to help himself with the tip and took it out of the change he gave back. I have him a ""what the hell"" look. Pad Thai came with a really bland soup- soup was a broth soup thickened with flour and flavored with pepper. Tasted just of black pepper. Yuck. Pad Thai portion was half of normal portion for a buck less the price (what the hell). Shouldn't lunch be a better value than dinner? The grossest thing was their roti with the curry. The roti was whatever, slightly on the poly soggy side. The killer was the curry- extremely grossly sweet. Tasted like they used peanut butter and added sugar and spices.. Ugh made my stomach churn.

The vibe is relaxed, the seating spacious, and the service polite. The menu features all the typical Thai fare, but being the adventurous person I am, I ordered the pad thai with chicken. The portions are VERY generous, which is always a plus, and Tuk Tuk certainly knows what makes an excellent pad thai - plenty of crispy peanuts, juicy chicken, and a sweet seasoning punctuated by scallions and mushrooms. The dumplings we ordered for an appetizer were also solid, but nothing groundbreaking.

Actually a delicious unfiltered heavenly sake) then got seaweed salad, chicken bun and shrimp shumai. The seaweed salad was soaked in a unpleasant overpowering dressing that's usually just a footnote with others so the sesame flavor could shine. Then came the shumai which was drenched in sauce and lacking in shrimp flavor. The bun. The bun, it was nicely moist however the chicken wasn't crispy and resembled more of a chicken nugget texture/flavor.

We got the pork gyoza and Shoyu ramen with the works. Hands down one of my top 3 ramen places visited to date. The gyoza was crispy and thin skinned, the shoyu broth gave me chills. It was rich, flavorful and full of umami. The pork belly was full of fat and richness. I never really finish a bowl of ramen and I almost licked my bowl at this place.

This was the only place I knew closeby that allowed dogs as they have a table by the door. Been to this spot numerous times for their ramen and it never disappoints. Love the flavor of their broth and the texture of their noodles!! The customer service at this shop is also phenomenal; the waiter even offered water for Miso! Best part, they have happy hour specials everyday from 3:30pm-7pm!! My boyfriend opted for the Tonkotsu Ramen ($9) and I got 2 pork buns ($8). We also ordered a side of chicken for Miso, which she thoroughly enjoyed. My boyfriend enjoyed his food and I thought the pork buns were delicious and well sized. You also get a cup of cold tea to end your meal which was very refreshing. If you're in the area you should definitely check this shop out!! Great food, atmosphere, customer service and prices!

It was very good and full of flavor. The pork belly was tender and full of flavor. The ambiance is great. The reason why I give it three stars is because the other types of ramen that my GF our family got were not as good. They were eating out of my bowl more than their own.

Andrea W.,/user_details?userid=oqCtfkf3IcwLF7A5iLlxlQ,"San Jose, CA",2/21/2020,3.0,"I came here with a friend on a Friday night around 6PM, and it was already packed! We ended up sitting at the counter which was fine and a bit quieter than probably the rest of the restaurant. We came during happy hour which was great, and I ordered the spicy miso with wavy noodles. The food took a bit of time to arrive, but once it did, it was great! The noodles were perfectly chewy and there was a load of them. The meat wasn't very good though as it was hard, not flavorful, and thick; not the normal chasu. There was quite a bit of it though, four thick pieces. One of them was tender, the way it should be, but the other ones were really hard. It was also quite fatty, which I'm personally not a fan of. The egg was runny and awesome, but it wasn't flavorful enough either. There was one piece of fish cake, and lots of spicy oil. I liked how spicy it was! Service was alright as our waters were filled and dishes were cleared away appropriately. I may come back just for the cheap ramen, as $10.88 post-tax for a bowl of ramen is pretty much unheard of! I was mostly turned off by the pork belly, but maybe I'll try the chicken next time and it'll be better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/zest-ramen-new-york-8?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Andrew D.,/user_details?userid=7IDSxA78pLGWDlf6lPGBCg,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",8/10/2018,4.0,Came here on a Friday night with a couple of friends. It wasn't that packed so we got seated immediately. It is a very dim place but I didn't really mind. We ordered the spicy tonkotsu and spicy miso ramen which were both pretty good. The noodles had a nice chew to them and the sauce stuck to the noodles pretty well. The broth has a nice kick to it so if you're not a fan of spicy things I would avoid that. The pork was soft and broke apart easily and the egg was perfectly cooked. A lot of places don't know how to properly make a soft boiled egg but this place did it well.

I ordered their yuzu salt, tonkotsu ramen and takoyaki for appetizer. Their tonkotsu was rich in flavors and the right amount of fat. Their yuzu broth was out of this world good it was savory and light with a nice hint of yuzu it's a must try. The noodle texture was fantastic, it was nice and chewy. Their appetizer was also very delicious especially their takoyaki. The prices for their ramen ranges from $11 to $12 which is relatively cheap compare to other ramen shops in nyc as well as additional toppings for just $1 to $2 extra! They also offer extra soup for just $5!! And extra noodles for $2! Their prices are unbeatable as well as their ramen broths. I can't wait to come back and try out all their other items on the menu.

Had the Tonkotsu ramen + corn: broth was creamy and the black garlic oil elevated the flavor nicely. I liked that it wasn't overly salty where it could leave you feeling thirsty for a few hours after consumption. The thin noodles had good bite - nobody likes soggy noods, right? Egg was soft boiled perfectly. Pork belly could maybe be charred more so that the less lean pieces wouldn't make you feel as though you were chewing straight up mushy fat. Don't get me wrong, I love me some pork belly, but the three slices I had were basically all fat and no meat.

It was the best time to come and I highly recommend taking advantage of their happy hour deal. For the ramen, it was very filling and the broth was rich. The noodles were also good, along with the bamboo shoots and fish cake. If there's one thing to nitpick is that the pork wasn't as ""melt in your mouth"" type of deal you could get at a different ramen place. It's also a little bit on the salty side, but if you're on the sensitive end of that spectrum I think the spicy versions might help cut through that.

Coming on a weekend was a huge mistake because it was so packed. The storefront is where you would order and pick up your food and drinks and the space was small that everyone was just crowding around; it felt very hectic. There were a lot of tables in the back though, but it is a self service space. My friends and I did have to line up for a while to order, but it did not take too long for our drinks to come out. We got the iced honey lavender latte and it was just ok. It didn't have very strong honey, lavender, or espresso taste. None of the pastries we got were heated up. To be honest, not sure if they would've been willing to do that anyways. The banana bread was dense. The famous cookie was alright, but a little too crispy for my liking. The almond chocolate croissant was perfectly sweet, but it wasn't a light and fluffy croissant..it looked like it was squished and dense.

He was not happy to exchange my order he said no one was complaining before and I explained that I don't really like it. The manager was not professional to handle this situation and said in-front of me to waitress that give her to change but it will be last time second he can't do it ( I understand but I am sorry I didn't like it but don't need to be so rude).

No line, but it took a few minutes for the hostess to come out from inside and seat us. Took seemingly forever for a server to get our orders. The food itself didn't take long to arrive. We actually got our food before we got our coffees for some reason. We thoroughly enjoyed what we had. I ordered the papa's lunch bowl. My wife had the pain perdu and my daughter had a chocolate croissant. Maman is a true French cafe and it showed. Everything was great. Unfortunately, the server disappeared after we got our food and it took forever to get the check. Meanwhile, a long line started to build outside. If not for the slow service, that line would move much quicker.

I'd come years ago when maman had only this location, and it was nice experience then, but the restaurant is seriously understaffed at the moment.  The server, albeit nice, never came to our table without being flagged down or chased after. We had to ask for water twice, as twenty minutes after being seated we didn't even get tap water, just empty glasses.  We weren't the only ones waiting for service either. Other customers at different tables kept standing and looking around, waiting to tell someone that they wanted to order, or to pay, or to make corrections to their meals. The eggs ratatouille was good and the decor is pretty. The pistachio chocolate croissant was a bit too sweet and soft, the cortado too bitter. Overall I would not recommend sitting down for a meal.

They took it back and then a few minutes later brought a new one with an apology--but this time it was missing the cheese and the egg was even runnier! She didn't send it back again, just ate what she could. My salad with kale and rosemary grilled chicken was delicious and my sister's egg hash and potato was also very good. So it was mixed for us.

I got the PLT sandwich, which is pastrami, machego (I subbed for feta), tomatoes, pickled onions, mixed greens and a wasabi Russian dressing on ciabatta. It was delicious. Flavorful is an understatement. It is quite large, so you can definitely share for lunch, but my friend ended up getting the mamans breakfast sandwich which was good, but I liked mine better. Hers had homemade bacon jam, fresh avocado, roasted tomatoes and a fried egg on a focaccia bun. We both had bellinis which in my own opinion is hard to screw up.

Renee W.,/user_details?userid=sPIjuUE7u1gWZ5XbUBzbug,"Jersey City, NJ",6/15/2021,4.0,"A solid 4 stars! I came here for brunch and decided to try a few things off the menu. The breakfast sandwich was pretty good. I especially liked the bacon jam. The only thing I thought could have made it better was using a softer bread like a brioche or something, other than it was really good. I also tried their famous nutty chocolate chip cookie, which was pretty decent. It tasted good for a chocolate chip cookie. Not amazing and definitely didn't have the wow factor that I was looking for but it was a pretty good cookie, especially when warmed. The pistachio loaf cake is a hard pass. I love all things pistachio and this cake did not taste much like pistachio. It tasted more like a regular sweet loaf cake and the icing did not taste good. The real star of the show was definitely the pistachio and chocolate croissant. It was so AMAZING. I loved every bite and found myself wishing I had bought another one. You must get this if you go here. 10/10 would recommend!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/maman-new-york-22?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I would like to go back and try their pumpkin bread and some of their other food items. There is a seating area in the back. It is super cute and cozy. It has the exposed painted brick, cute hanging lights, etc. It has a great vibe to it. It's a great place to go with a friend for coffee/lunch or even just read a book while you sip your drink.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/maman-new-york-22?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was around noon on a weekend and the place was pretty much full. I liked how the place offered about equal amount of seating for people with takeouts from their coffeeshop counter and those dining in. Although they had a relatively spacious area in the back, it still wasn't enough during the weekend - one group of customers in particular hogged all the seats so there weren't enough seatings, even though I saw some empty area in one of their big tables. Anyhow, I was lucky to get a counter seat adjacent to the front window. It didn't look so comfortable when I found the spot, but it was actually nice and cozy and I ended up staying for over an hour. Coffee is great.

Elinor G.,/user_details?userid=SyR0DNf25xBL0V56TIsHTg,"Sedro-Woolley, WA",10/4/2021,1.0,"One of the worst breakfast experiences of my life.  I am an easy to please person in general, but this place ruined my day.  I tried to treat myself to a nice meal, ordered the rabbit hole.  The dish makes no sense how it is served it is super difficult to eat, a crusty tough bread bowl essentially which is not at all what I expected from the menu description.  I struggled with a butter knife to even break it into manageable edible bites while I waited for anyone to check on me and how my meal was going.  I needed water, a steak knife, and a different salad dressing in order to eat my meal.  The salad was drenched in a sickeningly sweet dressing.  I can't have that much sugar for health reasons so I asked for a different salad.  They brought me another dressing, also super sweet.  No salad. Had to walk to the counter to ask for new salad.  Then realized the dressing was also full of sugar.  This whole process took way too long until the bread bowl thing was cold and hard.  I was just over it and knew I still have to go buy breakfast somewhere else.  I asked for a refund on my food because I couldn't eat it.  The manager argued with me and told me they had offered me different dressings so they can't give me a refund.  Ok?  I have worked in many restaurants and I am polite, but in this case I was justified in requesting my money back.  The food was cold and I had terrible service.  And it simply didn't taste good.  That is enough to give any one in customer service the indicator that you need to make it right with the customer. I tried discussing this with the manager and he simply argued with me on every point and refused a refund which is what has forced me to leave this honest review. I don't like resorting to damaging a business reputation and writing reviews is an absolute last resort.  I always try to resolve it first in a calm and reasonable manner if something is actually wrong.  Every other restaurant I have worked in or been to is quick to respond to customer complaints and make it right as that is the best way to run a business and earn respect and even earn back a customer you would have lost.  Very disappointed and terrible way to start my day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/maman-new-york-22?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Toyotomi Shibayoshi will judge since it is he and the Shogunate who decides if things are worthy of greatness. Upon entering the establishment Toyotomi was indeed pleased with smell of baked goods, the  sights do justice as well to blend the experience to your senses. Many options were in sight for the Shogun to  choose from, almond croissants , homemade Oreo, a white chocolate blueberry lavender loaf, a chai spice beignet, all looked tasty and worthy of a battle on the plains of snacking. But ultimately Toyotomi was here for the Nutty Chocolate Chip Cookie . The stage was set for a full on flavor battle here in SoHo. The Shogun went to the counter and ordered the cookie... The lady shopkeeper asked only One......, Toyotomi Shibayoshi likes this reply, make that Two kind miss. Cookies were gathered and put in a small bag and placed for the Shogun on the counter. Toyotomi Shibayoshi handed the lady a card which has many monies on it to pay for the services.. Toyotomi Shibayoshi leaves the 20% tip, for her quick hands on cookie approach. With bag in hand of one his trusted vassals the Shogun stops for a quick pic inside. More pictures would have been taken but the excitement had the Shogun ready for battle. Outside the Shogun takes his first bite...... after smelling the appealing scent of the cookie.  The moment of truth...................  It is as if for a moment you have transcended time and flavor, then your taste buds snap you back to reality for the indulgence of the Ambrosia you have just put in your mouth. The Shogun slowly eats his prize, this is a battle of taste that must last as long as it can. Heavenly deliciousness given from the Gods of Snacking have bestowed upon a mortal for a moment whaat it would be like to fly among the heavens. Yus you mere mortals, IT IS THAT GOOD. The Shogun of Snaxx, Toyotomi Shibayoshi declares here and now that this is the finest cookie in the land that he has tasted.  The Shogunate awards Maman of SoHo New York City the only 6 Katanas out of 5 on the Imperial Shogun Scale. Yus a 6 Katanas score... unbelievable flavor has risen up to push the scale overboard.

I love the interior of the cafe, a cute rustic design. The place isn't big but my girlfriend and I came when there wasn't many customers. I ordered an iced americano and a chunky monkey brioche. We enjoyed the chunk monkey brioche a lot. I actually like brioche bun to begin with. It has chocolate chunks and mashed banana inside topped with caramelized walnuts. Altogether, it was not too sweet and the bread was very soft. My girlfriend ordered a quiche with ham. It was also very good with a generous amount of ham. As for drink she had an iced matcha late with soy milk. She enjoyed it. Overall, it was a very cute cafe, I will definitely come back here when I have a chance.

When I came today, the man at the cashier was extremely rude and laughing. He not only didn't help me with my order, but also he made fun of me, especially with other customers behind me. In addition, my drink tasted especially thick - I think he used almond milk or soy milk in place of regular milk even though I didn't ask for it. Lastly, the back room (where customers can go to sit and enjoy themselves) was completely messy, with other customer's old and half eaten things on the table.

Cynthia Y.,/user_details?userid=9JPXARHh9_HlNKVKX_UvFg,"Franklin Square, NY",3/3/2019,3.0,"This location needs to work on the execution of their ordering process. When you walk in, you see the counter, menu and some baked breads, pastries, and such. The cashier is to the side, where the narrow hallway is. My friend and I walk in, and wait by the cashier bc we were only getting drinks. The cashier (Indian female) took a customer who just walked in the door after us, first, and then told me to move (so rude). A tall gentleman working in the back saw her rudeness and asked if he can help us. (He gets 5 stars for service). We order 2 lavender hot chocolates with coconut milk. While waiting to pay, the same female cashier told me to move again, like where do you want me to stand? I'm not SpiderMan, I can't jump on the wall and hang out there. The place was very packed and there were no empty tables in the back either so we took it to go. The hot chocolate is very rich and good, the lavender aspect is basically some dried edible lavender buds, which is fragrant at first, but after a while becomes too overwhelming. I would skip the lavender next time, as I ended up having to spit out (ladylike I know) all the lavender buds into a napkin because I couldn't stand it any longer. The cups are cutely designed and aesthetically pleasing. They should move the cash register to the front, and have people wait on the side for their order. The system they have now definitely is confusing and everyone is cramped in a tiny little space (fire hazard).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/maman-new-york-22?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's super cute, totally ig worthy, but still provides the space to actually sit down and eat. I ordered the nutty chocolate chip cookie, which was huge and sooo good. I also got the berry iced tea, which was also amazing, although I was a little alarmed at the giant cup of ice the waitress originally had in her hand. The only reason I knocked off a star is because it's really pricey, and I got a little lost trying to find this place. I paid around $9 for just the cookie and the tea, and the large ice tea was about a grande in Starbucks sizes. Also, I walked into the restaurant section next door, thinking it was the cafe.

Maya E.,/user_details?userid=BtrUXJ2MmLtG_2-KMoJwZQ,"Manhattan, NY",12/15/2018,3.0,"Came here with a friend on a Friday afternoon to grab a quick bite to eat. We ordered the quiche christel ($6.5), the Claudia sandwich ($8), and orange juice & coffee. After ordering, we were confused about the system of the restaurant - we decided to go ahead and seat ourselves. However, when we went to sit down, we were told that part of the restaurant was for dine-in guests only. This was a bit frustrating, as we did not know that this was a possibility when we were ordering at the cafe. Had we known this was an option, we would have opted to ""dine-in"" and order off the menu and have our meal with service included. Luckily, they had other seating available. The ambiance of the restaurant is very cute and quaint, especially the ""dine-in"" area which is very unique. It is basically an antique store at the front and a tiny restaurant in the back. Food was pretty decent and its a good spot to sit and chat or to get some work done. Service could be more polite and they should probably tell their guests the difference between the cafe and the restaurant itself to avoid confusion.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/maman-new-york-22?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The zucchini noodles were refreshing, and I appreciated that they had a creative healthier item on the brunch menu. It actually has grapes and basil leaves, which both meshed really well with the rest of the salad.

Nutty chocolate chip cookie ($3.75) with nutella is not good--do not fall for this as they try to upsell you on the cookies. A bit burnt tasting with more-than-crisp outside. and macadamia nuts taste kind of old. Olive oil loaf cake with grapefruit glaze ($3.50) and white chocolate blueberry lavender cake ($3.50) aimed high and fell flat. Flavors did not come through. Crème brûlée croissant ($3.75) is ultra soft. A little difficult to eat because of how soft it is and how generously they packed in the cream, which is done so by slicing in half and simply piling it up before reassmbling.

The flour and chocolate itself was average, and it is the salted macadamia nuts IN the cookie that sets it worlds apart tbh. Without it, the cookie itself would taste plain and generic. Its the natural fat in the macadamia nuts that gives the cookie all the flavor. I like super dark chocolate chunks, so maybe a more bitter cookie for me. But its hood, a nice mild, sweet and savory cookie with surprisingly generous amounts of macadamia nuts. The nuts don't taste stale, like a lot of store bought macadamia nuts do. $3.75 + tax = $4.08 for a quite big palm sized cookie is worth the calorie and wallet splurge every once in a while.

Huge piece which I couldn't finish. Love the to-go coffee cups with their blue and white toile look. They didn't have a lot of pastry choices when we were there (Sunday at 9:00 a.m.). I ordered the chocolate almond croissant, but it wasn't really a croissant. The consistency was more shortbread like.  Delicious, but not a croissant. It didn't look like the chocolate and plain croissants that were still in the case as we left. Somewhere else on Yelp, you can see a picture of it. My husband wished the quiche was hotter, but the slightly more than room temperature was fine for mine. I also didn't really like the tan cardboard container the quiche came in, but now I'm getting picky. We had the back to ourselves.

Stephanie P.,/user_details?userid=R8skIfMGcMRugWPUR0OBog,"Washington, DC",12/20/2022,5.0,"Glin was very good! Cute spot in Fort Greene that had a good amount of different options. To start we had the curry puffs, seafood salad, and their tom yum soup. All were great. The curry puff had great filling and was nice and flaky. The seafood salad I just loved! It had a nice subtle heat, which I really enjoyed. The tom yum had great flavor, a lot of mushrooms, and was served very hot. For our entrees we got the pad see ew with shrimp, and the massaman curry with chicken. The massaman was very good, although I do wish it was spicier. It was pretty mild in heat, which was a little bit of a disappointment. The pad see ew was alright, and leaned a little drier. I'd probably pass on ordering it when I come back.

When I came last time, it was for taco Tuesday and I definitely thought that this place gave off date night vibes. My bf wanted to take me out for my birthday so I chose Las Santas. I made reservations just in case--I don't think it's necessary to but I don't think we would have gotten the seats we did if I didn't. I liked our seating--we could sit next to each other rather than facing each other. It reminded me of that movie ""Date Night"" with Tiny Fey. Anyway, we were promptly seated. Our server came to take our drink and appetizer orders. I knew there was a drink called Not a Piña Colada but I didn't see it listed--it turns out that they took it off the menu but they still made it for my bf. I got the Rosada Negra--it's frozen and delicious (after taking a sip of my bf's drink, I decided to get one for myself). For appetizers, we got the chips and salsa and coconut shrimp. I like that they give a variety of salsas and the chips were not too salty. My bf was all over the coconut shrimp. For entrees, I got the churrasco with yucca fries and avocado salad and he got the salmon with truffle mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes and Okinawa mashed purple potatoes. My steak was cooked perfectly and the salmon was really good.

The pickled onions and jalapeños on top were the perfect flavor. We had the chorizo on the side for my husband, and he ate it all. There's no kids menu, but the setting is completely appropriate for kids, as long as they are pretty mellow. Mine is used to restaurants, so he was good to go. He had the cheese quesadilla, which came with some beans inside and was really delicious.

Food was tasty but didn't feel worth what I paid in my opinion. The burrito says ""$16"", but then you have to pay an extra $6-8 to add meat, so I expected a lot out of this burrito. All that for a burrito, I still ordered it hoping I would be overstuffed but it was much smaller than I expected, like the size of a wrap. What I especially didn't like was after paying $22, I asked if I could have any sort of hot sauce/salsa for the burrito, as most places automatically serve, they charged extra for that too!

The location is great and central to transportation and the space is nice   If you're looking to have drinks for happy hour this is your spot. If you're looking to have dinner this is not your place. The guacamole was cold and pre made looked more like a mousse or something you buy prepackaged in a store than something that is made in house for a Mexican themed restaurant. The sangria was watery and had more ice than sangria the liquor was almost non existent in the pitcher ($45) definitely not worth the price for the quality that was served.

Guac was great, and they even give you fresh jalapeños so you can control spice level. Queso was delicious, huge chunks of chorizo and great flavor. It can get a bit tough to get a good dip as chips tend to break and cheese sticks together so you'll want to have fork and knife handy. Then I tried the cucumber mezcal which was even better than the mule. Super refreshing taste. Finally the star of the meal was the fajitas.

This restaurant is bigger than you think can easily sit 50+people. The complimentary salsa and chips was delicious. The chips were freshly made and their homemade salsa had a roasted flavor. The vampiro Tostada was delicious filled with an ample portion of charred steak. I just wished for its price it was two. The steak was well seasoned and juicy. The guacamole was fresh however,  I prefer my guacamole to be mashed not chunky. The guacamole had a nice zesty flavor from the lime juice. My best friend said the chicken quesadilla was good and that avocado crema ?? (light green sauce) was really good. I added that on top of my steak. I ordered the Paloma which was made with fresh grapefruit juice. This drink was so refreshing and had the right amount of tequila.

Erica G.,/user_details?userid=rXkHN3upJNVPiG9yJjytaw,"Brooklyn, NY",2/24/2020,3.0,"Came here for Sunday brunch with some friends for my husbands birthday. We were surprised to find how empty the restaurant was for that time slot... Including ourselves, there was only one other table of guest. First I want to say that the service was good and the overall decor and cleanliness were nice. However the food on the other hand was a little lackluster. Our bowl of guac which was $13 (a little pricy even for NY standards) was 75% tomatoes and onions. There was barely ANY actual avocado! I reminded me more of a salsa than a guacamole. That is NOT acceptable in the slightest especially for how much they charged! I have honestly never experienced a restaurant to be that cheap with their guacamole. For entrees two people order tacos and the other two ordered quesadillas, both of which were bland. I was able to taste more cheese than actual steak in my quesadillas :( Overall I wouldn't come back as there are tons of better Mexican restaurants in NYC.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/las-santas-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Which then I asked, is it the same price? How much will that be for 50 people? (Thinking there might be a price variance given that there are less people) which he then answered ""I already told you it's 35!"" And remarked something in Chinese thereafter. What comes next? He hangs up. Given that this place gives an elevated dim sum experience compared to its China town counterparts like jing fong or golden unicorn, the communication and public relations are sub par compared to the latter mentioned.

Food is an A+, service is an A+, interior design A+ and pricing A+. Xu's Public House is a hybrid between Chinese traditional dishes such as dim sum and soup dumplings, with an American flare. So far I've been here twice (once for lunch and once for dinner) and each time, I try to order something different since their menu is bountiful. I really enjoyed their truffle dumplings, porn buns and dim sum items. When you come for dinner, they provide you with complimentary Hong Kong cakes to start!

Immediately you can tell from the decor and setting at Xu's, the owner's  ambition for an Asian-inspired fine dining experience. Overall, the atmosphere is amazing. For food, we ordered BBQ pork bun, fried wonton for starters and they didn't let us down, especially the BBQ pork bun, you can feel the layers of flavors gradually build in as the pork melts in your mouth. For main course we had King Crab cold noodle with sea urchin-- a taste of summer, I'd say, which reminds me of the good old days by the sea. We also had soup and sea urchin steamed egg, etc. For service, the waiters are very nice but kinda of lack experience, which shall be improved with time.

You can tell that the place is trying to be upscale but it lacks attention to details. Examples include the rest room is super dirty, the tea cup they gave to us was broken and filled with dirty cleaning water. Servers are nice but you can clearly tell that they are inexperience as I have to raise my hand for more than 30 seconds for them to notice me. Service is extremely slow. We didn't order much but we ended up spending two hours here for lunch, mostly waiting for food. This is very surprising as the restaurant doesn't seem to be that busy with plenty of empty seats. The foods are just ok, and definitely not worth it considering the wait time. The pork bun is not as good as the ones at Tom Ho Wan. The soup inside Shanghai Soup dumplings is really good but one of our friends from Shanghai said the meat is too lean. She has had better ones in flushing.

The flavors of the food blew our minds, because the attention to detail and quality ingredients really shows. Not sure where to start because everything we had was amazing. My favorite dishes were the uni pastry (buttery uni topped onto a sweet flaky layered pastry) and Orange shrimp (crispy and huge shrimps with a tasty orange sauce). We also loved the Yangchow fried rice. It's made steamed instead of being cooked in a rice cooker which maintains the natural shape and flavors  of rice. This is just an example of how the extra time they put into the quality of the food really pays off. Other things to mention that we're top of the line - steamed egg topped w caviar, tiger prawn and lobster risotto, morchella esuelenta soup dumpling, squid ink shrimp dumplings, five elements tea.

I got the chicken wings appetizer as my entree and was very full! They give you 4 huge pieces that are perfectly crispy, juicy, and flavorful alongside little pickled radish and dill leaves. Pretty expensive in my opinion but overall, a great upscale Korean restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nowon-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'd definitely come back and order more off the menu",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nowon-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

If I knew they were smaller portions I would've rather ordered the dishes individually. We also got rushed out after 90 minutes since someone else had reservations but we weren't told there would be a time limit when we sat. The burger was salty yet again.

Sebastian H.,/user_details?userid=6qZBWG97olYq6HIwIzIj3Q,"Kearny, NJ",8/25/2020,4.0,"3.75 Had this place on the list for a short while due to the IG posts my lady has been sending me. We also pass it every time we are in the East Village. We just decided to go for it. Service is very friendly. I think the selection of classic Hip-Hop (Wu-Tang, DMX, Lox, etc) earns an automatic point! I was loving it. We started with the chopped cheese rice cakes and the wings. The rice cakes, while not reminiscent of chopped cheese (at least to me), were still delicious. The wings were crunchy and pretty tasty, but an order of 6 (really 6 halves) for $20 is very pricey. We also got the chicken sandwich and the burger. The burger was good but not great. My gf and I had split opinions on the chicken sandwich. She though it was ok and I thought it was really good. She wishes they used thigh instead of breast (an opinion I am not at all mad at). I will say the breast was still very juicy and I thought the sandwich had great flavor. The cocktail list is very limited and also a little on the pricey side. The vibe here is cool and it's a place I would love to come back to once indoor dining resumes (hopefully ASAP!). If you are in the East Village I would recommend you stop in for a bite (or two).

Sometimes its those little things.  I hope to be able to dine there again to support them, I know they are doing great work :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nowon-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Sandy F.,/user_details?userid=hcU4wVRmaktlCNQCMCKtkA,"Manhattan, NY",5/1/2022,2.0,Had pretty high expectations of this place since it garnered high reviews but must say was pretty much disappointed. We got the octopus and soy chicken wings as appetizers. The octopus was two small skewers and rubbery. I didn't even want to finish my small piece. The wings were small and nothing spectacular. Go to turntable for real wings. We got the dry aged burger and honey butter tater tot's. These took almost 40 mins to arrive after we finished the apps. And then the burger was cold. Probably sat out for 5-10 minutes before someone realized to push out the order. The burger was small and had no flavor and no other condiments other than the spicy mayo. For a $24 burger you expect it to be somewhat good and larger. It does not come with any fries or tots which you order separately. The tots tasted like frozen and the honey butte flavor was a bit overpowering. To summarize there are way better spots to spend your money and to get Korean gastopub experience and food.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/nowon-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jin C.,/user_details?userid=9G8EyOAEv5mfSOdsbrIF7A,"New York, NY",9/26/2020,3.0,"Nowon is a buzzy kind of place whose reputation allows it to upcharge just a little more and demand that you buy a meal's worth of food if you wish to hang out there for 1.5 hours. As a result, I got to sample a variety of food I probably wouldn't have otherwise. The food here is mostly korean bar food, so don't expect health. I had the pickles, the kimbap, honey butter tater tots, kimchi burrata and the charred broccolini salad. The kimchi burrata was an unexpectedly delicious combination. The honey butter tater tots were tasty but it's hard to mess up deep fried carbs. The kimbap is not worth getting at all. It's fine but not great. I probably would have more to rave about if I ordered less healthy things like burgers or wings, but other people have already done that for me.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/nowon-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This restaurant has the worst customer service I have ever seen. I made a reservation for 5:30pm (NOT a popular time) the morning of (so clearly this was not a reservation that people were trying to make since it was available that morning) and when I was unable to attend my reservation because I was asleep sick in bed and worried I might have COVID, the restaurant charged me $40 ($20 pp). I attempted to cancel the reservation on Resy and it did not give me the option to and said I could not cancel within 24 hrs even though the reservation was made less than 24 hrs before the time of the reservation. I emailed the restaurant to explain the situation and they were very rude and said they were still charging me despite my covid concerns. Most gyms and restaurants are being extremely cautious and understanding of cancellations due to covid but this restaurant was so rude and strictly adhering to their policy despite these unusual times.

The chopped cheese rice cakes were delicious, couldn't have been better. The burger was fantastic, I would put it on par with Emily/Emmy Squared. The tots were just normal tater tots drenched, and I mean drenched in butter, avoid at all costs. The cucumber salad starter was devoid of flavor and I wouldn't recommend. Service was fine, atmosphere fine, though there was a table with several children sitting next to us for a 9:30pm reservation on a Friday night.

An appetizer I highly recommend trying is the eggplant parm. It doesn't even taste like eggplant in a good way and the sauce that comes with it is delicious.

Cute resturant ambiance, and the waiter was super kind. However, the food wasn't too great, I got the parpardelle with their version of vodka sauce, and unfortunately it was so extremely salty I couldn't get through half of it. Additionally, we got the garlic bread and antipasto as appetizers, and unfortunately both were very anticlimactic. The garlic bread was unfortunately inedible, I wasn't even sure what it tasted it. Lastly, the rose was affordable, but tasted so awful I didn't finish half a glass.

Showed up shortly after they opened the staff told me they were only seating by reservations even tho their website says they only take reservations for 6 or more people. They said it was due to them being understaffed. Three staff members were sitting outside vaping. So clearly they were not understaffed. The couple behind me were sat even tho they did not have a reservation. I was also a party of two like them.

Our server was super nice and attentive. The food was fantastic! I got a rigatoni bolognese which tastes pretty good and the spaghetti alla Norma was the best (recommend).

Ellie Z.,/user_details?userid=XLL4QC206Ljm56d3FlDH2A,"Ithaca, NY",7/2/2022,5.0,"San Marzano is a must-try restaurant for everyone in NYC. Great food, great prices, great staff, what more could you ask for? I went this past weekend and got the bottomless mimosas for $12 (nearly unheard of in the city), chicken panini, and delicious pasta. I absolutely loved the food. We ordered the Boar Ragu Tagliatelle which was phenomenal. The pasta was al dente, the ragu sauce was perfectly seasoned and was so worth it for the price. We were scraping the bowl at the end. The chicken panini was also amazing; the flavors perfectly complemented each other and the baguette was nice and crunchy. I did find that occasionally the chicken was a little dry/tough. The bottomless mimosas were also extremely delicious; not too strong on the champagne but not pure orange juice as well. Our waitress consistently filled up the mimosas and we were never waiting around with empty glasses. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a delicious but not too pricy meal.

Ming M.,/user_details?userid=uXvnFP3J8-cfUtKXQD8ZfA,"Southport, Fairfield, CT",2/21/2022,2.0,"We came with a large party for a reservation and that was a mistake. They charge $48 per person to make a reservation, and you get a prix fixe menus which ended up being around $60 with tax and tip. With this comes a pasta dish, 3 appetizers, bread, and unlimited beer/wine/sangria. This sounded like a good deal but it definitely was not. If you had just ordered you own separate items it would have been much much cheaper. The portions are small, and the sangria was very watered down and mostly ice. We had 8 people so they gave us 2 of each of the 3 apps. Our waiter didn't bring out our 3rd app, we asked for it, and then he didn't believe us even though there was no 5th/6th plate. And then they only brought us 1 of the last app. This was honestly such a ripoff- you are 100% paying just for the convenience of having the reservation but I would suggest not doing that unless you want to pay 3x the price.

Nicki W.,/user_details?userid=M8kmnsqZd3GN0n3AkD9jDg,"New York, NY",11/9/2021,5.0,Went here for the first time the other night. Heard about this place from my friend Paris who goes all the time. I'm from LA and and wanted somewhere casual and cute to eat. The food was really quality Italian food for the price and the staff was super friendly. Our waitress was chill and helped with the wine menu and the host with the buzzcut was really sweet and recommended the pappardelle with ragu (he told us to add ricotta which was amazing) and we loved it so shout out to him. Definitely will be visiting again next time we're in the city and wanna try the brunch because the hosts sold us on the unlimited mimosas.

Sofia Z.,/user_details?userid=NJB8D-vdbNWssUsWWBY_vA,"Wall Township, NJ",9/26/2021,3.0,"Food is good for the price, and the bottomless brunch price is a steal, however don't come here if you're looking to get drunk/have fun. They don't play music and don't let you get rowdy, and they don't do pitchers of bottomless mimosas. With that, our waiter actually told us we couldn't chug the mimosas at all and purposefully ignored our table and went to others first.... So what's the point of advertising bottomless brunch if it's not really bottomless.

When I called the restaurant the next day to ask for their list of ingredients, I was initially offered that they pay my hospital bill, however later was informed that they could only offer me a ""free glass of wine"" to make up for their mistake. They took no responsibility for their mistake and refused to apologize or show any remorse for my ending up in the hospital with a life threatening reaction. They even went so far as to accuse me of lying- saying that I could have eaten something after I left or maybe I ""kissed someone who ate nuts.""

Homemade, fresh and the taste is great. I have been here twice.

In the OpenTable app there was no information about this. I even tried to reserved a table in the rest. to see if what the waiter was telling was true, and it doesn't say anything. So is a scam. Moreover, my waiter Cade, was kind of rude about it and didn't offered me the choice of no fix menu, until I raised the concern to him and get upset that they were trying to scam me. He forgot about us most of the night, we have to ask to order drinks,  and then it was like we were not there. Not very nice, when I was telling him the truth.

I got the pear and Gorgonzola ravioli and it was soooo good I could eat it every day. My boyfriend got the bolognese and he also loved it. The burrata appetizer is a must! So delicious. I definitely recommend this place to everyone.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-marzano-pasta-fresca-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'm sorry to say it's gone downhill. Mainly becayse they now require parties of 6 or more to order the prix fixe menu, which you don't find out until after you've made the reservation and is a LOT more expensive than ordering ala carte: $45 prix fixe includes 1 main, 3 apps for the table & unlimited house wine or beer vs $11 mains/$9 app/$7 house wine. Luckily, my spouse knows the owner, so we were let off of the expensive option but it left a bad taste of scam. The waitress verged on rude & wasn't the least attentive.

Well, bear with me here because I was also skeptical but proven wrong. Like shut down. Pasta for brunch, with bottomless, is a thing and it rocked my world! It's savory, filling and pretty carb heavy to soak up a hangover or start off a day of boozin lol. Can't ask for much more from brunch right? The pasta here is fantastic, everything is made in house and authentic. I had the papparedelle bolognese which is wide ribboned pasta with veal and pork mixed in a very savory and flavorful sauce. By the end of the meal I was perfectly satisfied, not that overstuffed feeling you sometimes get from pasta, so portions were very appropriate.

The atmosphere is cute and it's a very popular spot so it can get pretty noisy inside. There was no AC even though I went during a heat wave. Prices are reasonable for what you get and quality of food is also what you would expect for the price. Service was pretty average, nothing spectacular.

Shannon M.,/user_details?userid=Hr5Ane5anT-nKxCh6Uq1yw,"Pleasanton, CA",7/14/2019,5.0,Absolute steal! We ordered pasta ($10) and a pitcher of sangria ($15) as well as a salad ($8) which all came out very quickly and with excellent service. Expect to wait up to an hour during their dinner rush unless you're a party of two. The atmosphere was really young however a little loud. The flavors of all the dishes were incredible and it really did taste like homemade pasta done right. We will definitely be coming back next time we're in the city.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-marzano-pasta-fresca-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Chris P.,/user_details?userid=ODiqtfP-ztQdgLGOlGhIog,"San Francisco, CA",10/21/2021,1.0,"This restaurant is such a joke. I would never return here, not even if someone paid me to. It was my friend's 24th birthday and she made a reservation of 7 on the Seated App. When 5 of us arrived, we informed the restaurant that unbeknownst to us, two members would not be showing up. Mind you, we had no idea. Anyhow, instead of being normal or having common decency and courtesy, they scolded us on how they have a $20 fee per no show client. That is ridiculous. I never heard of such a thing. So you want to charge my friend and her guests an extra $40 on her birthday because she had no idea that two of her friends would stand her up last minute?! We went back and forth with a snippy waiter and manager who clearly had poor customer service and racial bias. Initially they refused to waive the fee. We even threatened to leave and the manager said, ""I still have your card on file and will charge you regardless""--mind you, at this point we hadn't even ordered our food yet. Eventually, the manager realized it was her fault and that she made a mistake. She assumed we made the reservation on Open Table, which we did not. We told her, we used the Seated App and that nothing was disclosed about the no show fee and that we weren't even required to put our cards on file--thank God for the Seated app! The manager was upset, but finally apologized for this misunderstanding and did not charge the fee. After all that, they could have given the table something free or some sort of discount if they really knew how to accommodate their guests. Anyways, the food finally came--a required pre-fixed menu, which is almost always a scam. Appetizers were to be shared amongst guests and arrived in tiny portions. All this ""Italian"" place has as entrees is basic pastas, nothing super authentic and limited options. They draw in a young college crowd whose standards are probably too low and who are probably too drunk and not even originally from New York to even know good NYC Italian food. Anyhow, pasta also arrived in an unbelievably small portion and was subpar. My pasta dish was overcooked, watery and needed salt. The birthday girl's dish, in fact, had a hair in it and they had to remake her dish. After all that, they wouldn't even give her a free dessert for her birthday and all of the trouble we went through. We ended up ordering a ""tiramisu"". It was not authentic at all. It was literally tiramisu pudding. It tasted and looked just like whipped cream. I was shocked. Like is the owner a non Italian from some place like Ohio or something ??? What a joke. But, it gets worse. The overpriced bill arrives and they already include an indisputable 20% tip!!!! Of course, we didn't let the birthday girl dish out a cent for this mess. Please be warned to avoid this place! This is not real Italian food. Service sucks. Staff is racist and incompetent. Their ""policies"" suck. It's definitely not worth it to come here at all. I felt so bad for my friend. It was her freaking birthday! Luckily, we all enjoyed one another's company and headed to a comedy club after. There was no way I was going to let her end her birthday night with San Marzano being the last memory. I can't wait to post about this place on my blog and to warn others not to attend.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-marzano-pasta-fresca-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I'm a server myself, so I understand complications but our service was unacceptable. My party made a reservation not realizing that there was a prefixe menu, which was not the problem (we were okay with paying for the experience). However, our interaction with our sever (Mary) made the entire experience very unenjoyable. We made a reservation and when she was explaining the prefixe menu, she mentioned that hosts usually call for reservations explaining the prefixe menu but we never received a call and she made us feel very incompetent because she was annoyed that we had not looked closely at the bottom of our reservation email when she was explaining the prefixe menu. When we asked for the check, we were charged for two bottomless brunches even though we only had one person drinking. She left two mimosa glasses on the table (our mistake for keeping two glasses on the table) but only one person the entire time Wwas ever drinking from the glasses. When we told her, she said to us ""I promise I'm not a d*ck"" and then proceeded to get annoyed at us because she had left two glasses even though we said that only one person was drinking. There were inconsistencies in her explanation for the two bottomless charges because one of the people who ordered bottomless was charged for an iced tea but the other person she believed ordered bottomless was never charged for the coffee that he ordered (even though she refilled the coffee three times). There is also a bit of annoyance because I ordered a meal with a side of fries (believing that it came with no side) and she never told me that the food comes with fries which would've saved us $4 (not much but it's the little things). I understand that there was a lot of confusion, however, she made us feel very incompetent and was not understanding throughout the entire experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-marzano-pasta-fresca-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The atmosphere is charming with mason jars as water glasses and wood tables and accents. The only thing is that this restaurant can get packed! Make sure to grab a table early or make a reservation.

The place is pretty packed and a little loud so maybe not a date / talk spot, but you have to try to Bolognese with the thin ribbon noodle it IS SOOOOO GOOD. You might to consider reservation if you have a large group, but I walked in both times and I got seated immediately. Please check this place out if you are in East Village for some good pasta!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-marzano-pasta-fresca-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Bridgette S.,/user_details?userid=jOwn5a_lSJN93bFmBZlq7g,"New York, NY",3/30/2018,5.0,"I highly recommend this brunch spot in the East Village for a weekend brunch date. The only negative about this place is they don't take reservations from less than 6 and the wait was quite long. We were told we'd wait 20-30 minutes and waited about 50 minutes (not the end of the world, but annoying in the cold with not a lot of room to wait). Once we sat, we were happy with our meal! We were given a communal table & shared a 6-top with another couple and it was fine. We got the bottomless mimosas ($12 pp)  shared the yummy but greasy garlic bread.  My SO ordered the delicious grilled cheese w tomatoes, I got the pappardelle alla norma (eggplant, pesto, tomatoes, cheese) and it was soooooo amazing and delicious for our late lunch, and we were so full upon leaving. I will 100% be back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-marzano-pasta-fresca-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I brought my boyfriend here during date night, and we were satisfied from the moment we walked in, to the moment we walked out. I ordered an appetizer of meatballs which were so soft, and tasty. The bread was delicious as well! You can never have too much bread! For my main course I ordered small cylinder sized pasta with tomato sauce (with extra cheese, you can never have too much cheese) My boyfriend ordered a pasta dish with creamy sauce and he loved it! Anyone looking for a great place to take a date, or your pals, I suggest you come to San Marzano. I'm not sure what I loved more, the tasty food, or the affordable prices. $10 for quality food! And tip these people well, they provide great service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-marzano-pasta-fresca-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Tania P.,/user_details?userid=3DbE0jvcd5LOk5RVPkglEQ,"San Francisco, CA",1/7/2020,1.0,Great pasta if you are willing to wait way past your reservations. We were sat at a table with vents right above us. Our food was cold within seconds. When we politely asked for vent to be turned low our hostess just gave us a smirk. We were told the names were Michael and Michael. I seldom take the time to write a review but feel people should know what they are in for when coming here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/san-marzano-pasta-fresca-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
