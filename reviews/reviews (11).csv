A friend and I ate dinner here and had a small two-person table all to ourselves, nestled along the side of the restaurant among the plants, spaced out from others. There was only a 3-4 minute wait before being seated. Then the service was so quick and everyone made sure to check on us regularly. I started with the crispy vegetable spring rolls and then ordered the crispy seitan as my entree with a Vietnamese iced coffee. Everything was so delicious.

Diggs W.,/user_details?userid=6FBp3yDE8Xop1q6IPtyriQ,"New York, NY",10/10/2022,1.0,"I had an absolutely horrible experience in this establishment recently. I walked in and asked to see a menu. A man rudely told me that there was a menu outside. When I told him that the menu outside was too dimly lit for me to see someone handed him a menu and he threw the menu down on the table in front on front of me. You read that correctly. Instead of putting the menu in my hand he aggressively threw the menu onto the table in front of me.   Without picking up the menu and without saying anything I turned around and left. About a minute later, after I had processed the absolutely incredible rudeness I had just experienced I walked back into the restaurant and asked, ""Why would you throw the menu on the table in front of me like that?"" The guy answered, even more rudely than before, ""That's what I do. I do that to everyone."" At which point I turned and walked out. In shock. Pre-pandemic I had eaten at this restaurant a couple of times. You can be sure that I will NEVER set foot in place again. This was a really terrible, terrible experience. I'm disgusted.

Monissa W.,/user_details?userid=qObxdcgfq-jkKihmcMwJuw,"Brooklyn, NY",5/29/2021,4.0,Pricier than what I'm used to for a Vietnamese spot but I guess I'm paying for the neighborhood prices. There's so much on the menu! The menu in person has a lot more than their online menu on the website. Everything was really tasty and flavorful. Unlike anything I've tasted before. I ordered the grilled slices of Berkshire pork chop and the chicken wings as an app. My friend got the chicken pho and the grilled prawns on skewers on sticks as her app. Her pho bowl was huge! The size of her head. I thought this place would be Americanized because it's the only Vietnamese spot near Clinton hill and fort Greene but everything was mouthwatering and flavorful. The portions are really large too. Enough for it to be 2 meals for me. I took off one star because rice does not come with my dish and was not asked if I wanted any when I ordered.

The veggies that accompany the meat (some pickled, some fresh) afford the opportunity to make lettuce wraps... so I did just that. What a delightful and filling meal! I was really impressed.

I had the papaya salad, the summer rolls, and the grilled beef. The papaya salad was generally fresh but I wish it was a little punchier in flavor. More fish sauce, more tamarind juice, more palm sugar, perhaps? And maybe It tasted a little flat. The summer rolls were rather unwieldy to eat - the skin was too thick, and the insides weren't crisp enough. I had a really refreshing summer roll with a flavorful dipping sauce at Madame Vo recently and the contrast was marked. The grilled beef was not bad, I have no complaints. Overall this is an approachable Thai-ish place and if you don't have a great spice tolerance or if you've never been exposed to funky umami flavors like dried shrimp or assertive spices like bird's eye chili, Mekong BK will be just fine.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mekong-bk-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They did however have a small vegetarian section on their menu so I can't be too upset, as I was able to find something yummy to eat albeit not what I was hoping for.  I had spring rolls over vermicelli with pickled vegetables. It was yummy but the portion size was much smaller than the pho for the same price so I was finished eating long before my companion.  The restaurant itself had a nice atmosphere with many candles and lots of jade plants and other succulents scattered around. They also kept it nice and warm on a cold winters night so that was appreciated. I would definitely go back and see what else they have to offer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mekong-bk-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

He was very rude and condescending, and had little to no interest in being friendly or attentive to our table; he did the absolute bare minimum a server could do. Perhaps this was due to the fact that we're young college students and he expected us to not purchase drinks? But that's no excuse for his standoffish behavior. What makes this worse is that a 20% gratuity is included for parties of 6 or more, regardless of how bad the service may be. Great!

Nathan S.,/user_details?userid=yikgi1FF1FKbiOp_XKQyug,"New York, NY",9/23/2017,2.0,"I'm writing this review because I'm torn. The food at MeKong was pretty tasty. I had the chicken Pho and quite enjoyed the flavor. The other menu items also sounded yummy. My low rating stems from their terrible decision to round the bill. This is the first time I've experienced ""rounding"" on a bill, so I had to look it up to see if it this was an atypical business practice or the new normal. I asked the waitress if she could explain the extra charge on my bill labeled as ""rounding"", and she said that she wasn't sure what it was and would go check. She didn't return after 10 minutes, so I assumed she wasn't actually checking, so I left. It was only a few cents, so I wasn't enraged just curious to learn the logic behind it. After reading some articles about the practice, it seems that some restaurants do it to speed up the change-making process. This small restaurant did indeed have slow service, but I suspect it wasn't because servers were overwhelmed by counting coins. I can't imagine that many sit down restaurants deal with many cash transactions, nevertheless MeKong BK charges a rounding fee. I know that Chipotle was busted for doing this a few years ago and started to round down in favor of the customer, which seems to be the most obvious answer, but for some reason customers are being charged an extra fee for nothing. While it's only a few cents, it's definitely the principle of the matter. It's a shame that I probably won't return to this new restaurant in the neighborhood. MeKong, let me know if you decide to change this policy, and I'll be sure to come back and try the beef bone broth.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mekong-bk-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My drink came out first and it was lovely! It was refreshing and had a great matcha flavor but was also sweet and tart from the honey and citrus. I loved it! And because i was sitting at the counter, I was able to watch how they made my toast! It was literally watching art be made. The bread was thick and fluffy and the strawberry jam and cream cheese combination made for a delicious combo. My neighbor to the right had ordered the adorable cinnamon butter toast and my neighbor to the left had ordered the mentai mayo and those were really pretty works of art as well.

Tina A.,/user_details?userid=UIzCwb08Cyy8sPdaoJo-Vg,"Montville, NJ",9/7/2022,4.0,"I was drawn to Davelle's aesthetic toast from my Instagram feed, but the star of the meal was definitely the uni spaghetti. The sauce is so flavorful, we were savoring every last bite. We also ordered the chicken katsu curry and it was surprisingly better than we expected. The curry has a tiny kick to it that made it so delicious. Of course, we ordered the black sesame and cream cheese toast. Aesthetic and flavor combination are both a 5/5. I was inspired to make my own matcha cream cheese toast at home afterwards. As for drinks, we got the matcha au lait with coffee jelly and black sesame latte. I liked how both of them were lightly sweetened and though I've had better black sesame lattes before, I still enjoyed this one. The space inside is quite tiny, so I wouldn't come here with a large group and you might have to wait.

It's very small inside but I was lucky to snag a seat- however they do takeout as well. I ordered a matcha au lait with coffee jelly that was so refreshing and delish. I also ordered the black sesame and cream cheese toast. It's a thick slice of toast with alternating spreads of black sesame and cream cheese. It was delicious. They had tons of other toast combinations including red bean, and ham and egg. They also serve pasta dishes, like an uni pasta, and other small appetizers. The service is great and the vibes inside the cafe are impeccable.

I had the berry & cream cheese toast, which tasted like literally a piece of plain toasted bread with cream cheese and jam that I'd make at home, just much prettier and arguably slightly more airy bread. I don't know what I expected, though for the price, I was expecting this toast to be one of those thick sweet milk breads (huge fan of those) or to potentially change my life. The interior is tiny and waits can get long if you want to enjoy your toast sitting down. Overall, I'm glad I tried it once and everything was fine, just not quite fitting the hype or the price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/davelle-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Tiffany D.,/user_details?userid=8x-le-zybmav1w5OGvRSmA,"Plano, TX",9/22/2022,5.0,"My friend and I had planned a trip to New York back in April! Thanks to Tik Tok I found Davelle and knew I had to put it on our list of brunch spots. We went on a Saturday afternoon and only had to wait 15 minutes, not bad for a weekend! The restaurant is pretty small but really cute! We were sat at an awkward spot which looked like a refurnished fireplace top. It was just us two so we didn't need much space, but it would have been nice to have one of the tables. We ordered the milky ruby, honey lemon toast, cinnamon butter toast, and the napolitan spaghetti (which I heard was no longer on the menu!!). The milky ruby was super light, refreshing, and sweet! Could not taste the alcohol at all, which in my opinion makes a good drink. The honey lemon toast and cinnamon butter toast were good as well! I usually don't like lemon flavor, but I thoroughly enjoyed it! The cinnamon butter is super simple and classic. As for the napolitan spaghetti, it was excellent! I had forgotten all the ingredients but I know it was one of our favorites! I am sad to hear they no longer sell it! Although Davelle's items are not overly complex, their food design and atmosphere makes this place so unique and classic.

Audrey Y.,/user_details?userid=oHAM6mn4iJUPWB7GnznC6A,"New York, NY",8/29/2022,1.0,"My friend and I have been talking about trying this place out for over a year, but we were quite disappointed with the food. We came on a Monday at 1:30 PM and waited for 20 minutes for a table. We ordered the black sesame toast, karaage, curry, yuzu matcha lemonade, and black sesame latte. The toast was quite a letdown. Personally, I felt like the cream cheese and black sesame jam did not compliment each other and the black sesame was overpowered by the honey used to sweeten it. The karaage was good but not AMAZING. The portion size of the curry was small and the rice was hard. The black sesame latte was okay. Very rich. Overall, we spent quite a lot on this meal considering we weren't even full afterward.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/davelle-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We ordered the mentai spaghetti, berry and cream cheese toast, and black sesame toast. The mentai spaghetti was DELICIOUS. Would highly recommend for anyone that wants a creamy, seafood-y dish. A little salty but nothing crazy (im just very salt conscious). The black sesame toast is a must get for anyone-- perfect texture, not too sweet, and has a very noticeable sesame taste. We also got the matcha honey yuzu lemonade and hojicha tea (iced) with oat milk. Both were delicious-- get the lemonade if you want something citrusy, sweet, and refreshing, and get the hojicha if you want something slightly thicker (almost like a latte consistency) and somewhat sesame-tasting.

The chicken also wasn't that crispy. The sesame latte tasted like an instant sesame soup packet from the Chinese supermarket. Service is horrible too. There was a bar in the side with two seats and there were 3 people in my party. They wouldn't let us all squeeze in that bar with an extra chair because ""it gets too crowded"" but we said we didn't mind but they still wouldn't let us. Not a smart business move, they could have lost a lot of money bcuz we spent like $80 here. We stayed and had to wait another 30 minutes for a table.

Jenny T.,/user_details?userid=RXUkiMpHM4vmdCI-_aOEiA,"Castro Valley, CA",6/3/2022,4.0,"Hole in the wall, Japanese cafe serving mostly toast, curries, and speciality drinks. Have not tried the toast but they do seem to take quite an effort to make aesthetic wise. As a solo diner, I was seated at the bar counter. Seat was a little uncomfortable, hard to sit up on. Ordered a black sesame kinako latte. Was hoping to have latte art as I've seen on other pictures but sadly didn't get one. It was super foamy on top. Taste wise it was pretty good. A less sweeter version of the Chinese black sesame pudding mix. Which I actually love so the drink was a nice surprise. I did see them add the kinako powder in my drink but couldn't taste it. The black sesame is pretty strong taste wise. Near the end of my drink, you can taste the leftover gritty powder. Got quite busy inside, there was only one person serving and hosting customers. He seemed a little overwhelmed. I saw customers coming in and wanting to dine in but it was a full house. Some girls next to me already finished eating and looked like they ready to pay but they didn't call out to the guy and just kept talking.

They currently have indoor and outdoor seating; inside they have around three tables + bar stools and a few tables outside. Clean and calm atmosphere which I really liked! Perfect place to have lunch with your friends. Lots of innovative and aesthetic choices on the menu. I'd love to try their pastas and cocktails. I ordered shabu-shabu salad $13 and hot sencha tea $3,5. The salad was delicious and tea was good. For dessert, I had honey lemon toast $10. I was positively surprised, because not only was it pretty, it also tasted good! Not dry. The staff is nice and positive, despite the fact that they seem to be very busy all the time.

Jonathan D.,/user_details?userid=Co8sEb4m4WKdNkL9l2nEaQ,"New York, NY",12/12/2018,3.0,"Even on a weeknight, this broom closet of a restaurant fills up fast after 7pm. Perhaps the limited space keeps the dinner menu small as well, and one hopes that each dish benefits from the chef's extra attention. My first choices here were solid, but not mind-blowing. The crisp exteriors of the cheese potato croquettes are accompanied by moist interiors. Perhaps too moist in fact, and the cheese flavor is hard to detect. Although a staple dish, the chicken katsu curry arrives with a thoughtful presentation. Again the fry is well done, and the chicken skin adheres well to the meat beneath. Thus it's easy to cut tiny bites with the edge of a spoon (a pet peeve of mine). The first impression of the curry sauce is sweetness, but this is followed by a complex and lingering aftertaste. Overall, it's not the best curry I've had in the city, but it's pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/davelle-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

What Davelle serves up is oden that can make your knees weak, smile ear to ear, and close your eyes while taking in that sweet aroma that dances up to your nostrils while sitting in their quaint low-key restaurant.

The cafe itself is very cozy with limited seating; even though I went when they first opened on a weekday, the place was quickly filled up with people. For party of two, we ordered the mentai mayo toast, berry and cream cheese toast, and a loco moco bowl. The flavor for every dish is very unique and enjoyable, however, the portion size of each dish is honestly on the lighter/smaller end especially considering how much each costs. It was my first time trying mentai toast and I really enjoyed parts of the toast with mentai, but rest of the toast was almost tasteless (would prefer more mayo)! The berry and cream cheese toast had generous amount of housemade jam and cream cheese on it so no complaint there, very sweet and creamy. The loco moco bowl was on the sweeter side for the burger & sauce, but that is not a problem for me personally since I love everything sweet~ the meatloaf burger was tender and juicy, the rice was flavorful, and the bowl tasted really hearty.

I think my favorite was the tomato in the oden set. It was such an interesting flavor and texture that I've never tried anywhere else before. The spaghetti was amazing as well-the waiter advised us to break the egg up and mix it with the noodles to get the full flavor, and it boosted the flavors so much more! Even the potato salad, which I imagined would be very simple, was delicious and so interestingly presented. For so much food, the bill was very modest at the end.

Once the owner arrived, after I'd offered ADA info cards to my waitress and been turned down (""I know the law"" my ass, ma'am), he took my order without even introducing himself, and at no point did anyone make a move to apologize for treating me like an undesirable. Now don't get me wrong, I love feeling like I'm unwelcome in public just as much as the next cripple, but I think in the future I'll take my lunch break somewhere friendlier. I'm sure there's somewhere else in the neighborhood where I can get mediocre food for an extravagant price.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/davelle-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My mom and I went at 8:30 am on a Sunday so there weren't that many people there but no one refilled water, brought sauces, cleaned the table, and the server brought the wrong check.  Also, if you have toast and ask for jam, that's an extra dollar.

The reliable house made ricotta and the truffle fries was the saving grace. They had no Bellini's available and the French dip sandwich was not nice at all. It was cold inside and just fell short. Our server was new but very nice and tried her best and actually the manager removed one sandwich order from the bill which was appreciated. 3.5 stars is what this visit rated  but I gave it 4 stars because they were courteous and this was first day of full dining and because I have been here a handful of times pre-pandemic and had nice experiences.

You then go seat yourself, so it's first come first serve. I ordered a coffee and the ricotta pancakes. Even though I was the 2nd person to order for the day, it took a solid 30 minutes to get my food? Not sure why it took so long. The pancakes themselves were also a bit disappointing unfortunately. Pretty tasteless. The only saving grace was the syrup (which I wish they gave more of). Oh well.

My Big Breakkie was ordered with 2 eggs scrambled, and the they did a terrific job keeping the eggs fluffy and yellow (our friend got 2 eggs poached). The Big Breakkie also comes with these two hash browns which are unusually prepared with seasoning, but still delicious. One of us ordered the Moroccan Scramble, which has a lot of flavor. On the side for the whole table, we ordered Ricotta Pancakes, which turned out to be a real standout. The pancakes were real thick, extra sweetness came from the butter mixed with sugar. The pancakes also proved very filling, so it was necessary for all of us to share them. Service is great and the location has that distinct Greenpoint charm, I definitely recommend this place to anyone exploring this part of Brooklyn.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The food took over an hour to come out and from the very beginning the waiter and hostesss Rachel were extremely unprofessional and rude. After finding hair in our food and them bringing out the wrong food the hostess proceeded to call our entire group cunts and got in our faces we almost thought she was going to hit us.

Rasheedah A.,/user_details?userid=gKuurPSpdKrplvjoHio6zg,"Brooklyn, NY",6/9/2019,5.0,It took me and my friends three weekends to finally get a table at Five leaves..... that's how you know it's that good. Recommendation to get a table is to get there a little before they open as the lines and wait times later in the day can get super long. It's a quaint restaurant in Williamsburg that is really quite tiny in size but their food has big flavor. We had their famous ricotta pancakes and fish burger. The ricotta pancakes are light and fluffy and served with honey comb which adds a whole other dimension of flavor.... to put it simply it'll leave you wanting more. The fish burger was super flavorful and well cooked. Five leaves is definitely a place to visit if you're walking around Williamsburg and looking for something amazing to eat.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

But for some reason it hasn't been the same, I guess due to covid. I ordered the pastrami cured Arctic char. It took a long time to prepare, so I was ready for a lovely meal. But it ended up being three tiny pancakes and an extremely small portion of fish. No egg like it mentioned in the menu. It was overly salty and underwhelming.

Caitlin R.,/user_details?userid=M4MER3UDoDmQ5RQWtfb7TA,"New York, NY",7/12/2019,5.0,Have been wanting to come here for years and decided to pop in on a weekday and was pleasantly surprised to get a table right away as you could sometime be waiting a while. I got an iced coffee and the avocado toast with poached eggs. This may be my favorite avocado toast in the area. It has the perfect touch of crunch and saltiness. I would HIGHLY recommend it.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Nadia M.,/user_details?userid=hgHWYt3HwGOxtd3b63T78Q,"Brooklyn, NY",1/13/2019,5.0,"Brunch is a time to catch up with friends while eating great food on a day I remain indecisive if I want breakfast or lunch. Wake up early or sleep in a bit. Well needless to say I grabbed a bite with one of my favorite Chicago girls. We arrived a bit before noon and we were told that there was a 30-45 minute wait. Ok, no problem. I like shopping so we went in the store next door to browse around and spend some mullah. We came back and were seated right away. So, the biggest con I have for this place is the space. The tables are teeny tiny and there is hardly any space for everything you order. My friend snuck between the two tables to get to her seat. We were approached quickly by our server for our drink orders. I ordered the lemon ginger tea and the turmeric bees knees which was recommended by my server. Turmeric can be very bitter, but this was infused with honey, it was such a good drink. I'm a girl who loves her gin and I dont feel so bad since I'm getting all of the medicinal properties of turmeric. My friend ordered coffee and the drink with mezcal. She said it was really good. We then ordered the daily oysters. We weren't sure if they were going to be worth but they were. They were fresh the mignonette had fine pieces of scallion and there was another red sauce. Oysters were a thumbs up. However, now our table was packed. After the oysters came our entrees. I ordered the Moroccan scramble and my friend ordered the daily quiche. The Moroccan scramble had a lot of middle eastern flavors with sliced jalapeno giving a great punch of spice. I would recommend getting the perfect bite of eggs, sausage, jalapeno, cilantro, chick peas, avocado and toast all in one. The flavors work really well together. The quiche was made with a nice bite of salty ham and potatoes. It was good, no complaints. The side salad was a bit salty. We also had a side of truffle fries that I happen to love and these did not fall short of taste. Overall the, the food was really good. A couple next to us had the ricotta pancakes and she told us how great they were. So I definitely have to come back to grab a bite of them. We ordered another round of drinks and really wanted to sit back and talk crap, but our server asked if we needed anything else and we realize that was our hint to get out. I get it, there was a huge wait by now. So up we went to our next adventure. Everything was pretty good  I just wish there was a bigger space so I could feel comfortable eating without feeling I was going to invade my neighbors space. I guess you cant have everything. At least, everything else was good. I'll definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Unfortunately, the service and food was disappointing. It's a shame because the other times that I've visited this place, I would order the ricotta pancakes and enjoy it! This time I can't say the same because all the food we ordered was given to us in box containers and with plastic utensils. I understand that with COVID-19, restaurants have to take safety precautions with the public, but I honestly think that the food and service is not worth their high prices. There are other restaurants in the same area that provide better food and service.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I have never tried ricotta pancakes or even ricotta itself, so I thought the pancakes would taste a little cheesy XD But the ricotta just made it much fluffier, which you can see in the pictures. There was a huge chunk of honeycomb butter, never heard of it before, but it really enhanced the taste of the pancakes and syrup. It was very filling and I couldn't finish them by myself, so I recommend sharing. They're the best pancakes I've ever had, but I will soon try Clinton St Baking Co and see which are better.

I asked twice and I think the first time they might've forgotten, but we're literally right in front of her (15 min) and had to ask again which she brought it back 5 min later. Was it worth it?

The place was packed - had indoors as well as some outdoor seating. Opted for indoor but the noise level was so high, and it was difficult to even hear each other among the two of us. The seating also is very limited and tight inside because of lack of space.  So we just ordered takeout and went and had in the McCarren park located just diagonally across the red light intersection. Ordered the Black Rice pudding and spicy chicken sandwich which were delicious, and the portions were ample. Black Rice pudding had coconut yogurt, pineapple and basil, a little sweet as expected but was lovely and a good choice. Loved the food so much that I went there next day as it was opening up and had their avocado toast and coffee for breakfast. The toast was so crispy , presented well and was a winner overall. Staff is friendly. Also early in the morning it was a prefect place to just sit outside and watch the outside activity and start the day with such a satisfying toast.

Rebecca S.,/user_details?userid=koVLtX4Ejmw27gRncPe_ng,"Fenway, Boston, MA",3/4/2020,3.0,Okay so first off the food is AMAZING. However. Be prepared to wait a VERY long time for it. I have been here when it's quite and when it's busy and no matter what your food is going to take forever to come out. If you go on the weekends bring a snack because you will wait an hour for a table and over an hour to get your food. Service can be very spotty. BUT everything is delicious. I wish there was a way for them to better their system in the kitchen. Favorite order is hands down eggs and steak. Their steak is about 7$?

Hypno T.,/user_details?userid=iSIrzDdslgciKKKRvHdBDA,"Brooklyn, NY",8/23/2017,2.0,"Probably the most overrated place to eat in Brooklyn. It's not that the food is awful, it's just over priced and over hyped. Sure, eat if it's quiet, but to be honest there's plenty of better food in the area. Service suffers from the typical problem places like this have; snobby staff with elitist attitude. Simple solution is a low tip (because it's not the customer's responsibility to make up for the crap wages 'just because') but it's not worth the trouble. Also the experience is ruined by being 'that place' people recommend to out of towners. Kind of like the old Clinton Street Bakery which was also all hype, average food. Save your time.

Tiffany P.,/user_details?userid=oqinqZf6DGQ4IvD_7wuzNQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/3/2016,3.0,Just got back from Five Leaves. The food was delicious! I had the Big Breakkie and my boyfriend had the burger. I just wish our server Kevin didn't bring us the check before we asked him. Although he assured us that we could take our time with it we felt a bit rushed. A group of people came in during that time so I kind of understand but it could've been handled with a little bit more finesse. Our table was cleared in two minutes and we could barely grab our drinks. This is enough to make us think twice about returning. A shame because the cappuccino was so good!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

David K.,/user_details?userid=_x3aaJ4JH8KwhC0ZYReSBg,"Flushing, Queens, NY",4/19/2019,1.0,I'm not sure if people have the same experience as us. It took over half an hour to receive our food. What was more frustrating was that people around us who ordered the same food after us were being served before us. When we checked up on the status of our food the waitress was unapologetic. Waitress did not come once to check on us. I don't think I will be dining here again. I cautiously say this but maybe we were being discriminated for being Asian because I don't see what reason there was for us such poor service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Only giving four stars because the wait was insane (1 hour for 2 people) but it was well worth it. I got the pancakes and my friend got the avocado toast and we shared the big Brekkie. We were offered bellinis due to our long wait which always puts a smile on my face. we were then seated. Seating is really tight so be sure to leave unnecessary items elsewhere as it can be annoying to walk through. Everything tasted amazing. Food takes a little while but so worth the wait. Definitely a go to if you're in greenpoint.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The tables were so close to each other, my fiancé and I started chatting with other customers - I just wanted to eat my burger. Speaking of the burger, it was alright.

The atmosphere is very nice and the outdoor seating overlooks McCarren Park. The food is very fresh and vegetable focused which is how I like to eat.

We were 4 people and 2 people ordered the Moroccan Scramble and 2 people ordered the Ricotta Pancakes. We also started with the Truffle Fries that were fantastic! Probably the best breakfast I've had. The 2 dishes can definitely be shared. The Ricotta Pancakes were so amazing I almost finished the whole thing. There were 3 layers of fluffy, thick pancakes, blueberries, strawberries and bananas on top with a dollop of honeycomb butter. There were also bananas in between the first and second layer of the pancakes! Served with real maple syrup. The Moroccan Scramble was exceptional and my sister who doesn't eat eggs much, said it was the best dish she's ever had. Delicious hot chocolate, and latte. A MUST GO TO SPOT IF YOURE IN BROOKLYN!!!

So with three debit cards and two cash payments we split the bill in writing on the check and gave it to our server. Two days later the guys who used their cards checked their balances and were MAJORLY OVERCHARGED. One guy asked to pay 20 and was charged 40. Another asked to pay 50 and was charged 60.

Elizabeth C.,/user_details?userid=RuMgAAm1uCSO-Y3itGaItA,"Nashville, TN",11/10/2016,1.0,I'm sure this review won't change a thing about the service here bc there will inevitably be a long wait for brunch on Saturday and Sunday but I think that the people who work here are the absolute rudest servers I've ever encountered. I've lived in Williamsburg for 10 years now and recently moved closer to Five Leaves (a block away) so I was really hoping my previous bad experiences weren't indicative of their overall service but it's really just awful every time. And I don't think any food is good enough to treat people that way.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I was looking for one final NY experience, and I wondered north into Greenpoint, an area I'm not that familiar with. I didn't want a normal boring breakfast. And I spied this place on a cool corner. It was one of the only places open at the time and was packed, but I found a seat at the counter. I thought it might be a run of the mill diner, but the menu was unique. I decided on the Moroccan scramble with sausage and avocado. There was a really cool mix of people from trendy indie types to workers to older French ladies. I also had a delicious glass of fresh orange juice. A lot of people were ordering the sage egg sandwich which also looked great!  It was a Thursday morning, but people were ordering Bloody Mary's and mimosas. I guess they don't have a regular job! What a dream life that would be to not have to go to work, but just go to this place and work on my novel I'd love to write one day! But for now it was a great way to end my trip to NYC!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's the kind of place you get food envy of other diners even when your own meal was amazing. Everything coming out the kitchen looked incredible so I can't wait to go back and try the morrocan scramble. I just had to have the coconut rice pudding with mango and gogi berries for being different and it did not disappoint. The pancakes are huge!

Irene T.,/user_details?userid=nHV9yJzTX6qFDBZ2PM193A,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",3/30/2016,3.0,"I came here to try the ricotta pancakes that so many people were raving about. We arrived on Wednesday noon and the place was still packed. We stayed outside as it was nice and sunny. My friend ordered brûléed grapefruit - a whole grapefruit served in a cup with some burned sugar on top and a mint leaf. She said she liked the flavor but it was really messy to eat. I was really excited about my pancakes. And it looked great, but ultimately I was disappointed. They were very dense and heavy with a huge blob of butter on top; eventually it made me feel like I was carrying stones in my stomach even 3 hours later. Also the portion is way too big, I barely finished 2 out of 3, i think it should be shared. So in the end I enjoyed it but because it made me feel so heavy, I don't think I would ever order it again. I do want to return to try Moroccan scramble and the burger. The service wasn't much either, waitress is way too busy to pay attention to all of her tables.

I have been there dozen of times and loved all my experiences there. Although they have a good variety of dishes, I only ever get few things because they are just the best. 1. Coffee is strong and good. 2. Guinness, good pour, great beer. 3. Big Breakie breakfast with mushrooms and kale. Bacon and steak if I'm feeling extra hungry. 4. Five Leaves cheese burger with truffle fries. This one is a must for burger lovers. (Grass fed beef, beets, pineapple, fried egg, lettuce, onions n tomato). It's huge and full of deliciousness and flavors with every bite. The only problem is figuring out a way to eat it because it's such a hand / mouth full. Make sure you ask for ""5 Leaves burger"" or you will get their regular burger, which is still pretty good but not that Australian style burger.  I also love the mom n pop feel with the owners Jud and Kathern always being around and being awesome.

The mushroom toast was good... however the cut of the toast was too thick (clearly I was too hungover to register that I DID order a toast dish, what the hell did I expect??) Soo yeah that was my own mistake. However, the dish overall was tasty but I wish there were more slices of mushroom in the sauce... but still good nonetheless. I tried the granola and that was amazing! They had a light and airy tasting whipped yogurt with a crunchy and not-too-chewy granola mix. It was perfect and very refreshing with the fruit on top.

Some would give it 4 because of the constant 1-1.5 hour wait but the wait is well worth it. Go take a walk on the east river, have a drink at a bar, or lay out at the park. The menu is pretty unique and not your typical brunch menu items. Everyone is my party was impressed. I'd say the standout dish was the morocan eggs which came layered on a piece of sliced baguette and topped with a handful of cilantro which gave it such a refreshing taste, but one of my favorite little details was the toasted spiced chickpeas. My boyfriend had the eggplant quinoa falafel which was great and it looked like they even made their own flatbread (this should be a go to for vegetarians.) My least favorite dish was actually the one I chose... the kale salad. It looked good when I had seen it at others tables but dressing which was described as an ""anchovy lemon dressing"" tasted more like a chipotle ranch dressing and took away from the fresh/clean feeling of a kale salad. It was good I like the toasted hazelnuts but the dressing was meh. Outside seating is always a plus.

The staff didn't seem very friendly/welcoming and its completely cramped, but those weren't the dealbreakers. The food however, was. We ordered Ricotta Pancakes and the Big Brekkie after reading all the other rave reviews and looking over a somewhat lackluster menu. The pancakes were dry, flavorless and reminded me of a basic dry bisquick pancake. The baked beans and bacon in the big brekkie were undercooked, lacking any flavor accompanied by the hash browns that were a beautiful disappointment. To salvage the meal we focussed on the fruit served with the pancakes and the eggs with the big brekkie.

When we walked into Five Leaves, we felt like we'd stepped into a local joint in an earlier era, and when a couple of guys sauntered in wearing fedoras with dates on their arms, that only reinforced the decade-out-of-joint feeling.  The decor is lovely, from the Edison bulbs and the zinc-covered bar to Louis Armstrong playing on the record player most of the time we were there. Service was prompt and the truffle fries were as delicious as others have described them here (they're like crack; we were instant addicts), as was my tenderly cooked hangar steak and the creamy mashed potatoes, which accompanied it.

The reason why I have it as two stars was because I was expecting it to be sooo good and it wasn't even mediocre. My bf and I had the kale salad, the Moroccan scrambled eggs and the pancakes. The pancakes were alright, the Moroccan scrambled eggs was missing something, but I just couldn't put my finger on it and the kale salad was horrible. If I hadn't had kale salad that was incredible someplace else and tasted kale salad at this place for the first time, then I would never have kale again. Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes.

The space is extremely right. Granted, we expected a wait at any restaurant being Sunday afternoon. The host told us the wait was an hour, so we went to the place across the street since it was bigger and less crowded to get out of waiting in the cold. My friend kept going back to check in on the progress. She even told him 10 more minutes, ""I'm putting a table together for you all."" Which wasn't true/didn't happen. She went from 1 hour to 2 hours. She also failed to mention that brunch was over at 3pm. I only found out because I asked the bartender if we can take a look at the menu to decide what to order before sitting down since we had already waited just over 1 1/2 hrs. Their lunch menu is very limited so we decided to leave. We only went to try this place because of all the hype we heard from word of mouth. We just wish we would've been told when their brunch was over so we could've gone elsewhere.

Everything was very good.  Portions were decent size except for the Sage Scrambled Egg Panini which was smallish.  The Ricotta Pancakes were as good as everyone said they would be.  The honeycomb butter was amazing.  The Mushroom Toast had a generous amount of sautéed maitake mushrooms and kale with a delicious brown wine sauce toppped with a beautifully poached egg.

I must have had about 80 brunches and a few dozen dinners here and I've never had a miss, NEVER in nearly one hundred meals. And the staff is amazingly professional, hip and beautiful but still extremely friendly. The ricotta pancakes can't be passed up (order for the table to share on top of your meals) and the yogurt is shockingly large with the best assortment of fruit I've had anywhere. Their eggs are amazing so big brekkie if you're hungry or the sage panini for light days... and always get a side of avocado, so fresh and perfectly ripe - I'm from Cali so I know. They make it all look so easy, I always leave wanting to come right back :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The outside tables were all filled but there was plenty of room inside.  They played some cool background music (the Youngbloods, jazz, etc).   As our meal progressed, the place began to fill up, and by the time we left it was a packed party vibe.   So, if you like a quieter ambiance, come early!  The service was attentive throughout, though more personal before it got so crowded. While not inexpensive, our food was excellent.  We ordered a grilled fish called dorade, which was succulent and tasty.  Another dish consisting of sautéed ricotta cheese, was also delicious.  The truffle fries were fine, though not necessarily ""to die for"" as some other reviewers have contended.  The server recommended a Riesling wine, which was just right for us. We had to ask for bread, but once we did it was soft, yet crispy and tasty.  The chocolate pecan tart was a wonderful finish to our meal.  A minor complaint was that we ordered an ice tea and twice asked for refills.  We were unaware we'd be charged for three teas.  I would add a fifth star if you don't mind a crowded party scene as the evening progresses, or if you arrive around 5 pm for dinner while it's still calm and peaceful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/five-leaves-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

You can't go wrong with truffle oil. Also, everyone should try the Flash Fried Oysters with smoked chili and cucumber relish - it was to DIE for! I seriously still can't stop thinking about it. They had a variety of drinks to choose from - I liked the spicy bloody mary - it left a tingly feeling on my lips. I wish I had room for dessert though. Overall, my experience was quite yummy.

When the customer at the table next to us asked where her coffee was the waitress cut her off and in a patronizing tone said ""they're making it honey, they're making it."" She'd ordered a coffee when she sat down and had already been served her entree before getting her coffee. The mussels are interesting, but not outstanding like they claim.

Nadya G.,/user_details?userid=tPKMUgQPBTnr0VX2TyH9yA,"Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY",10/27/2012,3.0,"I finally ate brunch here and was really underwhelmed. First of all there are like 5 options..I guess for a place thats known for its brunch I was expecting more and more interesting stuff as well. Inside is extremely loud because dudes are making the loudest ever high brow coffee which you have to shout over ~ i guess people enjoy this charming ""atmosphere"", also extremely small and awkward navigating to the wc...Now to the food. I ordered the moroccan scramble which looked beautiful but was really difficult to eat because it was in a huge unwieldy pile. There was hardly any merguez in it (i think i literally found 2 little crumbs) and the taste was meh. The avacado was in-edibly lemony, the bread was huge and hard to cut through and the raw pepper garnish on top was too fiery for most people i would think. This is a great example of a huge pet peeve of mine: adorable looking food that is impractical as hell to eat and doesn't even taste good. There did not seem to be much quality control happening. My boyfriend got the ""big brekkie"" also pretty, his was a much better because it was simple (toast, bacon, eggs). I saw a lot of people eating the ricotta pancakes ..I guess I would stick tho those.

I didn't wanted pancakes with ricotta I was more intrigued when I thought they were straight up pancakes. Anyways, I spotted somebody with an amazing meal so I had the waitress bring me the same. It was good -- eggs, mushrooms and hash browns (two delish fried hockeypucks of amazing potatoes). I also got a coffee.

I absolutely loved it- you also get a lot, so contrary to what granola might sound like, it is filling.  One of my other favorite breakfast/brunch items is the Big Breaky (sp?)-- eggs any style, very yummy hash browns (almost like potato cakes), and a choice of two sides (I usually go for avocado and roasted tomato). It comes with toast and you have the option of adding some grass fed steak slices, which are delectable. As for lunch or dinner, the Five Leaves burger is awesome! Piled high with pineapple and beet, with grassfed beef. Delectable. The kale salad is also delicious.

So far, I have enjoyed the cozy environs of this new little utopia on five occasions, none of which have disappointed me. I've sampled the roasted beet salad, truffle fries, pumpkin and butternut squash soups (served with crusty rustic rolls from the Sullivan Street Bakery), and the bacon wrapped dates. UH, YUM! My beloved recently indulged in the sage scrambled egg sandwich and declared that Five Leaves would be his new haunt. To boot, Five Leaves serves some of the most flavorful and pleasing coffee around. I could easily fritter away an afternoon sipping one of their cappuccinos and noshing on a roll or laze away a winter evening drinking a glass of their temperanillo and nibbling on some fries.  I will say that I have yet to indulge in a full scale dinner adventure at Five Leaves and I am slightly disappointed by the fact that though their beet root ravioli does look interesting, it is the ONLY vegetarian entree on the menu. Will it kill you to offer something other than pasta? And would it kill you to offer two options?

The fries never arrived.  We both managed to swallow a few spoonfuls and drown our sorrows in our drinks.  The waitress was astonished as to why we hadn't finished our meals.

We both enjoyed the potatoes - they were super crispy and well seasoned and the garlic aioli paired perfectly. The restaurant is decorated very nicely and has a really nice atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I tried most of the appetizers, the black truffle pizza, the scallops, and the Sea Bass. Although each scoop I had was great, I was dying to reorder the Peekytoe Crab Toast and the Long Island Fluke Tartare. There was a sweetness to the crab toast that gave it sweet and savory taste and made me request another round for the table mid-way through the meal. The tartar was also delicious but instead of sweetness, the standout flavor in this dish some tangy citrus. For drinks, I mostly stayed with wine but I do recommend the ginger margarita.

For drinks: although the citrus and sage was too sweet for me, the bell pepper martini was wonderful. My husband also liked the Manhattan.

cece b.,/user_details?userid=x34E9A1g8mH7KhFTWWloHQ,"Manhattan, NY",6/21/2022,3.0,"First off, this place is lovely in terms of atmosphere and overall vibe. The bar area is a great place to have a cocktail or sample some appetizers. Went here one evening to meet up with former colleagues. It was early in the week -perhaps a Tuesday, and the place was packed. We were seated at a table and the room got darker fairly quickly. The crowd was great but it was difficult to talk due to the acoustics. Our drinks took forever to come -and no one really checked in on us while we waited. So, once the server came back we quickly put our order in since service was slow. Our appetizers also took forever, and were tasty but smallish portions. The rest of our food also took forever and a day-and were good but nothing fantastic. One of us in our party wanted to change out their cocktail because it was wrong , and we had to wait and wait again for someone to come by, we finally flagged someone ! Service here is sorely lacking and does not match the prices. If you want to venture in save yourself the wait and grab a drink at the bar and an appetizer. Not sure if this is Michelin star-if so, they(michelin star peeps)  need to revisit that status asap !  :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We loved ABC prior to covid but is sadly not the same now. We received terrible service, the outdoor area was incredibly non pleasing and the food was just not good. The chips and salsa looked like we just bought it from Trader Joe's. Food was not fresh, pretty sure the corn was from a can. Extremely limited menu which is understandable during COVID but still things ran out. We were never offered drink refills and had empty water with no napkins or silverware  for 20+ minutes. Especially at the unreasonably high price point- total disappointment.

Valerie V.,/user_details?userid=KBNWnXrZ1oua8r-2XqC_2g,"Wake Forest, NC",12/22/2019,4.0,"3.75 stars, rounded up. The ambience and staff at this restaurant are great. The menu seems unique. I was not wowed, and I generally am somehow with something at a restaurant of this caliber in NYC when I visit. The arugula salad was good. The crab toast was great. I ordered the tagliatelle with shaved black truffles and fresh mozzarella. I even asked our server what she thought and she said this was a favorite. I was really excited, as I generally am for delicious pasta. This dish was actually beyond boring. Which is hard to do with black truffles, right?  The flavor profile was bland. Nothing stood out, including the truffle taste. The sauce was just ok, nothing extra to add pizazz. Could maybe use some red chili flakes or something to kick it up. Sun dried tomatoes or spinach or mushrooms or SOMETHING. Anything for a $34 pasta that I would pass up for the mushroom ravioli at Olive Garden (yes I went there, to the Walmart of Italian restaurants). The sea bass was also just ok as was the ravioli (very plain dish). Not sure that I would return but the company was good and we had a good time.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The calamari was coated in pretzel crumbs which was very mild tasting but delicious. The crab toast was delicious and unique. Full of flavor and different that the norm of what you ""normally"" get on a menu, it was very light and flavorful. My pasta with bolognese was very good and spicy. So if you don't like spicy then stay clear. The porkchop on the menu was heavenly it was so juicy and tender and the apples added the perfect combo. It was spectacular. Got the shaved brussel spout slaw and it was bland, wouldn't get that again. Our server was super nice, but our service was slow at the same time. Needed to ask for a refill and to have my bread plate cleared after removing everything else.

We ordered the meat and cheese platter to start and the prosciutto smelled a bit weird and had excess fat on it. When I told one of the employees, they told me that's the way it comes. I come from a meat and cheese background and that's not how it's supposed to be. I asked for crackers but they said the best they had was toasted bread, but even that came out extremely burnt. Our drinks were watered way down. My friends ravioli had one peice of burned or over cooked ravioli. And the burger I ordered medium well was medium at best. Fries were coldish and droopy. Within 35 minutes we paid the check and left. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

However, I think that it would be better paired with a creamier ice cream/sorbet.  The almond and pear garnish enhanced, but the pear sorbet didn't really compliment the cake - it was a little too icy and overpowering.  Perhaps a lighter pear ice cream (or even vanilla or milk flavored) would bring the dish to five stars in my mind.  Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The service was terrible, and the food was just decent. I had emailed them to ask if they had a specific Thanksgiving menu and never heard back, and didn't see a special Thanksgiving menu on their website or social media (or any mention of a holiday prix fixe), or anywhere on Resy where I made the reservation, so I assumed they were just offering their normal menu. I was shocked when we sat down and it was $168/person for a 3 course prix fixe menu that was items they normally offer for twice the price of what the same items normally cost. A table next to us told us not to order the Turkey as they were leaving because it wasn't good, and the two other tables next to us had to send their food back and also complained about the service.

We made a reservation and got seated right away. The food came out pretty quickly one by one. Since we were sharing it felt like a course meal. Every one of them were so good. They also use organic or locally produced ingredients. Don't forget to get the sundae for dessert even though you are full! It is the right amount of sweetness.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My rose glass was never empty, as our waiter was always close by, keeping an eye on our glasses. The table was constantly being cleared by the rest of the staff, to make room for the new food being brought in. And the food itself was fantastic. We had the crab toast with lemon aoli, perfect to share between two people and very tasty, packed with a lot of crab on top as well. We also had the calamari, the roast carrot and avocado salad, and the line caught tuna sashimi. Everything we ate was flavorful, beautifully presented, and came out relatively quickly as well. The restaurant itself is very pretty, big, and spacious, but the acoustics are so well done that you can hear the person you are talking to without having to yell.

The service was good in the beginning, until the part where the food was supposed to come, but just didn't... and the restaurant was only half filled by the time we were eating ~10pm. We sat for almost 30 minutes between the appetizer course and entree, which was just the raviolis... I didn't expect it to take over 30 minutes between collecting our appetizer plates to receiving it, to cook raviolis.... And they were a bit anti-climatic. For the price, hype, and difficulty getting a reservation, I won't be returning.

Would recommend making a reservation ahead of time and showing up on time as they are quite strict with their rsvp policy. The carrot/avocado salad was simple yet delicious and worth the hype. Also the mushroom pizza was a great size for us to split. It's the kind of dinner place that makes you want to go a second time to try completely different things because the whole menu looks amazing. Cocktails were unique and expensive - didn't love mine.

We ordered butternut squash soup, seared salmon, portobello mushroom sandwich ( more like a burger) , lemon tart and chocolate cake. ALL THE FOOD IS PHENOMENAL. The cake was crunchy and delectable with a marshmallow burnt crust. The lemon tart was sweet with some tarty berries and some fresh cream. The butternut squash soup was tasty thick and creamy. The entrees were medium rare seared salmon with a fresh velvety salad and light dresssing that added a kick. The portobello mushroom also has a similar sauce but it tasted a lot like mushrooms. Fresh bun too. The decor of the restaurant is barn esque. All the staff wore plaid.

Ordered the cauliflower soup which was brought cold. Sent it back to get warmed. Ordered the salmon red cabbage and apple mustard. Couldn't get through the sweet flavor of the red cabbage and the overwhelming mustard sauce. The salmon was dry and it was not fun to eat just because it wasn't hot enough. I called restaurant to give feedback to manager, they took my number and email but never received any communication back. The food left a lot to be desired and just not the best dining experience for lunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It was hardly noticeable from the street though, since the sign was small and white with thin lettering. The place was actually very spacious inside with several dining areas. I loved the decor, with rustic and earthy accents. I also liked that all the servers wore plaid button-down's. As far as service was concerned, we had multiple servers come tend to our table, and everyone was cordial. The food was great overall. We ordered the Crab Toast with Lemon Aioli and Wood Oven Roasted Maine Lobster with Oregano and Lemon-Chili Vinaigrette. Both were delicious. The ingredients tasted fresh and everything complemented each other nicely. We were wishing the portions were bigger! My friend got a glass of Grapefruit Juice, which was also really good.

I ordered the market fresh radishes with seasoned butter which were good, the butters were pretty tasty. I then ordered the roast carrot and avocado salad. This was amazing and had a creamy taste with a tang to it! Following that I had the winter squash campanelle, which was good if a little overly sweet from the squash.

You can not go wrong with anything you order from the menu. Everything is delicious! I highly recommend the mushroom pizza with egg on top. It's awesome. Its small and you could eat it all on your own or you can be nice and share with your company. For dessert you must order the ice cream sundae.

My personal favorite was the Prix-fixe lunch menu: Seared salmon, bibb salad, market vegetables, spicy buttermilk-herb vinaigrette.

So what next? Cookie Plate and coffee.  That homemade Mallomar made the whole lunch... add the peanut butter and jelly cookie, the fig topped sugar cookie and the chocolate chip... so, after five glasses of water, two hours of laughing and the sweetest waitress that was attentive and yet allowed us to chat, we decided to call it a day.  A rather pricey lunch, but worth it for every bite.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

After being seated, we waited about half an hour for the waitress to even notice us. They didn't even give us a menu or even take our drinks which was really strange and made our lunch a lot longer than it needed to be. Once we finally got the attention of a waitress, things were great but it was extremely irritating being ignored. In terms of food, I really enjoyed everything I ate and loved the ginger margarita.

Honestly I'd give this a 4.5 (Yelp should give us that option), & the only thing keeping it from a 5 is the price. The food and service was fantastic. The ambiance was nice, one of the nicest interiors of a restuarant I've ever seen. We got a mixed drink I can't remember the name, it came in a pretty small glass & costs 18$!! For three ppl the bill after a roughly 20% tip came to be over $160, that's pretty expensive. But I can't deny the salmon was delicious, I had the pork confit which I loved (it was pretty small though), and my parents loved the calamari so we had a good time. So 4 stars cuz we were there for just a little less than an hour & unless you've got plenty of dough to spend, Id just eat somewhere less pricier or try out this place once if you'd like.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Secil A.,/user_details?userid=h9Odn2y78bGz1m3kM-ETvQ,"Manhattan, NY",11/27/2018,5.0,Always a pleasant experience! I always get their roasted carrot and avocado salad to start with when I go there. The dressing can be a little salty (so I try to not forget to order it on the side) but both the carrot and avocados in the salad taste great with the dressing. I know their pizzas are very famous (and I've tried it it's delicious) but I really like their black sea bass. My friend had the ricotta ravioli that she really liked as well. The service was quick and the complimentary bread they bring is also very delicious.

Priscilla C.,/user_details?userid=ugk-HlSSEXixiUNagI0Idw,"Davis, CA",9/12/2016,5.0,"I've walked around ABC home and carpet quite a few times and every time I get to the back of the main floor, I always see this ""small"" cafe looking place where people are eating. Well little did I know, this ""small"" little appearing cafe is a huge restaurant down below. All I was seeing was just a small section. The restaurant decor is gorgeous. This restaurant is owned by the famous Jean Georges who also owns the 3 Michelin star French restaurant at 1 Central Park West (Trump International Hotel & Tower). He also owns the sister restaurant attached to ABC kitchen next door named ABC Cocina where they serve more of Latin based tapas. This man is doing it all! We ordered a prefixed ($34) with the raw tuna as starter, ravioli for entree and the salted caramel sundae for dessert. The raw tuna was very fresh and the sauce so good! The ravioli had ricotta cheese and a runny egg inside. When you cut it open, the yolk spills over the pulled pork under. I don't know what the heck they put into this dish, but the flavors were amazing. Everything went so beautifully well together. I personally had the lobster. I originally wanted the black Sea bass which I heard is super popular and wonderful, but they didn't have it today and was going to substitute with branzino fish instead which I didn't like so I went with the lobster. The lobster was roasted with some spices. The level of spice was perfect, just mild. It was simple, but somehow they still made it taste so good. Usually roasted seafoods are dry, but this restaurant was able to maintain its juiciness and texture, a plus! The crab toast appetizer was delicious. The bread was hard, but even the bread had flavor. I think they soaked it in olive oil. They use real crab meat and smear it all over the toast with a good amount of crab meat. You get 2 loaves, cut into 4 pieces. Last, but not least, the salted caramel dessert had 2 scoops of salted caramel ice cream with caramel popcorn on the sides and some fudge and peanuts. It kind of tastes like a snickers ice cream bar in some ways. It was pretty good. We also ordered a side of corn which was pretty good too. They cut the corn fresh from a cob, use their own homemade butter and threw some scallions and secret ingredients in it. This restaurant is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for which is Jean Georges deliciousness! Now, I want to try every one of his restaurants! Supposedly, he has restaurants all around Manhattan and is simply amazing. We randomly came in as walk ins for lunch and was lucky enough to have a high bar seating table. Make reservations. The place filled up so quickly.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Efraim S.,/user_details?userid=BZ4pFzaV5DG9vVBq2PXWBg,"Philadelphia, PA",7/29/2016,4.0,"Came here for restaurant week lunch with the girlfriend. We have been doing restaurant week for four years now and this was one of the better experiences. We loved the decor and the organized quirkiness of the space. The service was attentive and professional. In the past I have hate Jean Jorge restaurants (been to 4) as I find the portions too small, prices too high, and food unremarkable. I didn't feel that way at all about abc. The food was actually quite tasty and I left full. I was not amazed by any dish but I thought each dish had a nice flavor profile and was well cooked. The least satisfying course was the appetizers. The kale salad was rather underwhelming and the fluke though flavorful seemed below quality (stringy and tough). Crude should melt in your mouth. But the fish improved with the Salmon in a terrific carrot sauce and the portobello burger was full of flavor. My favorite course as usual was desert. The peaches were cooked beautifully and full of flavor.  The pistachio ice cream actually tasted like pistachios and complimented the peaches terrifically. I thought that the chocolate cake was very passable though I didn't get many bites as my gf gobbled it all up. In sum it was a pleasant experience.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Keeley G.,/user_details?userid=SVTH55FF5eXW4n_TBF39Ow,"New York, NY",5/24/2018,3.0,"Went here on a Tuesday night around 7, it was pretty packed. We put our name down for 2 and were told it was about a 20 min wait. We waited outside but after 20 mins decided to go in and wait at the bar. A young man took a drink order but almost 15 mins later we still had no drink. He was clearly a barback and couldn't serve but was going to pass the order along to one of the bartenders. When we saw him again and asked how the drinks were coming he didn't even recognize us. Understandable as it was packed but now we've got no drinks and no table 35 mins later. They resurrected the situation by grabbing a bartender who quickly made our drinks then graciously offered to comp them. We decided to order food at the bar, and as our first dish came the host told us our table was ready, 50 mins later. We just decided to stay at the bar. The drinks were good, as was the food but I wouldn't say spectacular. The ambiance is enjoyable and the bartender who ended up serving us was nice but I would say overall this was average and not worth the hype. Also having worked as a host, it really pays off to know your dining room and your patrons to better estimate wait time and keep everyone happy.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My finance and I came here for Christmas dinner while vacationing in the big Apple. The best part of ABC Kitchen is the decor inside. You would think you're transported to a winter wonderland. Very beautiful space, so I may come back for dessert or drinks. During the night we had 2 waitresses. The first waitress had terrible attitude while our second waitress was very sweet. The food was just OK. We started off with the kale salad which my fiancé liked but I couldn't finish. Which is odd considering I love kale. The chili's were too spicy for me and I wasn't a huge fan of how much lemon was in it. For our entrees, hubby ordered the burger while I opted for the half portion of pesto fettuccine. The pasta was good, very warm and rich sauce. Probably my favorite of the night but again nothing that was WOW. Same goes for hubby's burger, which according to our waitress is Top 5 in Manhattan.

The fried chicken was raved about by friends and I thought it was just ok. The service kinda sucked though. It took so long for our fried chicken to come out, I almost cancelled it but i really wanted to try it. I had to tell 2 different waiters to ask where it was because it literally was 40 minutes after the dish before it when it came out. They ended up comping the chicken off the bill so that semi made up for the slow service. Place is cool though and a nice atmosphere.

Peggy C.,/user_details?userid=eRCQMWE2tNuN7hXKUUfymA,"Los Angeles, CA",2/13/2018,3.0,"A friend and I came here recently for dinner. We had both been here before multiple times and loved it. Even without reservations, we were able to grab a seat at the bar after only having to wait a short while which was lucky. Service was very friendly and attentive. Our food, however, was only so-so this time and that was really disappointing. I got the squash toast and the mushroom pizza while my friend got the calamari appetizer as well as a fish entrée. While I love the squash toast I do think at this point it is a tad overpriced for what it is (and I have personally made it before so I know how much work goes into it). It took a very long time for our entrées to come out and when they finally did my pizza mushroom had clearly been sitting out for a little while-it was a bit cold and the egg on top had been cooked too long and the yolk was no longer runny. My friend's calamari was pretty chewy and her fish dish was very unmemorable. Honestly, if we had been rating ABC Kitchen based on previous visits they would have received four stars easily at the very least, but unfortunately this trip didn't measure up. I still have fond memories of this place, and I do appreciate that we were able to still have dinner here without a reservation.

Went here about a year ago to celebrate a friend's birthday and shocked I never wrote a review! The inside of the restaurant is absolute beautiful and natural. Their food is organic and they have a vegetable garden on the rooftop of their building and there's nothing I appreciate more than food that is treated properly. While there, our waiter was very attentive and professional and so was the rest of the staff that we came into contact with. There was the traditional complimentary bread served with a side of olive oil and I added some sea salt to it which I recommend doing. For an appetizer we got the calamari which came dressed like a pretzel and came with marina sauce and musters aioli. The mustard aioli really brought the pretzel idea to life. For my main course, I had the kasha and bow tie pasta which came with veal meatballs. Honestly it's been a year since I've eaten it but I still think about it all the time! Amazing, the sauce was a brown sauce which was sweet and came with this little round nuts that gave the pasta an nice crunch and the veal meatballs melted in my mouth. I highly recommend getting this pasta. Very wonderful. For dessert I had ice cream and sorbet and when getting this you get to choose three flavors. Great restaurant!

Decor, service, and taste are a high 4 out of 5. My friends and I each got an entree and shared a pizza that had brussels sprouts...which didn't taste like cardboard surprisingly! I also really enjoyed the crab toast lemon aioli, but thumbs down for small portions as a consequence of chic eating. Liked my entree even more, which was black bass with chilies, herbs, spinach and basil. Normally I wouldn't order fish just because I don't think it's worth the price and flavor. Yet this black bass had just the right amount of sweet and sour. Top it off with some baby market potatoes and I indulged myself in a good ol' American dinner.

Ali H.,/user_details?userid=_vZXnBT9HqNHu_mKWQltAQ,"Brooklyn, NY",4/11/2018,5.0,"First time going to this restaurant and was not disappointed. Something to note is portions are quite small. We started with the ramp and goat cheese toast which was amazing. So happy I got to experience this toast while ramps are in season (something crazy like 3 weeks I think?!) Next we had the kale and Serrano salad with lime. Dayum that Serrano is spicy! Luckily I was avidly to pick them out and give to my husband lol! The salad was great with the tiniest cutest croutons you have ever seen. Next we had the tuna sashimi which was melt in your mouth fresh. I rarely eat raw fish but I saw this dish and knew it was high quality tuna and worth trying. So happy I did! The marinade/sauce it came in was tangy and citrusy. Seriously delicious. The waiter suggested dipping the crusty bread they give for the table into the marinade and OMGGGGG. Next we had the fettuccini with fresh peas and pesto. Seriously refined and delicious. The perfect amount of pasta. Now, as you can imagine by this point I was stuffed. But we had ordered the mushroom pizza and that was up next.  To me, this was the weakest dish of the night compared to the awesomeness of the rest. My husband, on the other hand loved it and gobbled it up with no problem. For dessert (treat yo self) we shared the chocolate Creme brûlée. I do prefer the classic vanilla bean but this was nice.

For our main course I had the special Black Sea bass with potatoes and spinach. I found this dish flat- with no seasoning except for a drop of chili oil on the fish. The fish was prepared very nicely with a nice crisp sear on it but the potatoes and spinach seemed just boiled and lacked even salt. The wait staff was great and attentive- no issues.

I won't get into it because its something worth seeing for yourself... We started with some wine and the pretzel crusted calamari-- incredible. They bring out bread too, which was awesome. I split the spinach and goat cheese za and the half size of the jalapeño and ricotta angel hair pasta. The other girls I was with split the other 2 pastas. The raviolis were DIVINE. For dessert we got the sundae that came with the cracker jacks. we weren't too hungry, but we couldn't skip the most important part of the meal.

Seems ABC, like many of Jean Georges older restaurants, is stepping back from what made it great, casual but attentive service and meticulous attention to the food. On a recent visit both missed the mark. A favorite, crab toast, was peppered with crab shell, a lazy oversight, but one that made it inedible. Service was clumsy, after asking repeatedly for lemon, none ever came, and a bottle of wine ordered far before the mains, arrived well after our entire table had finished.

The angel hair with saffron, golden garlic, jalapeños, herbs and fresh ricotta was so simple but had really nuanced flavors and a subtle kick from the peppers - incredible. I actually changed my mind and ordered this after hearing our waitress's description, and the entree size ($25) was a solid, filling portion. It comes in olive oil and our waitress suggested mixing it all together with the ricotta so create its own kind of sauce. My friend ordered the scrambled eggs with crispy oysters and hot sauce butter, which we were told they sell out of every brunch time. Again, perfectly soft-scrambled eggs with deceptively deep flavors. We started with the seasonal glazed donuts to share (one chocolate, one berry), which I would definitely skip next time as they were somewhat lackluster, especially at $10 for two. The glaze was good but the donuts themselves were small and slightly dry.

My issue may have been specific to my situation, but the dishes I had (while good and interesting) felt like missed opportunities to give me something amazing-which makes me cranky in retrospect. Three stars because the mushroom bolognese came out looking like a portioned bag of dry microwaved pasta (with a GREAT sauce poured on top.) The hot sauce butter served with both the mushroom app and my entree of fried chicken was DELICIOUS... but why not serve the mushrooms along with the chicken instead of having both? Or put that fried chicken with a little more starch? The apple pie came out barely warm. Mainly, everything was good, but for the price I feel like more care could have been given to each dish- more so the process of cooking than the actual menu.

Walked in with a friend so we had an hour wait but had a tasty drink while we did - the Manhattan is perfect. For an appetizer I tried the tuna sashimi and it's the best I've had in NYC because of the ginger soy sauce. My only complaint was that it was a little too small a portion. The hake entree was excellent. It came with crispy potatoes and a sauce I'm still dreaming about. the sundae for dessert was amazing, although I could have done without the popcorn on top. We sat in the back room where the restaurant meets ABC Cocina and it was a great ambiance - had privacy but felt communal. I think we had chatted with half the dining room by the time our dinner was over.

My dish was some kind of pasta I believe and it was just so salty and not enjoyable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Luckily for us we love to share, the chefs did an outstanding job splitting everything up before they even came out. Just to make things slightly complicated we asked the bar tender to get creative with a whiskey drinks, a perfectly done whiskey sour infused with a hint of orange and bitters swept us off our feet. The menu was quite detailed and provided a variety of options. We shared two appetizer/starters. The tuna ginger deluxe sashimi was absolutely mouth watering greatness. A taste I will never forget! Followed by the carrot avocado salad (a suggestion by the waiter) it was also very delightful! By this point we were already enthusiasts but we still had a few courses left. We ordered the buttery fried chicken with greens and it was probably the best chicken dish I have ever ordered. It was buttery, Spicy and cooked to perfection. Our dessert followed in perfect timing, this is the part I am always most excited about! The strawberry rhubarb pie was yummy but with the only let down of the night hardly had any ""filling"" with rhubarb and strawberry to it. It was mostly crust. Beyond that the interior and environment is quite lovely and the wait staff were prompt, adorable, helpful and very nice! We enjoyed every minute of our experience.

Bob G.,/user_details?userid=xFxkiR6mHrE27RO9jd-GJQ,"JAMAICA, NY",7/15/2017,4.0,"My third time dining at ABC Kitchen. Maybe it was the time of year but the experience fell short of the previous two meals. We had a 7:30 Opentable reservation but arrived at 7:15 and were seated in the ""transition"" room where the entrance to the store is and the entrance from the store to ABC Cocina is. Advantages is much less noise, views of the dessert kitchen, and brighter atmosphere. Disadvantages is the area is warmer than the rest of the restaurant.  Our servers were efficient but not particularly personable. Yet, they got the job done and nothing ever went wrong. We began with the Endive and Sugar Snap Pea Salad with parmesan dressing and herbs. There was nothing wrong with it, but there was nothing exceptional about it either and it seemed excessively sweet. Our other appetizer was the Tomato and watermelon gazpacho. I was a little disappointed in this dish since it has a strong tomato flavor with too much tomato skin IMO, and little if any watermelon flavor and was excessively sweet. One of our entrees was the Roasted Hake with Cherry Tomatoes and Basil. For $34.00, the portion was ridiculously small. The sauce was excellent but the fish itself was ordinary. My dining partner had the Black sea bass with chilies and herbs, baby market potatoes and spinach. It was good, but once again sweet. Dessert was Strawberry Rhubarb tart with buttermilk ginger ice cream. This dessert was amazing and by far, the best thing we had. Coffee; regular and decaf were excellent but refills weren't offered. Not a big deal since the mugs they served the coffee in were large and the cost, $4.00, reasonable these days. The servers seemed to work as a ""team"" but somehow missed teamwork. Overall, an excellent experience but not quite up to our previous two visits. Still deserving on 4 stars though.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The aesthetic was beautiful and the dim lights gave off the perfect, intimate vibe. We sat at the bar for a drink and were very impressed by how incredibly friendly the man at the bar was. He let us taste two different wines and gave us a very thorough description of each. He was incredibly kind and genuinely wanted to know about what we were doing for the holidays. When we got moved to our table, our waiter was incredibly helpful in recommending us dishes and once we ordered, our food came out relatively quickly. The food was incredible and just the perfect portion for the two of us. We had the clamari, sea bass, and the pork; for dessert we had the sundae, which was out of this world!

Katie W.,/user_details?userid=4G0TWt2iK0E56s80LOnl2Q,"Chicago, IL",3/11/2019,3.0,"I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time and it was mostly great but a couple things made it feel like a rip off. Almost immediately after we ordered, two of our dishes came out and then a couple minutes later the third one arrived, so half of our items came out in the span of like 10 minutes. At first we were impressed but that quickly turned to annoyance that they were just trying to turn the table as fast as possible. There's really no need to be deluged with food from the get go, especially at these prices. Which brings me to my second point...it is expensive *for what it is*. The ambiance is amazing and the food is very good, but it is not unique. Many, many restaurants serve exactly this genre of food and do it just as well but at a more reasonable price. The kale salad is $18 and we literally laughed at the portion size. It was a light dusting of kale (we could see the plate through the salad) and it had maybe 4-5 small croutons and a couple peppers. It was good but should have been $10. Same with pretty much everything we tried - delicious but overpriced. This struck me as the type of place that's ideal for a group because it has a great vibe and there's something for everyone, but I didn't leave feeling like I had to come back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Marla L.,/user_details?userid=yy3P33ZgH-f2Zx8L6BIGsA,"Westlake Village, CA",5/20/2016,5.0,Hosted a private party last night for my sons graduation. Service was really great. The food on the other hand was off the charts fabulous! Each dish was prepared perfectly.  Lobsters were so good!  The drinks were interesting mixes with fresh herbs that had everyone sipping and sharing. I had a few foodies in the group and they were so impressed. Made the booking from out of town and was put at ease from the start. Thank you for a perfect evening!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The bartender was not attentive, if there are too many drink orders from people seated at tables you probably need a dedicated person to do that.

Forgot to mention very spicy margarita which put Nomad's hot lips to shame. Very quality meat I could tell cheese ok. Then we had ravioli to share good portion great texture melt in your mouth.

Not sure if there was some glitch in the kitchen that caused it to be without the Hollandaise, but noticed early in the meal that the eggs were overcooked and chose to let it go (theoretically making it even more apparent that the sauce was missing).

Liz S.,/user_details?userid=EzHVkq_aplBXpLre5lqJ8g,"Seattle, WA",6/13/2016,4.0,"Really great service and good food. I got the rhubarb negroni which was pretty tasty. It wasn't too different from the standard negroni, really. Based on other reviews, I had to try the crab toast with lemon aioli. It was good but didn't quite live up to all the hype. The roast carrot and avocado salad with crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus was amazing though. Definitely the best dish I tried. The carrots were so flavorful! And avocado makes everything better. For the entree I split the whole wheat mushroom pizza with Parmesan, oregano and a farm egg. The flavor was good, and you can't even really tell that the crust is whole wheat. They definitely aren't stingy with the mushrooms either. However, the egg white was not even close to being set! The egg white jiggled all over the place. So clearly I scraped that part off the pizza. I also tried the seasonal fettuccine with spring peas, ramps and basil-pistachio pesto. This dish was bright, light and full of spring flavors, but still satisfying. The ricotta ravioli served in a tomato sauce looked good too, although I didn't get a chance to sample that dish. For dessert we ordered the doughnuts. We got a simple peach jam stuffed doughnut (the best), a simple chocolate glazed doughnut and a blackberry glazed doughnut, I believe. They were all good. The trendy interior was fun, but a little dark. If your eyesight isn't as good as it used to be (I haven't got to that point yet) you might have to squint at the menu a bit.

The first time, the personal connection and personal attention from the waitress was above and beyond. The food was good, without question, the best in the world? Probably not, but I'd never be embarrassed to take a client here for dinner or lunch. They focus on clean sustainably sourced food. That to me is key. The first think i look for in choosing any food location is sustainably sourced, organic, free range, grass fed, pasture raised and all that clean goodness. The vibe here is cool, not to upscale you feel totally stupid in shorts and a T, and you could never feel overdressed.

The food was okay, I think you're definitely paying for the vibes of the restaurant and the food seems to be farm to table which ups the price but overall very good. We ordered the cheese and charcuterie board and the tuna sashimi to start. The cheese board was fine, very average definitely not worth $22 but the tuna sashimi was amazing the sauce and mint were amazing but it was extremely small portion wise and very light. I had the ricotta ravioli which was good it was in a sweet red sauce. My friend had the salmon which she was surprised to find out it was on a bed of mashed potatoes which she hates but if you like it then yay!

The food is very good--I love the use of fresh vegetables and the seafood is excellent quality. To start, I had the butternut squash soup with toasted pepitos and creme fraiche (delicious on a blustery February day), and my husband had the shaved raw fluke which was dressed in a lemony sauce and melted in my mouth. For the entree, we both got the seared salmon, which we asked to have cooked rare--which they did, perfectly. The salad it was on top of was pretty basic (bib lettuce, radishes) with a spicy dressing; TBH, I could've done without it. It didn't add much to the dish, in fact I felt the dressing overpowered the subtle, buttery quality of the fish. The dessert portions were extremely generous. I got the chocolate cake, which had a toasted marshmallow frosting on it, and my husband got the lemon tart. I thought the tart was better, but both were delicious.

A delicious combination of dry rubbed roasted acorn squash with garlic roasted maitake mushrooms on a pool of a goat cheese dressing. SO GOOD!! The squash was seasoned with chili, star anise, and maple syrup...so fresh. Next was the pear and apple salad. Another amazing dish...the apples were caramelized and super sweet. Loved the pecan vinaigrette. The cavatelli with broccoli rabe and sausage was so delicious. Shared that with my sister and my brother in law and they shared the black sea bass and goat cheese and spinach pizza. Everything was so delicious and inventive. The popcorn sundae was the perfect ending. ABSOLUTELY will go back again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The egg was perfectly cooked where the yolk was still a little runny. Soaked it all up with the pizza crust. YUM. Service was okay.

It's true, you have to make sure you order the right food or else the portion of the food will be EXTREMELY small. For me, thank goodness I order ribs that was enough portion and worth its price. But for my friend, How can 5 pieces of small steak end up costing double my meal.  That enough to make you full? U got to be kidding me. She look at me and said sorry for bringing me here but i should be saying sorry to her because she ate basically nothing. What is worse is that it was my friends birthday and all we wanted was for them to serve the cake after we finished the food, but it's an additional $5 per person since they are ""serving"" you and using their materials. Just no. We end up taking back the cake which is so embarrassing because we wanted to surprise our friend but all they wanted was to take our money for unnecessary reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The omelet so thick, and we both are pretty sure we got sick off the goat cheese. We both ended up visiting the washroom very soon after leaving.

Started with the Roasted Beets which were tangy, decadent, and delicious. Moved onto the Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad yet again (it was so great the first time I ordered it that I couldn't help but get it again), and the Scrambled Eggs with Crispy Potatoes for my entree. The eggs were perfectly cooked; creamy and delicious, simply prepared. The potatoes were super crispy (just how I like them), and made for a delicious morning meal. My dining partner ended with the infamous Salted Caramel Sundae and happily devoured the entire thing. Once again, the service was friendly and efficient, the food came out in perfect time and was nice and hot, and the atmosphere completes the whole experience. I can't get enough of this place!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jaclyn O.,/user_details?userid=UEoO-jvTxPakmmQLbsOuhg,"Houston, TX",11/10/2015,4.0,"This night did not start off well, but it did end well. First off, we were 15-20 minutes late for our reservation. The hostess asked if the kitchen was closed, and they decided to let us in, but our first (male) server was very surly about it. I appreciated that they were going to stay open for us (and was planning on tipping accordingly), but that's no excuse for a bad attitude. Maybe it was because it was the end of his shift, but we were given a second server and she was very nice. So the night started to turn around. We ate some delicious appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I have to say that the appetizers and desserts stole the show. The entrees were solid, but ABC Kitchen really shines in the first and third courses. As many people have mentioned, the crab toast is simply amazing and worth your cheat meal. As far as desserts, I think we tried at least four of them and they were all excellent, so you can't go wrong with any of your choices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Out of the entire menu though roasted carrots & avocado salad was the best thing in this restaurant.  Who would have known. Drinks, order what you know stay away from specials or exotic stuff they recommend, definitely a waste. Now on cons: ambiance is kind of off, fancy meets ikea sort of feeling. Art on the walls, light fixtures and cheap looking plain rustic looking tables/chairs.

The decor is minimal and subtle - you feel warm and comfortable without really thinking too much about it until you notice very small but thoughtful details. Service is very welcoming, kind, and helpful. Our waitress recommended several dishes that we loved. The crab toast is delicious, as is the fettuccine, but the star of the meal is definitely the mushroom pizza, which is complex and earthy without being too rich or overpowering. For dessert we split the brown butter carrot cake (amazing) and the salted caramel ice cream and the maple pecan ice cream, all of which is worth feeling a little full when you leave.

Market appetizers are very tasty. The Striped Bass ( I know I know finger wags for eating bass - in my defense it was a few years ago) is flaky slightly spicy and acidic. I've heard that since Kluger's departure things have dipped a bit - on the plus side maybe now it will be possible to get a table impromptu. It's a great date spot as the scenery has a certain dreaminess to it. The service is attentive while being casual. If they stole a page from Perla's book and found a realistic way to reduce the prices this place would be an undeniable gem - but either way it's a nice place to try so long as you curb your expectations. If you can get a rare same day seat - go for it but certainly do not book far in advance for a mind altering experience because that's not what this is.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The taste was evenly balanced between parmesan, mushrooms, red pepper, and egg. I also had the roast carrot and avocado salad which was fresh and hearty by far leaps ahead of your normal salad.

Sakshi G.,/user_details?userid=tOif_ZtCKxPEVwgZIAt2Xg,"Melbourne, FL",3/25/2015,4.0,"So we went here for the weekday lunch here coz me and my husband got lucky to get a nice Friday afternoon off. Anyway, it was a terrible snow day and I was sure that place is gonna be empty. I mean who is gonna go to lunch on Friday in such terrible snow storm. But New york never fails to surprise!!! The place was packed. No wonder their reservations are always full. Anyway, our attraction was definitely the $32 pre fixe 3 course lunch. An appetizer, entree and a dessert for $32. Pretty sweet deal. So i got kale salad for the appetizer. Good, a little tart. For entree, I had portobello burger. Personally I am not a fan of mushrooms but I am a vegetarian and that was the only vegetarian option on the pre fixe menu, so had to get it. I found it pretty bland though the bread was pretty nice. For dessert I got the orange tart. Too dense. Couldn't have the whole thing. My husband got raw fluke for appetizer. He loved it. For entree I think he got the pork. He said it was ok and trust me he loves pork. But the star of the afternoon was definitely his dessert!!! Salted caramel sundae with caramel popcorn!!! Amazing!!!!! I don't even like salted caramel, but that sundae was crazy!!! Drinks were great too!!! So i would say, even if u can't get a reservation for dinner, just go for drinks and salted caramel sundae and I promise you, You won't regret it!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Addison D.,/user_details?userid=2qjCrhJVpFfQOxcrFePERg,"Manhattan, NY",10/30/2016,1.0,"The ABC Kitchen reservation people tell you robotically that they have a ""31-day wait"" as though this is something of which to be proud. That should be the tip-off: your experience will be impersonal, a business transaction and, as with a casino, the house will always win. In fact, we got a reservation a week in advance -- we were told we'd have to be placed at a high-top cocktail table to accommodate the addition of a third person to our party -- but in actuality when we arrived, we were seated at a table for four in a restaurant that was no more than 25 percent full. They're trying to simulate white-hot demand well after it has diminished. Our server was hard-edged, curt, in no way welcoming or helpful. She and her colleagues' repeated response to our requests was: ""Not a problem."" This phrase, a Millennial idiom, was dropped on us six or seven times during our dinner. One wanted to ask: ""And if it is a problem to bring us more bread, wouldn't  it be best for you to leave the hospitality industry -- and close this poor excuse for a restaurant while you're at it?"" Lighting is uncomfortable -- pin spots that leave much of the place in gloom; several diners around us had to use flashlights to read the menus. Noise level was extremely high despite the place being only two-thirds full by the time we left. (When full, the noise level must be violently, injuriously high).  The din is boosted by ""music"" that cannot be discerned clearly but which causes everyone to shout to be heard; conversations are strained and patrons and servers highly stressed. The food -- a kale salad and a carrot salad, a fish entree, a pasta entree, a side order -- was above average in quality, but in no way memorable, and portion size was very small in proportion to price. The desserts -- almond cake and chocolate cake -- were notably poor -- dry and bland. The wine list is interesting but, as with the food, priced 30%+ above an already high NYC restaurant mark-up.  A fresh fruit juice was perhaps four ounces for $14 -- insulting. We left hungry and dissatisfied, feeling ripped off and angry. We're New Yorkers, and we've traveled extensively in Europe, South America, and across the US, and know quality and creativity, service and hospitality, and what constitutes fair pricing for first-class cuisine. ABC Kitchen fails in all key areas. Jean-Georges Vongerichten should try to spend less time with his private equity investors and more time in the kitchen; if this place was ever any good, it now needs to be entirely reformed. But my guess is that JGV is too busy planning for his next quarter's shareholders' meeting. Why mess with a successful investment if the Yahoos (and Yelpers) keep lining up to shell out?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I almost feel like they monitor the online traffic and just to over hype and increase the want of this place they dont show reservations online. For most of the time that we were there between 6-8:30 pm there were quiet a few tables and bar stools empty. We started with the mushroom pizza with the egg on top and the egg was a little runny and the pizza was overloaded with mushrooms. A little less mushroom with charred onion etc must have felt better. We also had the pasta with meatballs..the meatballs did not overly entice me. I have had better tasting meatballs from costco and the pasta knots got harder in the middle as if they were undercooked as the food got a little cold. Kale-avocado salad was Meeeh!. We ordered the fish and I would say..dont order it. 32$ could be well spent on two apps rather than the fish. For dessert we had the almond pound cake which again was a pound cake with a side of slit almonds and strawberries. surprisingly none of us at the table liked it. The sunday was a better option for the dessert. I wanted to try this place and I got to try it but I dont think so my experience with food was worth a second visit given the fact that you need to plan and reserve 3-4 weeks in advance.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The lighting makes it feel very intimate and cozy but the table still has enough light for everyone to see each other which is nice. We got the crab toast and tuna sashimi to start which were both excellent. We got salmon and angel hair pasta for mains - the pasta was just okay, it wasn't anything amazing but still nice. And for dessert, the creme brulee and salted caramel sundae, which were both also super delicious! I had also written on my reservation that it was our anniversary, and they brought out two cupcakes with candles and Happy Anniversary written on the plate! I was so grateful for this as we've been to restaurants for birthdays and such and they never remember or really care that it's a special occasion, but ABC kitchen did a great job of making us feel special, so thank you!

How does that even happen?? She did not empathize with our situation, did not care that it was my special day and said we could just leave.

I put our name in on a Saturday for brunch with a 90 minute wait, and they aren't lying, it's no less than the time they give. Once we sat down there was a large party next to us with two long tables of people celebrating something. We had the same three waiters that they did and it was blatantly clear they were super focused on the party table instead of us. We never knew who our waiter was, it took me getting up to ask for our check or I'm pretty sure we'd still be there. I can appreciate the work that goes into a large party of 30 or so, but for a restaurant like this to let it disturb service so much, especially after you wait for 90 minutes...I was surprised.

Less than enough to complement each bite unless I cut the apples up into tiny bits which made the dish feel a bit off balance.

Lily C.,/user_details?userid=cmwmpMU3j8XnGlhtaOf2ZA,"New York, NY",2/1/2017,3.0,This review is for their restaurant week lunch prix fix. My friends booked on a whim and were very pleasantly surprised by the overall atmosphere and service! The restaurant is very cozy and rustic and all of the waiter were friendly and helpful. The food was good but definitely underwhelming. The shaved fluke appetizer was overpowered by the huge mound of horseradish on top. I got the portobello sandwich as an entree which was tasty but very plain. I've had better portobello at sandwich places that were much cheaper than this place. I tried my friend's crispy shrimp and it was also very plain and bland. Dessert was definitely the highlight! The almond cake was moist and not overly sweet. Overall the food wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special,https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The combination of flavors with the tuna was outstanding.  Tuna was fresh as could be.  We also shared the crab toast and were in heaven with this choice.  We both had dreams about it for days.  Small pieces of sourdough toast with a crab salad on top.  Slight touch of hot without taking away from the flavor.  For our dinner we shared a mushroom pizza with a sunny side up egg in the middle.  The consistency of this gooey egg combined with the pizza was heaven in my mouth!  The pasta dish we shared was spinach fettucine with shaved brussel sprouts and a pistachio pesto.  Also amazing.  Although we were stuffed we just had to get a dessert as recommnended by our waiter.  We chose the caramel ice cream with popcorn.  Ice cream was heaven.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly and made great suggestions.  The restaurant is decorated so cute.  Very rustic and great mixed light fixtures with wooden beams on ceilings.  There was a really cool display of vegetables but not near me otherwise I would have taken a picture.  Will definitely be back again!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We got the ginger margarita and the thyme lemonade to drink, expensive but worth it and it's New York so it's kind of expected. I looked over the menu and everything looked delicious. I was leaning towards the turkey sandwich but hated to get just that at a place like that. But our waiter was quick to recommend it so I jumped and it was literally the best one I've ever had.

Vivian T.,/user_details?userid=PDDm6tSnrlZJ3YFaDcv-dw,"New York, NY",2/23/2016,5.0,"We participated in a pre-planned shared menu for a group event and the dinner here was absolutely amazing.  Appetizers included roasted beets with yogurt, crab toast, tuna sashimi marinated with ginger and mint but the roasted cauliflower with onion and walnut crumbs was the most obvious winner.  The nutty sweetness of the crunbs complimented the cauliflower perfectly.  Another winner was the mushroom pizza with parmesan and farm egg- the creamy cheese and egg was well paired with the earthy collection of mushrooms.  Being an ardent mushroom lover, I thoroughly enjoyed the glazed assorted mushrooms sauteed with chilies and herbs.  For my entree, I ordered crispy pork confit with the smoked bacon marmalade and braised turnips that was amazing.  This dish was probably a high end interpretation of the usual BBQ pulled pork.  The pork was succulent and tasty and the smoked bacon marmalade echoed the taste of home made bbq sauce. I liked the added savory braised turnips as an added farm-to-table contribution. Don't forget to save room for dessert!  We devoured the almond cake as well as the seasonal donuts.  The salted caramel ice cream came with something that was reminiscent of cracker jacks (minus the toy in the box!) - this dish although tasty was not as well attended to since people preferred the almond cake and donuts.  The service was attentive and the sommelier was available to help us pair our wines.  This was an amazing dinner and everything was delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Chloe L.,/user_details?userid=4Ff4jkboKDzTsiGRVv6Qzw,"Brooklyn, NY",8/11/2018,5.0,"Best crab toast I've ever had!! I'm a big seafood person so if you are into seafood, you would love it! It's quality crab meat and they are not stingy with the portion. The toast is thoroughly soaked with lemon aioli which balances out the fishy taste and adds so much flavor and freshness. I couldn't stop eating it! My bf had the egg benedict which was good as well, the ham and the crispy potatoes are all cooked to perfection although it looks very simple. Well sometimes it's hard to make simple dishes really memorable... We also had the roasted portobello which has a simple pure mushroom taste, some might think it needs more seasoning but I actually feel like it's nice to taste the simple flavors of good ingredients. What really makes me give 5  is really the superb service. Our server was friendly yet not overselling, he also brought us a cookie platter when the dessert we ordered was actually off the menu. We would love to come back again for dinner some time! The decor is cool, but just not to my personal taste although a lot of people love it.

This was delicious and the Kasha was a great addition to the dish. The dessert was the highlight of the meal, we ordered the popcorn sundae.

The interior is large, airy, and open filled with lots of natural light.  The decor has a farmhouse setting that is accented by white lacquered tables and chandeliers and black and white art pieces.  I started with the going and juice, a Gin based cocktail with goji berry juice which was a little tart but refreshing. It is not overpowering with the goji flavor though. The pancakes were perfectly cooked and were a thick cake-like style. What pulls it all together though is the Meyer lemon butter. It is out of this world. The eggs Benedict were exceptional too, the ham and eggs both being hand selected from local farms (as everything else with the menu).

Last night a friend and I went to ABC Kitchen because of their rave reviews over the years. Except for their pretty decor, this may have been the worst meal I have ever had in this city known for amazing food. My friend ordered a appetizer cucumber salad . It consisted of a quarter of a thinly sliced cucumber swimming in a liquid dressing  on a plate the size of a teacup holder.. I had a salad of thinly sliced squash , cheese and withered arugula also swimming in liquid,on a plate slightly larger. The main course was even worse. My friend had unrecognizable Sea Bass on a very small bed of spinach. It was smaller than an appetizer size and not very good. I had a piece of Salmon on top of a succotash combination swimming in vinegar. All of this carried an above average price tag and attitude! For dessert we shared a piece of their signature blueberry pie which was a step above a pop-tart in both size and taste. The server didn't bring bread to the table although the table next to us did receive it. New York is the Mecca for some of the best food in the country. This restaurant was not worth any of the hype!

Some of the most surprising things included the carrot and avacado salad. Not only did the carrots make a nice roasted subistitue for meat -- I haven't really tasted any sort of carrot preperation like that ever. It was worth every single bite. Soooo incredibly good. Additionally, the french toast was really thick and had been battered and fried to perfection. And the jalapeno burger was equally tasty. So in all, I loved this meal.

The fettuccine and pea dinner was equally bad?? what can explain this who know maybe the holiday weekend.??

They place the egg sunny side up in the center of the pizza and you use it as a sauce to dip the pizza in.  It was comforting and earthy.  For an entree the skate was amazing.

Karina M.,/user_details?userid=kgj66cYnRWExBnPhYD6Q6g,"Brooklyn, NY",4/27/2011,4.0,"Went there with a few friends last week when I was in NYC and we had a very delightful experience. The decor is done so perfectly - nice and trendy, but not over the top. The food - was wonderful. I am not sure that I have eaten that much food in a long time, but it was so delicious that I couldn't resist. We started with the marinated olives and spinach/quinoa salad.

Lentil soup was oily but upside down cranberry cake was pretty good.

Sonya B.,/user_details?userid=MAjHCJh96qKE_e7qh5i2LA,"New York, NY",11/14/2011,2.0,"This review applies specifically to their weekend brunch. ABC Kitchen is probably a better venue for dinner or some kind of evening meal. The restaurant was extremely dark for a mid-afternoon meal! I had to ask our server to figure out how to turn the light on above our table just so I could read the menu. Two women sat down at a table next to mine and they immediately asked to be re-seated at another table (they didn't have any additional lights that could be turned on). Found myself wishing I had done the same. Aside from these complaints, the food was only alright (some items were far too salty - i.e. cheddar chive biscuits).

First, I want to say that the space is absolutely beautiful and the staff, very sweet & accommodating. Unfortunately, the food was a huge disappointment. I had the gazpacho to start which I did not eat because it was loaded with tomato seeds & skin. It was very off putting. My companion had the kale salad which she found to be overdressed & boring. We each had the saffron spaghetti with ricotta. As served, it was literally inedible for us because of the amount of grease it sat in. It was as if the pasta, which was over cooked & under salted, was sitting in an oil soup. Luckily, one of the waitstaff noticed me moving it from the main plate to my bread dish & asked if all was well. They nicely replaced the dishes but the pasta was still meh - too spicy, under seasoned, too much parsley & too soft. Some Parmesan cheese would have helped I think. The highlight of the meal was the Carmel ice cream sundaes served with an elevated version of cracker jacks. One of the waiters recommended it over the chocolate cake & I am so happy we took his advice as it was outstanding!

But the mood is laid back and casual. The warmth we felt on entering the restaurant (early, and minus one in our party and they seated us right away and didn't make a fuss about our missing person) was particularly welcome given the dreadful cold rain outside. The food is delicious. I had the apple and pear salad, with perfect matchstick pieces of each; I could have eaten it for days, it was tart and fresh and crisp. I had a tender and perfect piece of cod. I'm kind of old fashioned--I tend to like my cod flaky and dry (i.e., fish and chips!), but this was tender, with a nice bite. This is one of the few places where I can honestly say that I want to go back and go back and go back so I can try more things. It's a bit pricey, so I won't be doing that soon, but I will definitely be back.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I had the soft shell crab, which unfortunately was nothing special but the fish dish they had replacing the monkfish (which we wanted to order but they were out of) was amazing.

Meredith B.,/user_details?userid=LR-1YuRy5RQegkSp_oXEWA,"New City, NY",8/13/2017,2.0,"We spent a few weeks researching a great place to celebrate our 10th anniversary with a brunch with our young (but well behaved) children and our parents who have refined palettes but like to eat food, not horse hay. Finally we settled on a reservation for 8 ppl at noon for brunch today, Sunday. While there were lots of friendly servers around the restaurant, somehow it took about 15 minutes for coffees to come out after we sat down and ordered them. Two out of four of the coffees arrived w sizable chips in the ceramic mugs and when asked to bring back a new mug that wouldn't cut our faces, we knew it would be ten more minutes until we saw the coffee again. We proceeded to order our meals. Beyond the French toast, I was shocked to see that none of the dishes looked remotely appealing. My Bibb salad with grilled chicken, (which cost $30!), arrived w four uncut lettuce leaves and some scattered veggies that looked like they were taken from my refrigerator at home. NOTHING special. My mother's egg omelette which was ordered plain (she has allergies) arrived full of veggies that she cannot eat. My husband's eggs arrived and literally looked like someone had already eaten the food off of his plate. After my daughter's pasta/butter came, it was spaghetti- which is the only pasta she won't eat. Penne, rigatoni are just more kid-friendly.  They subbed it for some scrambled eggs, which arrived with green garnish all over it. Really?! For a 4 year old?! Just annoying. My husband and I celebrated on our own last nite in pound ridge at Jean-georges' restaurant and it was worlds away from abc kitchen in terms of style, grace, presentation, and food quality and choices.

Its a nice size portion- scoops of caramel ice cream, popcorn and chocolate sauce- am sure I'm leaving out a bunch of ingredients but its just uber delicious.

I think this is the only time this place has been available for us to get a seat without a huge wait or a need for a reservation. highly recommend for brunch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

This place is perfection. The decor is simply gorgeous and not overdone, romantic dim lighting, rustic tables. It has a hip vibe but elegant and classy at the same time. The food is sensational as well as the accompanying sauces. To start we shared the calamari appetizer and after the first taste we agreed that it was the ""best calamari we've ever had""- it was served with 2 sauces, both spicy and tasty. Then we shared a scallop special which was perfectly cooked and had an amazing spicy creamy sauce with it. Then we had a whole wheat pizza with mushrooms, cheese, and an egg in the middle- I know, it sounds odd, but seriously it was outrageous.

We got drinks which were so great! My drink was very refreshing and it was their cucumber wine cooler or something like that. Who would have thought that you can get a cucumber flavor in wine?? However, the entree was probably where it didn't go as well as we had imagined. I got the black sea bass and she got the halibut. The sea bass still had BONES in there! It wasn't just one bone, it was 3-5. That disappointed me...the halibut on the other hand was sweet and tender. Everything was good but not up to where we had envisioned it to be.

We are in town only for a short time and the first thing we did was call the make reservations. Being the weekend, the available time for our size party(5) was limited as we were aware might be the case before calling. My wife called to make the original reservation and set a time before we had a chance to discuss the timing. While making the reservations asked if she could take the only available time for Friday and if it didn't work call back to change to Saturday. The person (Danny) on the phone said that would be fine. Within 2-3minutes we talked about it and decided to do Saturday instead and I called right back. The person I spoke with first told me the would be $45/person fee to cancel and make a new reservation. I explained to him it had only been made in the last 5 minutes. He said he would wave the fee and made a new reservation for us but before he hung up he said "" I fucking hate people"" and we I asked him to ""please tell me more"" he quickly hung up. Because of this extremely poor experience over the phone I decided to call and check on our reservation to only find out we didn't have one. So, needless to say we will not be eating there tonight and unfortunately will never on any future trip.

There were four or five people working in various capacities behind our bar (where they didn't produce any drinks at all, oddly) but no one person seemed responsible for us. They all seemed overwhelmed with running around doing other stuff. They didn't even make eye contact with us, lest they be asked for something.

She needs to be replaced with someone much friendlier. Just because this is a popular restaurant doesn't mean you can have an attitude with your potential customers. Because the time slots are so limited here I was asking if she could tell me what her availabilities were for two different nights. She got short and snippy when I asked her to repeat the times and told me that I should just go online and make the reservation there instead. I was shocked. I replied to her rude attitude with ""....ok?"" And she followed up with ""ok."" And hung up. It's her job to help the customers and when I did go online after she rudely cut me off and hung up I found much fewer options listed than she had previously given me.

Both fantastic, the first one lusciously so, but well-balanced by the crispness of the second. An excellent light start, opening up to an equally fab entree combo: seared scallops with pink peppercorn and a lemony veloute, accompanied by arctic char with sweet and normal potatoes in a decadent yet delightful sauce (such ability to combine those two sensations...). Everything was coursed out without us even asking, and the service was attentive without being overbearing. Opted for a local North Fork gewurztraminer at $50 and were not disappointed in that department either - great balance between acidity and fruitiness, with layers of texture oozing on the palate.

This is New York after all, and another new restaurant will open for me to venture to next week, and if not, I have my staple hole in the walls to fall back on for my favorite, spicy foods of choice.

Philip G.,/user_details?userid=0HT8n65X-BHycRPcE5pJqw,"Boone, NC",7/28/2011,3.0,"Went here for late(ish) lunch with friends from out of town. The place is stunning, with white tables and chairs, (mis)matched dinnerware and wooden ceiling. We were promptly seated by our friendly hostess. I'm gonna go ahead and rate the food, before i talk about the things i did not like about the place (more like hate). We ordered the chicken liver appetizer whilst waiting for one of our friends that was running late. It was absolutely delicious and buttery, almost foie-like. I ordered the buffalo mozzarella pizza and my friend the veal meatball pasta bowl. The food was A-ok, nothing to die for but reasonable. The thing i HATED about this place is the service...it's not that it's bad, it's that i hate when i am waiting for someone to eat lunch, and the waiter keeps coming back to try and get us to order without the full party. This happened four times in 20 minutes!!! I mean, c'mon, you can see we are not ready to order, our friend isn't here yet!! and it's not like it's 12 30 and the place is packed, it was 3 o'clock and we were one of three tables, the only one starting our meal, so there wasn't an issue of turning the table, it was more just to annoy us.

So much space that if it's just a couple of you and you don't fit at the many tables, you can likely find a seat at the bar. It's huge and yet it was packed for lunch on a weekday. My friend and I sat at the bar by the front door. I had the prix fixe lunch for $25, which is definitely worth it. The beet and yogurt salad is awesome; I didn't even know there were non-purple beets and I actually like them better! The hake was cooked very nicely and the mustard sauce was delicious, but my one complaint is that there was too much black pepper in the dish. My friend had the gazpacho, which was good and definitely tasted like strawberries, but not overwhelmingly so. We shared the strawberry dessert which was scrumptious! And lighter than others, I'm sure. I love the ambience, such wonderful decor. Great place!!

It was the perfect place for my family -- beautiful design, relaxed but elegant vibe, not too loud, and most importantly, AMAZING food!! Between the four of us, we got the crab toast, salmon tartare, and cauliflower dish to start. The crab toast was RIDICULOUS. I'm still thinking about it. A must-have for sure. Salmon tartare was also amazing. Perfectly grilled sourdough bread as the base for both the tartare and the crab toast. We ordered the cauliflower dish with the egg on the side because I don't eat eggs, even though the waitress cautioned us that it might be a little dry--It was THE MOST DELICIOUS CAULIFLOWER I've ever had in my life!! Even my dad who doesn't love vegetables like I do agreed. Then for our main dishes we had the house made spaghetti with chanterelles, the tomato basil pizza, the burger, and the sunchokes. The spaghetti is now one of my top five favorite pasta dishes (along Scarpetta's spaghetti, and Spago's sweet corn agnolotti), and the sunchokes were an amazing seasonal special. Definitely get them while you can! I did not try the burger but they loved it, and the pizza was solid. I've definitely had better as far as the dough but their tomato sauce is really delicious. The pinot noir and blood orange bellini were also excellent with the meal. And for dessert, I had heard so much about their salted caramel sundae that we had to try it and it definitely lived up to the hype!! We also got the doughnuts that were perfectly light and airy. All in all it was an unforgettable meal. ABC Kitchen is definitely my new favorite restaurant in NYC!

I love the peaceful decor, the service was so friendly from the hostess to the server, and the food concept of market to table, organic, locally grown is my favorite.

Ask first ""is this dish fried"" for any dish you want.  I think from a health standpoint, it was not a good meal for me.  The flavors were good, but again, heavy oiled. I will go back and carefully ask about each dish.  The goat cheese pizza with spinach was very good and the wild striped bass was also good.  Wine selection is very good.  They offered a truffle pizza for 92 which is over the top in my opinion but I hope someone who tries it will write a review.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We had read rave reviews about their mushroom, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza which sounded both interesting and weird. So of course we had to try it. I thought it was one of the best gourmet pizzas I've ever had. Dessert was the vanilla cream donuts with a bacon fudge sauce that our server recommended.

I ordered beets with yoghurt and the fried organic chicken and my hubby went for the halibut. I couldn't believe how a simple dish like beets and yoghurt could taste so sophisticated and my chicken was tender and delicious. Hubby definitely like the halibut. All we did was to talk about the place, utensils, plates and what an extraordinary job they did for the place. Another important point for was their ingredients were organic and local.

Lauren D.,/user_details?userid=CAgahu7A9qc2DjII1WB77g,"Far Hills, NJ",1/4/2012,5.0,"ABC Kitchen is absolutely phenomenal but definitely requires advance planning because reservations go very quickly! After visiting on Sunday, ABC is definitely in my top 3 NYC restaurants.  The restaurant is beautiful inside, with great chandeliers and an almost country feel which fits with its organic/locavore menu. First off, our waiter was super enthusiastic. When we asked about the food, instead of just telling us his favorite, he launched into an entire speech about texture which was different but made sense in light of the food. We started off with crab toast with lemon aioli and the roast carrot and avocado salad with crunchy seeds, sour cream and citrus, two of their specialty appetizers. The two were quite different but both phenomenal. The crab toast had great but simple flavor and the carrot was well seasoned and the salad was an amazing meld of flavors. Instead of getting a drink at dinner, I tried their housemade ginger and lime soda. Even though I'm not much of a soda drinker, this was amazing. It wasn't overly sweet at all and the flavor was very distinct and a great complement to the meal. For our entrees, I got cornflake crusted skate with kale and sweet potatoes and my boyfriend got their fried chicken with collard greens and hot sauce butter. Both were fantastic. The skate had a great crunch from the cornflake and the plating with the sweet potato and kale was a great seasonal mix. The fried chicken is one of ABC's specialities and while I am definitely not a fried chicken girl, it was phenomenal. The inside was so juicy and flavorful and I was definitely happy to take a few bites as it was a massive piece. For desert, we went for the famous sundae with salted caramel ice cream, candied peanuts and popcorn and chocolate sauce which was to quote our waiter, ""indulgent"". It was definitely large and needs to be split but absolutely delicious. Clearly, I'm a huge ABC fan and can't wait for another trip back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

When we first arrived we were seated and finally had to flag someone down just to get a drink order in and a glass of water. Granted I know it was Father's Day but e waited over 30mins just to get a greeting, a drink etc. After that it was another hour before we received our appetizers and the entire night continuing like this. Every time we needed a drink or to place an order for another course we had to flag someone down. We never really seen our waitress more than one other time during the service (which was fine) cause she seemed very unpleasant and in a bad mood. I assumed they pull tips but I felt bad for the bread guy and the water boy doing all the work. Anyways after watching five tables around is come & go with full service I was staring to feel it was personal. Not a god feeling for your special birthday dinner. Anyways we complained to the manager and she comped our drinks. Not sure if that was enough since we paid over $200 for horrible service if lack if it and it took up my entire night. Which my fiancé had to work in the morning and we didn't leave until almost 1am. Don't think I'll be back. Bummed because this was a beautiful restaurant and the food was good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/abc-kitchen-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Vivienne H.,/user_details?userid=B4N5RADPxTar14osjtcsGA,"New York, NY",8/6/2010,5.0,"I LOVE this place. I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it. After a friend recommended that we try a friday night dinner here, I was sold the instant I walked in. The decor was out of this world-gorgeous, delicate chandeliers, natural wood cut tables, ornate bread china, even the water drinking glasses were of spectacular design. The restaurant was perfectly lit with spectacular decor. I felt like I was inside a majestic jewelry box. Absolutely NO detail is overlooked. Now onto the food. Being a Jean Georges restaurant, you know that the standards are extremely high. The waiter recommended a deliciously light red wine  (the tempranillo). My friend and I shared the ricotta ravioli, the crispy organic chicken, and the chef gave us a free side of the corn--all absolutely delicious and gorgeously presented. For desert we had the salted caramel ice cream (with chocolate sauce and caramel popcorn), which was probably one of the most mouthwatering desserts I've had to enjoy in NYC thus far--the balance of the salt and sweetness was divine. The service was friendly and on point, and the experience overall was spectacular.

Out of what we ordered, the corn dumplings, oxtail spring roll, and cauliflower were the standouts. I was tempted to get another order of the corn dumplings - they weren't what I expected and unlike anything I've tried before, but the combination of the savory corn and parmigiano with the truffle salsa was a touch of genius. We also got the rice with octopus which I thought I'd love since I'm a huge congee/juk fan but found a bit bland. The injeolmi mousse was honestly one of the best restaurant desserts I've had -- definitely don't skip it, it was a perfect ending to the meal.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mokyo-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We had a total of 6 dishes between two of us( they are small tapa style dishes) and we finished every last bite. We left full and content. My favorite was definitely the pork jowl. It was super tender and had a buttery texture. The corn dumplings reminded me of Thursday's kitchens truffled Mac and cheese which is my favorite dish from Thursday's so that was amazing. The mini lobster rolls and the gumbo also did not disappoint. Other than the amazing food, our server Sophie was such a joy to be around and gave us the best experience.

The drinks were served in giant adult Capri sun pouches with a light on the bottom, which amused us to no end. On top of the silly but cute presentation, the drinks were great! I recommend the pure strawberry and the mojito. But the stars of the night were there dishes, specifically the cauliflower, oxtail spring roll, Berkshire rib, and noodle dishes. I would also recommend the sweet plantain and and crudo. The beet tostada was good, but I'd be fine skipping it, and the pink lady apple was the least favorite of the bunch.

Our waiter was very kind and explained all the dishes as they came out. He also gave us complimentary sake shots, which was a nice touch. We also ordered the lychee mango and blah blah blue cocktails. The lychee mango is the most popular but I preferred the blah blah blue.

Joanne L.,/user_details?userid=htJcrxtelar85UYX5OxkIA,"Washington, DC",8/14/2021,5.0,"Had a wonderful dinner here. The drinks are super fun and delicious - they come in pouches with light bulbs. The server recommended 2-3 dishes per person for sharing and two of us got 5. Every dish is outstanding. My favorites are the steak and grilled octopus on rice, both very well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The corn dumplings have a very interesting texture - the filling tastes like corn soup. The cauliflower is also good - sweet, sour, and sticky. The only thing to note is that for the price point, the portion size is small.

Vinson T.,/user_details?userid=swoVG5RL13lCm_Ivc1Yk0g,"New York, NY",1/29/2022,5.0,"Cute little Korean tapas spot in the east village. Interesting menu with creative flavors! The corn dumplings were very savory, and you can definitely taste the truffle in the silky filling.  The oxtail spring roll was one of my favorite items and a must order! The steak was just okay, nothing really amazing to scream about. The yellowtail crudo had an interesting sauce that reminded me of the dipping sauce for viet summer rolls lol and the lobster rolls were really tiny (2 bites max) but good. My other favorite dish was the rice with octopus, really flavorful and the octopus was cooked perfectly and not chewy at all! Expect to order 2 to 3 plates per person, as the the portions aren't that big, as expected for tapas.  Definitely make reservations because it's pretty popular, and was poppin even on a snowey Friday night.

Just don't even read this review or anyone else's review because everyone has different palates and taste preferences but literally. Just go. Check out Mokyo. From the food to service, everything was delightful and wonderful. I can't believe how delicious every dish was. Each dish came out at a great pace and the server explained every dish in detail. My friends and I shared the oxtail spring rolls, yellowtail crudo, scallops, CAULIFLOWER, corn dumplings, octopus and rice, and Berkshire ribs. Oh my. Each dish had such a complex flavor profile. The corn dumplings evolved in my mouth - at first I thought too creamy, but it became nutty, savory, sweet - all in one bite. The scallops were cooked PERFECTLY. I hate over-cooked scallops but these ones were amazing. The cauliflower was the star because the bite was crisp - both inside and outside. Every component on that dish served it's purpose and I couldn't get enough of it. My friend loved the octopus and rice - to the extent that she said she would ask for it as a last meal. Gosh, so proud of what chef Kay has achieved and the marriage between Korean and Spanish cuisine.

We originally had a rezzie for Thursday Kitchen but due to my lactose allergy we couldn't eat much of the food. When we came to MOKYO, the waiter walked us through every dish, telling us the ingredients and what substitutions we could make - which we could do for almost every dish. Despite coming with no reservation, which I would recommend, they were able to seat the two of us for 1.5 hours, which was enough time. Pork jowl was the star, with it being just as described by the waiter - crispy on the outside and soft and chewy (and very fatty) on the inside. Personally, a close second for me the was the gumbo - super flavorful, not really sure how to describe it though so you just have to believe me! Cauliflower kind of tasted just like marinated chicken wings, so would skip on ordering this. The rice was super soft, as was the octopus. You couldn't really taste that it was octopus but the dish was still worth getting. Spring rolls were crunchy with a great sauce on the side. Our meal came out to $80 for 2 people, so if you have a budget - be careful since it's easy to order a lot given they are tapas and everything is pretty good.

Nick R.,/user_details?userid=bMMHSUVTSqY5N9o3b_VYVQ,"Chicago, IL",3/26/2021,5.0,"This place was absolutely delicious!!! When we ordered we asked the waitress what the best dishes were and she suggested the lobster roll, corn dumplings, and pork jowl and they did not disappointed! Each of those dishes were so flavorful and tasty it was like an explosion of goodness in my mouth with each bite. The corn dumplings were incredibly unique in their flavor profile, it is hard to describe. The sauce was slightly sour and balanced well with the starchy flavor of the corn filling inside the dumpling. The pork jowl was so soft, it practically melted in your mouth, and was incredibly well seasoned. The lobster roll was my personal favorite as the bread was so soft and the lobster was perfectly cooked with a wonderful sauce to top it off. The other items we ordered were definitely not as good as the first three. The plantain katsu was boring compare to those other dishes and it just didn't have as much flavor. The pistachio sauce definitely helped with the flavor but overall it was not as good. The oxtail spring rolls were fairly average and the sauce didn't add much flavoring to it. The meat was very soft and cooked well but it lacked seasoning in my opinion. My least favorite item was the gumbo as I just didn't liked the seasoning and it tasted the most generic to me. I enjoyed the pop rocks dessert though as the ice cream wasn't too sweet but had a thick texture that paired well with the fun pop rocks. Overall, I would definitely order those first three dishes, maybe even a couple of each because they will impress.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mokyo-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Maxine T.,/user_details?userid=1No2XF4B3aUeQCXC2bUpOA,"Rochelle Park, NJ",8/15/2020,5.0,"Ordered the pork jowl, corn dumplings, gumbo, potato crisps and calamari. The pork jowl in particular was really good -- it literally melts in your mouth!! Would definitely get this if ordering here for the first time. The potato crisps were also a hit. Very attentive staff. Also I accidentally forgot my credit card on the table when I left, and a helpful staff ran after me for more than a block to return it. Was super grateful and wished I had thanked him more, but he ran back to the restaurant in a flash.

Maggie C.,/user_details?userid=AA723geS4ytI2G50MP-W5w,"Flushing, NY",5/21/2021,3.0,"Sort of disappointed :( My table ordered one of everything (except for the fish) and we only really enjoyed the pork jowl (absolutely delicious!). The other dishes were alright in our opinion. Cauliflower was drenched in the sauce (way too strong), steak had no sear, the rice with octopus was super salty and we couldn't finish it, etc. Portion sizes were really small for the price. Also I didn't like how there was such a long waiting period between getting served each dish - for a while we thought we were finished with our food since nothing came for ~15 mins but then 4 plates suddenly made their way through, so I wish they could've all been served at the same time/with not that long of a waiting period. The indoor seating area was also very hot and the water they served had no ice lol. Also, we had a birthday cake and they said it was $3/pp for the cake fee but when they took it out they didn't provide us with plates, forks, or cut it (which is usually the standard if you're paying the cake fee?) In the end I don't believe they charged us but I feel like if you're not ""serving"" the cake then $3/pp as a cake fee (esp for a large party) seems a bit much for simply keeping it in the fridge. Other than the food and service, the waiters were very nice and the drinks were good! For 6 people we spent $400 including tax and tip - so like $67 per person :( Not worth especially when everyone was still hungry in the end.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mokyo-new-york-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

One of us got there early to put our name down and the host said 45 min and logged us in on his ipad. Which was interesting because there were tables open. Then once we all arrived we checked back with the host again and we saw his ipad just had our name and a timer next to it showing how much time our of 45 min its been. So we were waiting for an ipad timer instead of which tables we're clearing up. We were sat at a table that we'd been starring at since we walked in that was free the entire time. The menu was great and the idea of small korean tapas is fun but I don't recommend going there with a big appetite. We had 9 plates between the 3 of us and were still hungry. The plates we're delicious though... Some of our favorites were steak, duck rice, and dumplings.
