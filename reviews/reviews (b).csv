If you don't have a res, you will have to wait quite a while, so I would recommend that you make a res before coming. I got the HK Kong cocktail drink and it was quite sweet, with a hint of coffee. There was a bit of whipped cream on top and it tasted like a dessert liquor drink! Would recommend. The portion was a bit small but still very cute."

The service was slow which it something to keep in mind if you are coming here for lunch and only have one hour. The waitress was very nice and helpful. I ate the lobster bisque for an appetizer and main course I had the salmon po boy. My date had the shrimp appetizer which was very good. The lobster bisque had a tart taste which was unexpected and had pieces of lobster in it. The salmon po boy was interesting it was more of a salmon burger which the waitress did inform me of. It tasted fresh and flavorful. I did enjoy this place and would be back for happy hour.

Staff was very friendly, and the interior is more upscale than your typical sports bar. In terms of the food, my party ordered the salmon, the pasta, and the turkey BLTA. I say this with any bar that I visit -- don't expect bars/pubs to make great dinner entrees. I often find that bars don't do the best job preparing actual restaurant dishes such as salmon and pasta. Stick to the simpler things like the turkey BLAT or even a burger. You can't go wrong with those.

Mikayla K.,/user_details?userid=mXQtvpvudLMJaq0lXDaobg,"Edina, MN",8/8/2022,5.0,I work in sales and come to New York about 2x per month. Each time I love wandering around my hotel and finding a new restaurant to try. I found myself wanting a good salmon dish around 8-9pm but a lot of the typical recommendations were closing. I stumbled upon The Malt House as I was looking for dinner because of the curb appeal. There are big windows to give a sneak peak of what's inside. I am SO happy I decided to stop because their Scottish salmon dish was to die for. I chose a sour to drink but they have plenty of beer and a full bar. A nice elegant environment that is also the opposite of stuffy.

Ingrid S.,/user_details?userid=vXAUaZSn7reLfjLk73MeeA,"Brooklyn, NY",7/8/2019,3.0,"You know what kinds of happy hours I hate? The kind that ends at 6pm. I work almost across the street and its still a hustle to get over here for a drink before it ends. Every time i've tried to even check out the place, its been packed beyond belief. In the sense that good luck on trying to even find room to get up to the bar to order a drink because bros by the dozens are raging with their popped collars tonight. An additional thing that is crumby, I know there is a second location in the west village. I've actually been there as well and its better. Why? Because everything on the menu is about $1-2 cheaper and their happy hour actually runs till 7pm. I don't really get it because I never saw anything special about fidi. Also, putting drinks in wee little mason jars pisses me off sometimes when I want a proper pint. The only reason why this is 3 stars instead of two is because I've had their west village location's cheese curds (same menu) and they are divine. Also, the fact that food is included on the happy hour menu - awesome. I just wish the two restaurants weren't so vastly different because of their neighborhoods.

Lots of draft beer and whiskey selections to choose from. The awesome waitress recommended the toffee flavored dessert and didn't disappoint.

And the chicken wings were extraordinary.  Little louder than I like with the after-work crowd but this does lend to the liveliness. Although rated for 'kid friendliness' I think that is not 100% accurate. The seating is fine for families but the general crowd is more of the after work cocktail crowd. Additionally the food, although wonderful, is more geared to the spicy palate. So my wife and 12 year old enjoyed the food, but it was a little spicy for my 6 year old.

Really a hidden gem tucked in the middle of the block on  maiden lane a few blocks north of Wall st.  Service was a bit slow for lunch time hence the 4 stars.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-malt-house-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Now i order from 3 other restaurants in the area but all my guest were asking is where I had ordered the above items from, they were great everyone gave them rave reviews the Lamb Lollis and Cubanos were a favorite of everyone I should have ordered more but now i know this going forward for future events.

Nicholas A.,/user_details?userid=HxxrQcg682AMp_Y7InHMDg,"Great Neck, NY",8/13/2018,2.0,"I was rather disappointed with this establishment. As someone who visits the city on a regular basis I often find myself exploring new restaurants and bars to keep up the variation and excitement. Most recently me and a group of friends found ourselves at The Malt House for brunch and I have to say our experience could not have been more disappointing. First off the bottomless mimosas were horrendous. The mimosas arrived at our table in dirty plastic jugs and were heavily watered down. In addition, I ordered the chicken and waffles as part of the bottomless brunch which arrived at the table in a sloppy mess. This only led to further disappointment with the chicken being cold and the waffle being soggy. Everything was way overpriced considering the terrible quality and lack of service. If you enjoy watered down drinks, slow service, and cold food then I highly recommend The Malt House.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-malt-house-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The menu looks good, a lot of flavorful dishes are listed, but there was something off about my food, terribly reheated. This was a perfect spot for a late night date, and I would consider going back on the weekend for their bottomless brunch. I recognized some of the menu items, like the cabbage salad, from another local spot, and I didn't like it there so I didn't order it here even though I really wanted a salad. The salad options were very weird, a sweet summer strawberry salad (in winter) or this crunchy cabbage salad. I could have gone for a simple garden salad or some sort of vegetable dish. Avoid this place at all costs if you are vegan or allergic to dairy because there is cheese on every single item, even items without cheese listed, and the (V)s on the menu refer to cheesy vegetarian items, definitely not vegan. If you want flavorful bar food, chill ambience, and good drinks, this is a good spot.

Upstairs the bar is okay, little louder and more open, and typical of a FiDi happy hour locale. Service upstairs is typically quite good as bartenders here are attentive and respectful.

The lighting was muted and the ambiance was intimate. Everything on the menu sounded delicious and I wound up ordering the southern fried chicken, it was cooked perfectly and the sides were incredible. It comes with a chipotle mash and Mexican shaved corn, I could eat those every day. The chicken was cooked 3/4 perfectly, one piece was a little burnt and over cooked but it was far from inedible. My girlfriend ordered the tacos and she loved them, they were spicy and had nice big slices of fresh avocado.

Wouldn't come back for brunch ever. The service was beyond slow - almost embarrassingly. We got bottomless brunch. I can kick back many a mimosa - I got 3 because the service was so slow. They got my cousins last drink wrong after she waited almost 45 minutes for it and we couldn't even tell them because we never saw the waitress again until after we paid the bill. Someone else had to bring us the bill even though she was still working. The waitress had a horrible attitude from the start and just seemed like she didn't want to be there. We asked for another drink at the end despite being slightly past our two hours ( didn't drink until 1 and it was 3:30)  to which she responded you're already 2 hours past your time. First how about check your math? Second don't back talk the customer EVER. We were polite the way we asked. We said well the service was a bit slow to which she back talked AGAIN and said well your drinks were full the whole time. Au contraire - my drink was empty almost the whole time maybe one person in our party had a full drink.  She could have just given us another round of the watered down mimosas but instead wanted to pick a fight which I think says a lot. She was despicable. The table was also TINY and we sat on stools which isn't my favorite. Overall won't be coming back from brunch.

Jeanne C.,/user_details?userid=oWR8XVbCbnfZ7OtEWP0m4w,"Brooklyn, NY",8/31/2015,3.0,"Don't be shy and balk at the large crowd huddled by the bar. The crowd is sometimes what defines a place for me but when you enter, you are immediately greeted by a host and pleasantly surprised at the amount of seats available towards the back. They've got a great selection of draught beer and a wide selection of drinks with a nice sampling of house cocktails. We came with a group of six for happy hour on a Wednesday and ordered the chicken wings, truffle fries, and fried pickles. Great bar food and a variety of dipping sauce. Good savory food to pair with your awesome drinks!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-malt-house-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Gary R.,/user_details?userid=MsZBGO9KQBt67sk-T4GO0Q,"Ashburn, VA",12/7/2015,3.0,Great beer list albeit pricey.  Burger was over cooked but tasty.   Wings could have used more heat.  Service was super fast - almost too fast.  Atmosphere solid.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-malt-house-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Their troufle fries are yummy! I had the lobster bisque which was good and their burger was ok.

George M.,/user_details?userid=tPKELIJEoj4NvUZ-GLSCWQ,"Chantilly, VA",7/14/2018,2.0,Below average customer service. Bartender is not that interested in most customers at the bar. She is more interested in the co workers. Rosemary fries pretty good but wings burned with lots of hot sauce. Overpriced for what you get.

Rashi V.,/user_details?userid=v4JsdeDQsUphAXSMXc4rwg,"Jersey City, NJ",8/10/2015,5.0,"I would give this place 7 stars if  I could. We recently had a corporate event here and everything was absolute perfection. They booked us in the private ""Board Room"" upstairs, and the ambience and style couldn't have been better for what we were going for- it was a perfect mix of sophistication without being stiffly daunting, elegantly casual and fun. The place was buzzing as early as 4 PM on a Friday - no small feat for a location in FiDi. Special shout out to Leland for being extremely cooperative and an absolute pleasure to work with while making the arrangements. We went with the Happy Hour menu and the margaritas were delicious, as were the truffle fries. I'll be looking for opportunities to bring friends and coworkers here- loved it!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-malt-house-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
