I came with my partner for a Valentine's Day dinner/ restaurant week dinner, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.

Waitress was very friendly and shared a bunch of recommendations. Started with the moules which were decent. We paired that with the gougeres which were a fun little puff pastry with a nice cheese flavoring. Next we had the steak tartare, which again was pretty good, I especially appreciated the cornichons that came with it. For a main I went with the steak frites and was disappointed. Ordered medium rare and was a little overdone, but the char on the outside just gave it an overpowering burnt taste. No real flavor, no sauce to go with it, just burnt and salt. My girlfriend had the trout which was a bit better but nothing special. Overall probably wouldn't go back with all if the other options around.

I have only been there twice, but I wass impressed on both occasions. The first time I went to French Louie was during  restaurant week. My friend and I ordered the mussels, pate, and steak frites. Everything was absolutely delicious. More recently, a friend and I came for brunch and we had such a lovely time. We ordered the eggs louie (benedict) and the creme brûlée french toast and let me tell you.... that benedict was sooooooo amazing. The hollandaise and the crab tasted so yummy together. I wouldn't be mad if they added more crab to the mix though ;) The french toast was something else, so unique and delicious with the sweet blueberry preserves. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal- I'm still drooling over that benedict.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/french-louie-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My first call to French Louie was such a positive exchange that in my mind, I was going to continue trying to get a table even though the time slot - 7:00 - that I wanted was booked. Persistence paid off as I was able to get a table for 7:15 after trying several other places and failed to get an early slot.

I must say it was a perfect little spot to celebrate and local to us too. We got greeted by a very pleasant girl on our arrival and wished happy anniversary which was sweet. We got offered a table outside which was perfect as the evening was rather pleasant. We decided to celebrate with a bottle of bubbly, oysters and fois Gras to start with followed by steak and moules.

Can't say I had the best experience nor was it awful. The food was hit and miss. The pate was delicious. Creamy and full of flavor. The escargots was great. Awesome sauce and great combination of flavors on the plate. Steak tarte was good but slightly underseason. The duck confit was pretty good. The meat fell right off the bone and the skin was nice and crispy. The Steak frites was nothing special. The Steak was very average and the fries fried nicely but to salty. For dessert the lemon cake actually tasted old and stale. Bread pudding was average. Now for the service. Not great. They were attentive but not friendly at all. I sensed snootiness.Our first server seemed to get upset with how we ordered and not specifying it was the restaurant week prixe fix. We also was never asked if we wanted go order drinks. In mid meal we changed to a different server. Again not friendly at all. She told us our choices for dessert was a lemon cake and chocolate gateau. We order one each. When it came we got tbe lemon cake and a bread pudding. When we told the runner we were suppose to get a chocolate gateau she said no you order bread pudding. It wasn't that big of a deal so didn't want to argue. When the server came with the check we told her you gave us bread pudding she said ""oh yes they just changed it."" I think the right thing was she should have informed us and make sure it was ok. It was almost as if since it was restaurant week they'll just get what we give. There was no care what so ever. Also, when I told her the fries were too salty she hust said ok. No apology nothing. During the whole meal no one came to check of us. They did do a good job clearing the table.

We got the sardines, mussels, 28 day steak, red rice, and chickpea pancake. While the sardines were good, there were only two of them. The mussels were in a heavy sauce that was a tad too heavy for my liking. The 28 steak was not prepared according to our request, and it was basically overcooked. Now, considering the price of the steak, I would imagine that the care for this meat would be better. The red rice was interesting as it was mixed with greens. The chickpea pancake was probably our favorite item on our table, and it was very original as well. The downside is the noise. In fact, the table next to us was so loud that my left ear was ringing the next day. The tables are on top of each other, and the couple next to us overheard us talking about the noise level. They agreed that it was unbearable.

Honest R.,/user_details?userid=qootAccifN8IcMwUP18k1g,"Brooklyn, NY",2/18/2018,3.0,I wanted to love this place but was a little disappointed. I was here for brunch and ordered the regular bloody Mary (virgin) and felt it was a little too sour. Maybe vodka makes a big difference. I ordered the special- duck hash with a sunnyside egg- pretty tasty but very small portion. I also ordered the creme brulee french toast. I thought that was pretty good but would be much better as a desert. I decided to add on the avocado tartine because I didn't feel satisfied with my french toast. The avocado spread was just like guacamole and they did put a lot. It also has a lot of citrus so the pickled tomatoes didn't really go well but it was really pretty. The bread was overly toasted so the edges were impossible to cut through. I cut out the center and scraped the rest of the avocado off. The table next to me ordered a sandwich and the woman was putting in some serious work to try to cut through her toasted bread as well. It might've been a bad day or batch of bread. I also had the side of chicken sausage. For $7 skip it completely. It was really dry and small- just order another plate for a few more dollars. Another thing I wasn't happy about was when I asked to move to the table next to me because I was going to order more food and the table was already full. This table was a little bigger and for two people. When I arrived one person was sitting at the table so I didn't think it would be a problem for my party of two to switch over. The server asked the manager and they denied our request. They said a bigger party will be coming. Well literally 2 minutes later the host walks over a party of two and seats them at the table. When the rest of our food came out the waitress wasn't even sure where to put the plate because out table was full so we literally had to eat with our plates hanging off the sides of the table.Pretty bummed about our experience especially since it has such good reviews.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/french-louie-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My friend ordered the trout which I tried a little of - that was delicious. To finish off, I ordered the chocolate ganache cake with hibiscus mousse. This was slightly underwhelming...my friend ordered the profiteroles with ice cream which was spot on.

My husband and I came here for our anniversary and the food and service was impeccable from start to finish. The scallop ceviche was light and refreshing. The gnocchi was insanely good and my husband got the 28-day steak which was delicious. We finished it off with the pineapple tart which my husband didn't want to share after he tasted how delicious it was.

My boyfriend was a little late because parking in the area is notoriously bad, but they didn't rush me at all which was lovely. We ordered the Eggs Louie and the Trout Po Boy. The Eggs Louie were absolutely fantastic! Rich, creamy, buttery, definitely not a health-kick meal, but really great for a treat. My boyfriend said the Trout Po Boy was delicious, and something like he'd never tasted before. We really enjoyed the food here, but there was one thing that really killed the mood, hence the -1...it's so dang loud in there!! I don't know if its echo-y ceilings, loud music, or perhaps this midwesterner still isn't used to the Brooklyn brunch crowd, but it was unreasonably loud. I could not hear was my boyfriend was saying and he was sitting directly across from me.

Found it here!  I walked in and was immediately able to sit at the bar. Ordered the duck breast with mashed potatoes and olive spread, ""Allard."" I ordered it medium rare. It was phenomenal!!  The duck was a nice portion and included the skin. And if you truly love duck, then you wouldn't want to miss out on the skin. It was tender, juicy and so full of flavor!  The potatoes were great. The olives left me with the desire to make a serious effort to try to incorporate more olives into my daily schedule. I almost settled up and left after that until I realized that they had desserts!!  Ordered profiteroles with fennel ice cream and a nice drizzle of sugary goo. It was the perfect dessert!  And it really represented French portions and flavors well. Not swimming in goo. Just enough to make you enticed to sop it all up with the flaky, croissant-like profiteroles as the fennel ice cream melted. I told the bartender who served me with a smile the whole time that if I could, I would have licked the entire plate clean. The ice cream was just delicious. Thick, dense, fresh ice cream that really left me satisfied. The only down point of the experience was when I left to walk back to the apartment we are staying in and realized that I could have been dining here since Tuesday!  But we leave to return to our home in Atlanta tomorrow. Wish I could have eaten here again and again. And I truly hope they remain successful for next time I am in town so I can eat the exact same menu items.

They are now using those thimble-sized little ""coupe"" glasses that so many bars are now using for cocktails. There is nothing worse than ordering a cocktail and receiving it in one of those offensively tiny glasses, especially a martini. 2. The steak comes with salad. What happens when you put a hot piece of meat on the same plate as salad? Not only was the salad wilted, but tonight, half the salad was actually rotten. Garbage. Had to scrape it to the side after inadvertently eating rotten salad with my steak. Overall, I am sad that I can't depend on my neighborhood go-to French Louie anymore, for a great martini and steak dinner. Especially for the price, it should be very consistent and reliable.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/french-louie-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Matthew S.,/user_details?userid=WJ6YiRL9VdNlmYB1GZyPzA,"New York, NY",6/8/2014,2.0,"So I had kept seeing French Louie pop up on a the hot and trendy lists. I also saw that  they had worked out the initial kinks that new restaurants face. After finally eating there I have to say, I don't get it. We ordered the pork and rabbit rillettes as an appetizer, it had the consistency of tuna salad and didn't have much flavor. It even looked like it had rolled over onto its side when the waiter was bringing it out even though it was upright when it made it to the table. For my entree I had ordered the roast duck breast Allard. When it was served it was served with the grey side up which made for an ugly presentation. I had flipped it over to see the whole piece and there was a nice crisp skin that was sitting in the jus that would have made the presentation 100% better if it was served that way. Aside from the presentation I had also found it a little over cooked and tough. I had tried my girlfriends also, she had ordered the roasted king mushroom and while it was ok, it seemed to miss what it was aiming for, there were earthy tones but the sauce was overly salty sweet and sour all at the same time. She had also noted that the pieces of potato she had in there were under cooked. Aside from the food, the service was nothing to write home about. Our waitress came over and then disappeared for a extended periods of time. By the time we were done with our meal we were itching for the check and still couldn't locate out waitress,which after a mediocre meal can be frustrating because you just want to leave it all behind.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/french-louie-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

However, she did give us a menu for us to take a look despite the restaurant not opening for another 45 minutes. Fine again. But as we were walking out of the restaurant, we could hear the hostess laughing with the other restaurant staff about how dumb our question was. Firstly I don't think any service establishment should allow staff to talk about their customers in that way, especially if the customers are still around and as a result I give this restaurant a zero for its service and I am sure I won't be back to try the food as there are just too many other choices in Brooklyn for me to choose from.

Jon M.,/user_details?userid=JhBmlIR6_i0XjmhsbAtruw,"Manhattan, NY",11/3/2014,4.0,"We intended to dine at La Vara but lost our table thanks to the Brooklyn Bridge being closed to traffic. (No fault to the restaurant... we blame Mayor de Blasio and the MTA for being an hour late for our reservation!) So -- finding ourselves all the way in the area between Boerum Hill and the Slope in Brooklyn, we franticly scoured Yelp on our IPhone for something we could walk to with ease. On Atlantic Avenue was a place I had heard about from friends... French Louie. Let's start with the hostess -- as warm, friendly, charming a professional as one would hope to engage on a frustrating evening. She went out of her way to accommodate our party even though the place was packed -- and it was a Saturday night! Now let's move to the physical restaurant -- a neat bar, small, intimate, very ""Brooklyn hip"" without being douche, and a restaurant that is not overly loud, elegant without being pretentious, warm, inviting... we instantly felt very comfortable. (There is a large, outdoors back dining area that must be delightful in the summer.) Now... the menu. EVERYTHING sounded delicious... with the small-plates reading as inviting as the entrees. We shared an order of gougeres (small, cheese-filled puffs) and roasted brussels sprouts with grains in a harissa yogurt. Wonderful. The ""Frenchie"" salad was far more delicious than the simple detailing on the menu -- the bacon was hand-cut and perfect. Most of us opted for different steak/frites dishes -- the aged-steak was perfect and each of our meals came to the exact specification of what we ordered -- be it rare, medium rare, etc. We got what we wanted. The only disappointment was at desert... the spiced chocolate pot de creme with orange madeleines was insane... craving it now just thinking about it... but the house-made ice cream (that evening coconut) unfortunately had too many ice-crystals to make it stand out. That was the ONLY less-than-perfect aspect to this fine restaurant. Did I mention that the service was impeccable?  Attentive without being annoying.

Jerry L.,/user_details?userid=dXOV0wBcViWf7TYvy2ItbA,"New Rochelle, NY",8/22/2022,4.0,"This place is pretty unassuming when you first enter, you'd think this place was just a small bar with a few seats but when you get taken through to the seating area you'll see there is more indoor and outdoor seating. My friend made a reservation for Saturday at 5:30 and we were able to be seated right away. All the staff was very nice, we really liked the ambiance and the decor, one thing that was funny was the little water cup, now they did keep our cups filled but it was just enough to take a swallow of water before someone had to come back around and fill it up again. Now this menu is very unique and besides some things like guacamole this menu looked nothing like I'd ever seen in a Mexican restaurant, now that's not really a bad thing because the food was really good and of great quality, we got the guacamole which instead of being served with tortilla chips was served with 3 tortillas that were of the same consistency of a chip, no complaints it was great and had a little spice to it, you can tell they didn't over do it with salt and instead used herbs and spices, that's important to me. We got the duck appetizer which was unique and good, we also got the Taco De Trompo which also was good but really $9 for a taco? Now it was unique I have to give them that but really overpriced in my opinion, we shared the Asado which is a 26 oz steak, it's served with some cheese with fig we think and tortillas also with a green sauce, now the quality of this steak is great, well flavored but not overly seasoned and can easily be shared by 3-4 people, you definitely pay a lot for it but it's good, what I didn't like is when we finished the tortillas and were offered more we expected that it would be complimentary considering the amount we paid for it but I was disappointed later to see that we were charged for it, now in comparison to the price of the total bill it was small change but it's the principle in my mind, this is a unique place that is very pricey but it's also unlike any Mexican place I've been to before, the drinks are pricey as well, it's a good place to check out but for my budget I couldn't come here too often.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aldama-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

It's the most expensive on the menu. And it is awful. Besides being almost nothing other than mole - a few tiny  mushrooms, that's it - the mole tastes burnt with a charcoal aftertaste.

""Despite his history serving drinks at top-tier restaurants, Reyes wants Aldama to be an approachable, everyday hangout. ""I don't want to have a hundred different tequilas and mezcals on our wall,"" he says. Instead, the bar is focusing on 10 bottles of each, available for sipping from copitas with slices of oranges. A happy hour -- 5 to 7 p.m. daily -- advertises frozen margaritas and beer and mezcal shot combos for $10 or less."".....  There was no mezcal selection, only one cocktail list with 6 drinks ($14 each), one with mezcal....and it was frozen...I'd assume since the founder of the establishment is a bartender, the drinks would be more impressive...to each their own. Food menu was short as well and did not wow me either (and we ordered everything with the exception of the guacamole) There are only 2 meat options on the menu, both are small plates.  One is the cecina; thinly sliced, dried, crispy filet( think beef jerky meets chicharron) and the tacos- very good!  As explained by our server, the corn is imported de Mexico and milled in house!

Angele C.,/user_details?userid=7z5N3W9p_S8-ZDhQPModrw,"BAYSIDE, NY",8/13/2022,4.0,"If you are looking for a quick go-to italian restaurant that is classy, this is the place to go. The ambiance is romantic, yet also a place you can go to with friends. They have classics like chicken and eggplant Parm but also a creative side to their menu like a giant truffle and stuffed cheese meatball. I enjoyed every bite of that appetizer meatball and would strongly suggest that everyone try it when you go! The drinks were made to perfection as I had a mango piña colada (different, right?). This is the type of place where you would go on a first date and it won't break the bank but it shows you have class (I saw a couple nearby on a date). They have outdoor and indoor seating and I like that their outdoor seating was on the side of their restaurant and not out in the street.

It took 30 min for us to even put our order in (and we had to call our server to actually put it in) and after that our food didn't come for 50 min! We were there for a total of two hours and no refills on a Diet Coke because nobody came around for us! I also hate to name drop the server but Yassine was absolutely awful and this is the second time I've come here and had issues with him! The first time he got into a full blown argument with my friend over a drink and that was around a month ago and I came back in hopes to not have him as a server and guess what! Just my luck. ADDITIONALLY, the table next to us had a horrible experience with him as well and actually complained to his face and the managers face! Now let me say this, the food is amazing. BUT I just don't think this can out weigh a server with an attitude and neglect. I came here to celebrate my birthday and once I realized we were somehow in his section i actually asked my gf to NOT tell anyone it was my birthday because I did not want him to sing.

It wasn't too hard to get a resi and I'm sure walks in would have also been fine. They gave some bread (which was very fluffy) with a red sauce. The sauce had a little bit of a red pepper flavor and was slightly sweet, but a delicious pairing with the bread. We got the Burrata Cheese as an appetizer to share which was also great. Then I got the fettuccine Verdi tartufate and my friend got a special they had which was called the mezzi rigatoni. She loved her dish and I also enjoyed mine- it was a little heavy on the cream which I had been warned about. The ambience inside was nice and the servers were very attentive.

Zack B.,/user_details?userid=KBkmW_bPnHCFb2DMRbpwOg,"Washington, DC",10/4/2021,5.0,"Came to La Nonna with some family after nearby SeaWolf was closed for a wedding. I am SO GLAD we found this place. They had a reservation available online, and we arrived about 5 minutes early. The hostess got us seated, and we loved the outdoor patio. We started with some cocktails and a bottle of rose, which was a great way to ease into the meal. As far as appetizers, I ordered the burrata cheese for the table, which came with the burrata, roasted tomatoes, gaeta olives, and balsamic pearls with some bread. Very good stuff. My entree was the tortelloni al Pollo which tasted fresh and came with very tender chicken. Sometimes cream-based pastas can feel like an adult mac and cheese, but I can promise you this one many many cuts above. Service was a bit slow at first but it leveled out. They were busy and there is a labor shortage, so I won't subtract any stars for that.

I knew I'd fill up on the complimentary bread as I was eating it (I added olive oil to it, it was delish). By the time my ENORMOUS pizza came I could only eat one slice! The rest was taken home and enjoyed the next day. Blood orange marg was very very very good. I had two! My husband said the filet was 5/5. I'm giving a solid 5 stars for the service. My husband had a coke in a glass and when he picked up the glass the bottom of the glass fell off (like, it just fell off, he didn't bump it or anything lol honestly kind of funny) and Coke went all over the table. So many waiters came over to help clean it up immediately and replace the drink. Really appreciated their service! Super friendly too. Bathroom was clean (but stall is teensy tiny).

The pasta was way undercooked and the seafood tasted stale and over cooked. It literally tasted like they cooked the seafood days ago then popped it in the microwave and left it in for too long. It just tasted like literal rubber. This place clearly doesn't care about the quality of their food. I'm not super picky but it's clear that they put ZERO effort into this food.

Jen Z.,/user_details?userid=q5a4xKVlev6HmAFUvG3rDw,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10/29/2021,2.0,"I usually never write Yelp reviews but was very frustrated by this experience. We spent about 1000 dollars at La Nonna. The food itself was good but not sure if it was good value in terms of portions for the appetizers. What was upsetting was there was a lot of different tricks to upcharge us despite us already spending a lot of money per person. For example, they ask do you want still or sparkling water? We said still and they added on a $9 bottle of still water when usually you would just assume there would be free tap water. In addition, 20% tip was already pre-added to the bill and they did not mention this. So we ended up tipping an extra 18% on top of the original bill. Overall almost 400 dollars of tips for what should have been a 600 dollar meal. What's insane is that they failed to mention how we overlooked this. Was a good meal if you are super on your toes about not being upcharged, but really left a bad taste in our mouths based on sneaky practices.

Clare C.,/user_details?userid=iX1viPe_vDTsfYoy-wkoOw,"Bronx, NY",7/1/2019,4.0,Food is delicious here. It is a little expensive but was worth it for a special celebration. Baked clams appetizer was delicious although I was a little disappointed that the clams were so small - about the size of a quarter. Entrees ordered by us averaged $25 and appetizers were half that. Sangria was nicely flavored and welcomed on a very hot day. Service was attentive and bread was warm and refilled.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Appetizers were fried calamari and a Mozzarella $ Pruiscutto special (fried) both apps were good, not great, but fresh, the calamari only had rings, which normally isn't the case in higher end restaurants, but either way it tasted fresh and wasn't chewy. A few of us ordered the pasta pescatore, was nicely flavored, the tomato sauce was a nice compliment to the seafood, but not a lot of seafood, was expecting more for price. My colleague ordered a risotto with salmon and didn't enjoy it much, the salmon was cut into scallop size pieces, very weird?? All in all a decent meal, but not great.

The presentation of all of the food was beautiful, and the flavors of each dish were like little explosions of heaven on your taste buds.  The wait staff was attentive and appropriately engaging and the meal from appetizer and drinks to dessert and coffee was well paced and the three of us were comfortably ready to leave in 90 minutes feeling extremely satisfied with our first ever Easter dinner in a restaurant.  While we didn't sit inside, it was a beautiful setting and clearly set up for social distancing.   As an Italian-American myself, I can tell you that this is a must go to Italian restaurant.  It took the traditional cuisine to the next level and we will most definitely be back there to dine again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great atmosphere, great food and lovely staff.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Their specials are beyond amazing and I highly recommend ordering one if it's your first time here. Also, their wine menu is amazing.

The reason for my two rating is because when my chicken parm order came out, there was a hair on my plate right next to the food. When I pointed out the hair to the server, the first thing that was asked was if I wanted another plate?!?! Seriously? I found that to be a very odd question since it was a hair that definitely wasn't my hair since I just got the food. Then when the server brought it to the waiter's attention, the waiter stopped by and said it looked like an eyelash (gross!). Of course, I asked for a brand new plate, which took a few minutes longer to get. However when the new dish came, the penne wasn't warm enough. I honestly wasn't impressed with the level of service nor the fact that I wasn't offered anything else to offset the inconvenience or the hair near the food either.

We went here because of all of the great feedback we get from friends around the neighborhood. Unfortunately, they didn't prep the table, we didn't have any flatware or proper dinnerware at the table, the staff was sub par, and our server decided to leave half way through service without a word. The drinks were great but my food was ok at best. I lived in Rome for a while so I feel that I know how Italian food should be. That being said, a plate of green fettuccini soaked in truffle oil has never been something I had overseas. It was advertised as a wild mushroom fettuccini but it was really over cooked pasta in a fake truffle sauce. Mushrooms were barely recognizable.

I've been craving Italian food as this time last year I was living in Milan and had authentic Italian food at my fingertips daily.We passed La Nonna on the way home and it looked authentic enough so we decide to give it a chance. Perhaps dinner is better in the restaurant but I can't imagine it makes a world of a difference. He ordered the Calamari Marinara with Spaghetti and I ordered Pasta Marinara. While the food was ok.. it was just ok, hardly worth the $21 for the Calamari Marinara and the $14 for penne with marinara. Not to mention the 6- 2inch pieces of bread thrown into the paperbag with the containers of food. We were only able to eat half as the rest was hard as rocks. All and all I'd rather pay a lot of money for a little food that tastes amazing rather than a lot of food that is ok.

He brings it back with the screen cracked. The screen was not cracked when I gave it to him. He tries to play it off at first, ""oh it just slipped"" but then comes clean. He says he'll get the manager out. So she comes out. And starts making excuses ""this is why you should've gone inside with him- we can't be responsible for this"" You've got to be fucking kidding me. No apologies, immediately with excuses. That is the definition of TERRIBLE customer service. I get it- accidents can happen. The waiter was rushed and the phone slipped out of his hand. I can live with it.

Alex S.,/user_details?userid=9GVY9Nnc9La8r5s1xZQnmQ,"Jackson Heights, NY",7/17/2020,2.0,"Called in for a reservation for two at 6:30 and was escorted by the kind hostess to our table. The food was great but the service was terrible. I understand due to the circumstances of the pandemic, staff may be short and waiting times for drinks, appetizers, and entrees may be a bit longer than usual. However, as the party sat down it would've been nice to have been at least offered water or having been asked for a drink order within the first five to eight minutes. Nonetheless, our waiter could've easily introduced himself and let us know we would have to wait a bit for his service. Still, more than 15 minutes have passed by and we're sitting dry at the table. Finally our waiter, or I thought, comes to offer water and doesn't offer any drinks. You would think a four star restaurant may want to up sell their best wine or offer their unique cocktails but none of that was recommended. My brother & I ordered a bottle of moscato which took longer than I hoped for. Soon we ordered our entrees, that came within reasonable time and it was well worth the wait. My brother ordered the chicken Parmesan with penne and I order the chicken Frances with linguine. Phenomenal food and even better serving portions. Thank you Chef! My brother midway through his first glass didn't like the wine which was noticed by our second waiter (our waiters switched) and recommended a better wine suited for his pallet. After finishing entrees and the wine we were hoping for dessert but wasn't offered any so we decided to go somewhere else. The food and wine spoke for themselves and lived up to the expectation. The service however, had a lot of room to improve on. My brother & I happened to think it was maybe the way were dressed that had something to do with our treatment? Granted, compared to everyone else we were a bit more casual but the service shouldn't change based off these judgements. I've been a waiter before at two well established restaurants and walk in with expectations depending on the restaurant of choice so this experience was disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Prudence C.,/user_details?userid=8DwuciFlGWYiOXBawq0hIA,"Manhattan, NY",11/4/2019,1.0,"We had a reeeally bad experience at La Nonna from beginning to end. I made a 7:30pm reservation for 11 people 6 weeks in advance to celebrate my mom & dad's birthdays with family flying in from out of town. When we arrived we were told the table for us wasn't ready as the party seated there was taking longer than expected. We had to stand there for 30 mins, with 4 very hungry young children, waiting for a different set of tables to be ready for us and were seated about 8pm. Strike 1. I immediately ordered 2 pizzas so we could get some food in the kids asap and those came quite quickly thank god, because we then had to wait for at least 30 mins for the 4 PASTA dishes we ordered to come...it was ridiculous.  No cheese was offered for the pastas, or drink orders retaken. Food was mediocre.  I had called in advance to give a heads up that we would be celebrating two birthdays and that we'd want celebration desserts to come out. Towards the end of the pasta course I sought out someone on the waitstaff to tell them the specific desserts to come out with sparklers in them, and at the same time we asked for the check. The kids were fading fast and we were dying to get out of there.  Then ensued another long wait, where major regret set in about doing a dessert course at all there! The two desserts finally came after my husband had a firm word with our waiter, but then we still had another long wait for the check. Strike 5? I've lost count.  Unfortunately for us gratuity was already included on the check, so we couldn't even tip appropriately for the crap experience.  I guess with a large gratuity guaranteed, there wasn't the incentive to provide good service.  I live across the street, but despite the convenience and the fact that Italian is our favorite food, we will absolutely NEVER dine at La Nonna again. I was embarrassed that I had selected this restaurant for such a big celebration with my whole family that happens only once or twice a year.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They are fried ravioli  filled with filet mignon, mushrooms and covered in a truffle cream sauce - delicious!! I had the Pollo Maltese. The dish was rich and tasty. My husband had the Ravioli All'Aragosta and it was fantastic!  The other dishes were specials and everyone ate every bite.

We know that our relatives and friends will absolutely enjoy the food as much as we did.  We ordered the octoput, eggplant tower, gnocchi, lobster ravioli and steak dishes. For dessert we had the pistachio brulee and tiramisu.   All of them were exceptional and delicious  Afterwards, we took a walk by the water and enjoyed the spectacular view of Manhattan.  All in all, we highly recommend La Nonna if you are going out for a casual dinner or if you want to invite those relatives from Italy out to eat, this is the spot.  They will be very impressed and you will be very glad you took them there!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Amazing decor, modern feel with a rustic twist, it has a very comfortable and cozy vibe. Can't go wrong with owners who grew up in Williamsburg, you know you'll be getting quality Italian along with great hospitality. Always a friendly vibe. Keep in mind portions are smaller because you're dining at a higher quality. Great wine selection, I know because I've been in the wine room. Also great for big parties of friends and family. There are 3 different kinds of Italian: 1. Fast Quick Italian dishes 2. Hearty full sized Italian dishes 3. High End Italian dishes, this earns the High End Italian.

Sasha A.,/user_details?userid=7uSUFuSz6ilxcURllgkzyg,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",11/12/2017,5.0,"I had the privilege of randomly walking into la nonna restaurant last Saturday night for dinner. I was walking along Kent ave taking in the smells of restaurants as I passed and la nona definitely lured me in. The restaurant was pretty busy so I opted to sit at the bar as I was by myself.  The bartender was very friendly and attentive and answered all my questions about the menu as I wasn't sure what to order.  The cocktail menu had a lot of tasty looking combinations on there but I ordered a virgin bloody Mary instead, virgin because I'm pregnant . Any other time I would've definitely tried one of their appealing cocktails.  The bloody Mary was very delicious btw! Spicy just how I like it and just a perfect balance of horseradish as I love the crunch it had. Practically a meal in a glass.  For dinner I ordered the salmon with veggies, don't remember the exact mane of the dish as there are a few salmon entrees on the menu. All I know is this was the best tasting salmon I've ever eaten! Seasoned to perfection, cooked amazingly juicy and succulent with the perfect crisp on top. With each bite, I ate slower to fully enjoy all the flavor of the salmon. The dinner also came with a home made bread basket with a to die for red sauce that you dip the bread into. Now I'm not a big bread eater but I finished every last piece of bread in the basket that night.  A couple was sitting at the bar with me and noticed I was kind of dancing in my chair as I ate. They asked me how I liked the food and of course I proceeded to rave about it. It turns out they were actually the owners of la nona, I think their names were Ana and Connor.  I was glad to have met them to let them know how much I was enjoying their establishment. Overall a very wonderful experience at this restaurant, I would highly recommend it to anyone.

This is coming from someone who just spent a week in Italy eating authentic Italian food. This was better. The restaurant set up is beautiful, our table ordered four appetizers, all of them delicious, and my main dish, superb! My favorite appetizer was the eggplant.

Meg C.,/user_details?userid=Rk1ugcgz5AOkEVy_ZjJBYA,"North Massapequa, NY",3/30/2014,5.0,After having a bad experience at the Bedford Ave location I was hesitant on this place. I'm glad I went though because the food and service were awesome. We started with the Frittelle Di Burrata which was a little difficult to cut into and portion out but tasted delicious. For my main course I went with the Raviolo All'Uovo. I was a little worried about the egg but it worked well.

We enjoyed some incredible appetizers that where accommodated in a family-style manner and following that I had one of the best Italian dishes.

Jackie S.,/user_details?userid=TF9LPBLQOEmo0SLbqM72sA,"Manhattan, NY",4/29/2016,1.0,I am very confused by other reviews here. We went with my jetlagged in-laws for the first time and ordered a few pizzas to quickly share and I don't think I have ever tasted anything as grotesque or similar to celeste or elios microwaveable pizza since I graduated college over a decade ago. It honestly tasted like someone took rubbery pita bread and put some toppings over it then tried to heat it up. Disgusting. I tried to joke/complain a little to the waiter about it and he ignored me as he was clearly aware of the problem and just could not deal. Worst pizza I've ever had served to me including in airports.

Sabrina S.,/user_details?userid=_Ye99j6n8P8rjO6ucD_evQ,"Brooklyn, NY",12/24/2014,1.0,"Now, I was a HUGE fan of La Nonna when they were on Bedford ave, they made the most delicious pasta dishes ever, absolutely anything you ordered on the menu was fantastic so, for Christmas Eve this year I thought why not try out the new one on Kent... Now I know why everyone should not try it. First, I ordered seafood salad as an appetizer. On the menu it said it had crab, shrimp, calamari and one or two other seafoods I forget, I think one was a mussel and a type of fish. When I got the dish, it was flat out huge chunks of imitation crab and shrimp smaller than your fried rice from the chinese take out spot. The dish was $17. When I complained to the waitress about the crab being imitation she said ""well, we know its imitation but we wouldn't put imitation on the menu because no one would order it then"" I was completely in shock that a waitress would basically say well we know the quality of food we are serving you is horrible and if we were honest about it on the menu no one would ever eat here. I was completely horrified at this point, I almost cried because La Nonna on Bedford was seriously my favorite spot ever and like much of the Williamsburg we all loved 4 years ago, it is now dead. I thought to myself okay well at least I ordered raviolis for an entree and La Nonna always made good home made pasta... WRONG I forgot I had ordered their Christmas Eve special of ""Blue Crab Raviolis with Asparagus in a cognac creme sauce"" What I got looked exactly like and tasted like the seafood raviolis from Trader Joe's... they barely even had crab in them, they actually were filled half with shrimp which was never once mentioned on the menu which is really scary of a restaurant to do when so many people are allergic to shrimp... and of course imitation crab and the best part, they only gave 4 raviolis! 4 SMALL SQUARE RAVIOLIS for $22! At this point, I told the waitress they tasted like Trader Joe's raviolis, the owner of the restaurant came out and instead of apologizing for the insane flip of quality on her food she starts putting the blame on me and arguing with me that ""the only thing she admits is she put imitation crab in everything and at least the shrimp was real in the salad"" The creme sauce never saw cognac, it also tasted like it was from a jar with no flavor and when I mentioned that there was shrimp in the raviolis the waitress started arguing with me, telling me that it probably was ""dungeness crab"" which I am not an idiot, I know what that is and dungeness crab has the exact same texture of any other crab meat, it is not a small pink spiral that tastes like shrimp. It really pissed me off that they kept trying to fool me like I didn't know what real food or any seafood is supposed to taste like. They only shredded one piece of asparagus on the ravioli plate and everyone else's dishes at my table were absolutely pathetic. If you want to spend a ton of money to sit in a pretty spot, have the rudest waitresses and owner who could give a crap about what they put in anyones mouth and get sick, go here, if not, you're better off at the other 200 Italian restaurants in the area.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-nonna-ristorante-and-bar-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

For the entree I ordered the sacchetti. The waiter did warn me that it would be spicy but I thought I could handle it. My mistake. It tasted really good but I just wish it were less spicy. That little hiccup didn't even bring down a star though because I was still so content with my appetizers. Also the waitstaff was super.

Joe Joe B.,/user_details?userid=KaQXmoL9fhITB4LEeorN5g,"Brooklyn, NY",6/24/2022,4.0,This hip prospect heights eatery has been getting great notices for years. Much of it truly deserved. The location is small and hosts a nice bar which you can eat at and watch the cooks work. Limited table seating is tight and reservations are highly recommended. The drink menu is great and the wine selection is lovely. The menu is seasonal and changes every so often. It's limited but it's focus is great. I was actually amazed the chefs are able to make this menu in such a small kitchen. The lobster crackers are a must. The som was nice as well. Crudo is tasty and light. I did find the pork dish over cooked but tasty. Staff is friendly and attentive.

Really, one of those ""only in Brooklyn"" restaurants where you feel completely taken out of the city. Reservations here are pretty hard to come by, and I recommend looking for reservations at least 2 weeks in advance. We enjoyed sitting in the back patio area, and it seems that they can still accommodate walk ins but without real tables. The soft shell crab here was so good (although cost a pretty penny), as were the asparagus fries. Our gin cocktail was good and did not taste strong.

Kale and crab rangoon was $13 now $18. None of the plates 2 years ago even got close to hitting 30 dollars they were all 20-25. The spatzle dishes used to 15 now its 20. Carrot crepe was 13 now its 20. The frozen yogurt used to be 9 dollars now its 13. Covid inflation is real and very present in this restaurant because they choose to raise the prices to compensate but that's not great for the community.

I could not drink it and sent it back. We thought that Watermelon Sushi was terrible, all you tasted was bonito flakes. It was a waste of good fish. We liked the carrot crepe. The crab rangoons were under seasoned, and it was just poor presentation that the dumplings did not fit in the bowl for the sauce. We got the smoked duck - which was way to smokey - the duck was tender, and that was good - but you tasted only smoke. It was a waste of a good piece of duck. The scallops were prepared well, BUT - that corn/blueberry sauce was not good. We also had to wait 20 minutes for the scallops.

Our server was very nice but extremely soft spoken (the restaurant is NOT QUIET) so we had to have her repeat things again and again. And the dietary restriction thing got a little...forced. Both of us have some - not allergies, more like strong preferences - and we told the server we could figure it out. She kept questioning us - are you vegetarian? Pescatarian?

Jason B.,/user_details?userid=Np2g1tfcUlk-7Q-s217e0A,"Cranbury, NJ",10/15/2022,2.0,"This place is extremely average for the price. I was with a group of 4 and the waitress actually recommended we order the entire menu because of the portions if we were hungry or 9 dishes if we weren't that hungry! Seriously!? We started off ordering cocktails and my mezcal cocktail was good, but nothing special. We first had the duck mousse that was actually pretty decent and the crudo was decent as well, but not memorable. The brussel sprouts were basically a bowl of burnt brussel sprouts leaves with truffle shavings on top, very boring. The roasted butternut squash was a joke for $30. This was probably the worst dish I have every ordered for over $30, EVER. I could honestly make a better butternut squash dish at home. The scallops were another joke. Two tiny scallops on sticks with some lettuce with for $34?! Everything is so outrageously overpriced it is comical how people would even come here when there are so many better options in the neighborhood for that type of money.

The squash onion rings were great but I really wish there were more of them.. 4 small rings for $15 felt a bit ridiculous. The banana squash bread and the root vegetable som tum were blah. We also got the crab and kale rangoon, which kind of just tasted like spinach and artichoke dip.. no crab in them. The lobster spatzle and the roasted and confit duck were delicious and definitely the standouts. The arctic char was also pretty good.

This time we got to dine in the back garden (it's closed last time due to rain). The cocktails (lavender, rosemary and rhubarb) set us in the mood. Knowing that the portions tended to be small, we ordered all the snacks and plates (except the liver mousse eclairs) on the menu including double orders of corn bread and Crab Rangoon for six of us. The delicious corn bread with honey truffle butter was a crowd pleaser. The crab Rangoon served in a Chinese takeout container was tasty. We barely got a morsel of dainty carrot crepe and minuscule clams. Tiny samples of the other snacks/plates including yellow wax beans, spaetzle, squash som tum, and lobster crackers that came in quick succession, found nothing spectacular. Then there was a long interlude before the mains arrived  Of the entrees the roasted duck confit was superb: tender, juicy and flavorful. The scallops tasted very fresh. The tomato schnitzel would have been great if the crust/tomato could be crispier. The froyo dessert and shortcake were satisfactory. Our dinner spanned 2 1/2 hours.

The guinea hen was a slight disappointment given how salty it was, but the confit was still a win. Drinks have low ABV but are mostly enjoyable.

The menu is broken up into starters, small plates, and slightly larger plates. Our server recommended 3 dishes per person and the whole menu was 14 dishes I think, so we agreed on 5 things we didn't want and ordered the rest of the menu and shared. We really liked everything although some dishes really stood out - the pork belly was so good we got seconds!

Yoav E.,/user_details?userid=sKjukADxw5Hh2iN0spgvrA,"Brooklyn, NY",11/27/2020,3.0,"Had their Thanksgiving prefix last night at the outdoor back area, decor was beautiful but even though it was relatively warm for the season we still found it chilly, the closed section of the back area does not have any heaters on it so dining here when it gets colder is definitely out of the question. Service was fine, food was generally good (but to be honest my favorite course was the bread and butter), wine pairings were underwhelming but cocktails were good for the price. Lavender yogurt dessert was exceptional. They lose one star for sneaking in a Covid fee that they didn't tell us about in advance even though they had plenty of opportunities to (multiple confirmation e-mails, etc). I'm all for contributing and encouraging restaurants to stay in business, but adding a 10% charge at the last minute felt very shady. The meal was expensive enough, if you want to raise prices just raise prices.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/olmsted-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The dishes are delicious and interesting and, while on the smaller size, it always leaves me wanting to come back for more. One of my favorite things on the menu is actually the yogurt dessert. Really light and beautiful; a perfect way to end a meal. I also really appreciate the casual, but sophisticated decor of the place.

Jori Rose S.,/user_details?userid=0RuOMmuwtRB8jJwFHdUq5g,"New York, NY",5/3/2018,5.0,"Olmsted is where the hype lives up to your expectations. I've been twice now, for dinner and brunch. While you sometimes have to book a month out for a reservation, it's totally worth the wait. The actual restaurant is not huge, but the tables are spaced out well enough for it not to feel cramped. Brunch really knocked it out of the park. My boyfriend and I got 4 plates to share and it was more than enough food. We shared the Egg Rolls, Potato Latke, Spanakopita Shakshuka, and the Krapfen Rhubarb Donuts. The Egg Rolls were filled with housemade bacon, farm eggs and vermont cheddar--a combination inside an egg roll I never knew could taste so perfect. The Potato Latke was cooked to perfection and topped with lemon creme fraiche and smoked trout rod. Insane. So good. Honestly, everything we ate was insanely delicious. Whats so impressive is not only the inventiveness of the menu but the actual execution of it. The ONLY thing that I found to be a bit annoying was that a cup of coffee (which in my opinion tasted like diner coffee was $5 for a single cup which is a biiiiit much for the lackluster taste).",https://www.yelp.com/biz/olmsted-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Jimmy M.,/user_details?userid=CJvPWtO9khT58MoBjonvtw,"Louisville, KY",3/2/2020,5.0,"Olmsted is the MVP of restaurants in New York. Chef Baxtrom, who trained under two of the most highly regarded names in the business, serves up some of the most flavorful, creative food I've ever enjoyed, regardless of price point. But his ability to do this without having a single item on the menu above 24 dollars is simply remarkable. Furthermore, the lack of high priced options and pretentiousness makes Olmsted extremely comfortable for a relaxed meal any day of the week. Three of their dishes from my most recent experience at Olmsted stand out: delicious squash rings served on an actual tree - of sorts; extremely basic crab rangoon, with a very simply but equisite spin, served humbly, and for fun in a Chinese take-out container no less; and the most delicious duck dish - served two ways, both incredible - that I've ever encountered in my life. Beyond this, the service is superb, stacked with serious foodies who will happily offer their honest opinions. The drink menu is outstanding, with simply labeled cocktails disguising brilliant subtlety. And the atmosphere is as good as it gets, feeling like you're eating in the chef's garden; and that's before you go out into the actual back garden of the restaurant, where you can roast smores, keeping warm under blankets on a cold winter's night. Olmsted is simply amazing, and easily one of my 3 favorite restaurants in the world.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/olmsted-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We came here at 5pm (opening) hoping to get a table or at the very least a seat at the bar. No such luck! So we decided to have a drink and eat snacks in their garden where they grow herbs that they use in their dishes, so that's pretty cool. They also have  2-3 birds in a birdhouse. Nice and plump birds but we dont think they are meant for meals. LOL.  There are heating lamps and blankets on the benches so you wont get cold in the garden.  For cocktails we had the Matcha and Lavender - both excellent. The waiter warned us the Matcha was among sweetest drinks on the menu but we didn't think it was sweet. Snacks:  crawfish boil crackers - good but thought they could have given more knowing how inexpensive a bag of these are in Asian stores and then just sprinkle cajun/creole spices on then; golbi  cauliflower - excellent; duck mousse - excellent.  We put out names on the wait list for cancellations and we were lucky someone cancelled and we got a seat at the bar around 6pm. We started with the kale crab rangoon. Its nothing like the rangoon in your typical Chinese restaurant. Perfectly crispy on the outside and inside had this delicate tasting crab mix.  This was served in a Chinese takeout box which we thought was very whimsical.  We then had the carrot crepe. Wasn't sure what to expect but it was one of the best and most inventive things we ate there.  For mains we had the duck and rutabaga.  The duck comes in two parts and they recommend you eat them together. We agree!  The rutabaga was the best thing we had.  Incredible rich sauce but without the heaviness from eating it with your typical pasta.  Just incredible.  The service is excellent here.  We can't wait to come back!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/olmsted-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Great value for money but the service was a little slow and scattered in our experience. The food was stellar and the space had a very cute ambience. Will definitely come back to this place in the summer again since they have an outdoor garden we haven't experienced.

The waitress was nice but quiet, timing of service on and off fast and slow but the menu is SO unique and so delicious and actually filling. Every plate that came was better than the last.

Alex R.,/user_details?userid=LZqs5FKXUhEX5B4QccOqIQ,"Brooklyn, NY",12/22/2019,2.0,"I had been wanting to dine at Olmsted for two years and was so excited when I finally made the reservation. Sadly, my guests and I left disappointed, underwhelmed and hungry. The ambiance and service are nice. The creativity and concept are there. However, the execution, food, and flavor are completely underwhelming. I truly wanted to love each dish and when disappointed with the first, brushed it off and said the next will be better. I found myself at the end of the meal with no silver lining, a lingering appetite, and a $200 bill. We shared seven dishes for three people. The lobster starter was a centimeter of liquid and two centimeters of foam in a small cup with airy, crispy chips. The lobster flavor was indiscriminate. The squash were good enough but really only five slices of delicata squash. The beef tartare completely lacked flavor and textures did not come together well. The pierogis were good but not memorable, and just as good as any fried dumpling. The carrot crepe was probably the most disappointing. It was delicate and pretentious- almost insulting to call it a crepe. Again, we are open to creativity and invention but the flavor must be there and it just wasn't. We actually are light eaters, and did not go in expecting hearty steaks. We did expect flavor and being fed well though. After five small (very small) beginning plates, I still had hope for the two entrees. The scallops were inconsistently cooked- two soft without searing and three burnt/blackened (a burnt flavor not a delicious scallop sear). The rutabaga tagliatelle was okay but again needed much more flavor! I really wanted something to wow me, or at least hit the mark! I wanted to feel good about spending $200 and sadly couldn't justify it. I want to note that the service was good, ambiance nice, and cocktails great. However, I just can't understand how Olmsted is so highly recommended and rated for the food. Maybe it is because of our Instagram era and the slight whimsy and gimmick of it all, but even that isn't pushed forward enough at Olmsted to make this dinner memorable. Although still hungry and craving a win from Olmsted, we lost hope by the end to opt for dessert and left to go get dessert elsewhere. Ah well.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/olmsted-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

First of all, the staff is so incredibly cordial that you almost can't believe people can genuinely be that nice! We had an early reservation on a Friday night and when we showed up on time we noticed how cute the back garden was.  We asked the host if we could possibly have a drink outside first. I prepared myself for the old ""well we need your table back at such and such time, blah, blah,blah"" and what I got was "" of course! We also think it's special to have dessert out there"" Now reservations at this place are almost impossible to come by but I never once got the feeling that they were rushing us out in any way. The cocktail list is amazing. I had the the Rosemary to start, mezcal, aperol, chipotle, lemon and black lava salt and it was perfect. We ordered the charcuterie pretzel puffs to munch on and I could have eaten about 10 more. The waiter outside was so genuinely warm that I just was all fuzzy and relaxed, again,  the service here is impeccable. When we did meander back inside we had a table up front by the window. This place is very small inside and it was packed but I never felt cramped. This is what we had for dinner. The carrot crepe with clams and sunflower. I would never order this combination if I hadn't read how good it is and all I can say is, order it. It was heavenly!!! Next dry rub scallops with corn and chanterelles. Another winner. The scallops are served in the corn husks and the corn on a separate plate. Luckily the corn plate was in front of me and I came awfully close to picking it up and licking the remaining bits. English pea falafel was next and although it was served with some very interesting accoutrements, it was probably my least favorite. The whipped peas and cardamom labneh it was served with were excellent I just found the falafel a touch dry. We decided to take our dessert, see inventive cocktail list, back outside to finish the night with the tarragon which was amazingly refreshing. The wine list is short and sweet with most bottles under $50, exactly how it should be. I already tried to make another reservation to revisit but alas, nothing available. I will hit open table on a daily basis until I find an opening, Olmsted is that good.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/olmsted-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Alex S.,/user_details?userid=gprnL5qRbxBUDpm9pLgc-A,"Atlanta, GA",5/15/2018,2.0,"I was visiting NYC for the weekend and looking for someplace new to try, I happened upon Olmsted, after seeing it listed by a number of publications as a ""must try"" place. It was far from it. It wasn't all bad, but it  just wasn't that impressive, and the hype is confounding. First, the good: great cocktails (a little pricey, but nothing outrageous by NYC-Brooklyn standards). I tried three different cocktails - two off the the menu and one which was the bartender's creation - and they were all outstanding. A rare meal where I thought the drinks were the best part. The space is also quite lovely. It does feel like a classic ""date night"" spot. Second, the mediocre: the food - really underwhelming with the exception of the crawfish boil crackers. Aside from the crackers, I had the gobi pakora cauliflower, carrot crepe, and grilled scallops. The cauliflower tasted like the last remnants of something you might scrap up from an Indian lunch buffet that was about to close. The carrot crepe was tasteless, and the grilled scallops meh. Even though I hadn't really enjoyed the meal, I hoped that dessert - a lavender honey frozen yogurt would soothe some of my disappointment. It didn't. It wasn't really bad. But it wasn't really good either. This is a relatively expensive place to eat, and it is difficult to justify the cost of this meal. I am sure the ingredients were all of the highest quality (and the care taken in preparing the various plates was obvious), but this just isn't very memorable.

I was so excited to take my mother here when she visited me in Brooklyn because I'd heard such great things about the restaurant. I had to make the reservation a month in advance at like 9:30 am and even at that time there were only several time slots left, possibly because there were going to be 3 of us and that's an odd number.  When we got there, the decor was simple and the food really was delicious. I especially enjoyed the crepe, which is one of their most-known dishes. That being said, the experience was not good.  First of all, we didn't have one set waiter, which definitely led to inconsistencies. The first person who spoke to us recommended 3 dishes per person. The second person who spoke to us suggested 6-8 dishes total (for a group of 3). We ended up getting 7 dishes. It was NOT enough, even after we all ordered desert. Also, we got the first 5 dishes in the first 1.5 hours of our meal, in slow succession. After that, we waited for over 45 minutes with no food and no one coming to get another drink order even when I tried to flag someone down. At one point I did order a drink from someone and they disappeared and I had to wait another good length of time to flag someone else down for another drink. Then our last two dishes came and we ate desert in the backyard. It was pretty, and there were wool blankets outside which was cute. I really wish this had been a good experience, but I will not be going back again. We literally left the restaurant and ordered a pizza because my mom and boyfriend were still hungry.

The carrot and clam crepe sounds really weird, I was surprised how amazing it tasted - favorite of the night. Roasted Hen was nice size portion served in 2 parts with stuffed breast meat and a bowl of dark meat confit with mushrooms.  Only miss were the scallops which were described as having a dry rub - just a spicy blackened rub that completely overpowered the scallops. (But the corn polenta a green garlic served with it made the dish worth getting.) Bonus is Ample Hills Creamery is right down the block!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/olmsted-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Monica S.,/user_details?userid=HKf3MmBheAiszkAtSUIcXg,"Los Angeles, CA",4/7/2023,4.0,After walking across the Brooklyn bridge this is a great market to get some food and rest. There are a bunch of different food stands so no need for you to argue with your group on what to eat l. I got the Nashville chicken and my friend got some ramen. The food was great and there is also dessert options too. They have two ground bars and a rooftop one. The rooftop one did have bad service. The bartenders were all on one side ignoring the customers on the other side. The views of the Brooklyn bridge are stunning here.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Shirley C.,/user_details?userid=Srv9jOGELiNGIJEqhS5_uQ,"Toronto, Canada",2/20/2023,4.0,"The Timeout Market is in DUMBO under tbe Brooklyn Bridge bridge area. It's a really nice concept with an indoor group of restaurants and easy seat yourself areas. There is a good selection of cuisines eg. Japanese ramen, Indian cuisine, Thai and American. We tried the dishes from a number of places and everything tasted great. Loved the Thai food we had a shrimp appetizer and pad Thai, at the Indian place chicken roti and samosas, mango lassi and Japanese ramen. Ordering was easy you pay and get a buzzer while you wait for your food. It does get quite busy and it's hard to get an indoor table.

They gave our samples online and that is how I was convinced to try the brisket. It was full of flavor and super tender. And I had to get the chicharones because... I mean just look at them. The were so crunchy without being chewy and they were delicious. The bbq sauce and the mustard were also amazing.

I would compare this to a much smaller version of Chelsea market with more seating options. Communal seating is setup throughout the market and on a nice day the rooftop would be the perfect spot to hang out. I dined at Fornino Pizza and ordered the Calabrese Pizza. Pizza was tasty and made with fresh ingredients! Would love to go back and try more restaurants. Honestly one could spend breakfast until dinner here. Highly recommend checking this place out.

Ingrid S.,/user_details?userid=vXAUaZSn7reLfjLk73MeeA,"Brooklyn, NY",12/5/2022,4.0,"There are things I like and hate about the market. It's overcrowded beyond belief. Or at least when I came in this past Saturday afternoon. But there also was a holiday market going on as well as the World Cup so maybe that had some factor. Everything is a little bit over-priced. It's hard to figure out what you're getting the most bang for your buck but I guess if you circle enough times you'll find something worth indulging in. I didn't check out the roof top but I'm sure the views are worth it. It was pouring rain and I hastily ordered my food to dine in on china-ware so I figured out the hard way that you can't bring glass up to the roof when trying to meet my friend. Anyway, I ended up getting Jacob's Pickles' buffalo mac and cheese for $15 plus tax plus a heavily insistent that I tip, even though it's self serve. Oh well. I was torn between that and a ramen spot because that seemed like a hefty portion for $20-ish dollars and a great day for a huge bowl of it. But the portion size for the buffalo mac was hearty and huge. Enough so that I saved about half for today's lunch. My friend tried Bark Bbq that's brand new. I trust people with how delicious the bbq is but man are the portions small for how much you spend. She ended up getting 2 ribs, a piece of cornbread, and like 3 or 4 plantains for $21 or $22. Everything she said tasted great but maybe not the price tag. Ended our meal with Sugar Hill Creamery. They let us sample a few flavors before deciding. I went with the Harlem Sweeties which was a salted caramel ice cream with butterscotch and brownies and the other flavor I got was the peppermint bark ice cream cake. Man, both were great. They also serve your ice cream in a legitimate huge ass cone that doesn't cost extra. We will have none of those garbage tasting cones nonsense. Thank you. Giving Ample Hills a run for their money. It's convenient for having tons of options if you're with folks that don't want to eat at the same spot but seating is really hard to knab.

If you get take out you can even go up to the rooftop park (not bar) & eat with a view! Love that you have access all the well known restaurants in one place. Great for those visiting New York. For those from NY, the prices here in my opinion is too much & with limited options. For me I got three Al Pastor tacos with a lemonade from Ivy Stark Mexology & that came out to be $25. Travel down to Sunset Park on the N and you'll have more delicious authentic tacos for 1/4 the price. My husband got 2 small sliders also for $20 (no drinks, no sides). It was good, but not worth the price good. Otherwise, very trendy place.

While it's not the best spot for breakfast (only two vendors open early enough for breakfast), it's a great spot for later in the day. Tons of vendors: Clinton St. Baking Company, Little Neck Raw Bar, Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors, Fornino, Sugar Hill Creamery, Bubusan, Jacob's Pickles, and on and on... We got bagels from Ess-a-Bagel and took them outside. And that's really the highlight of Time Out Market - the view!!! There are lots of outside tables (and apparently a rooftop, although we didn't make it there) - and the view of the East River and the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges is fantastic.

When we got the receipt it said ""2 Combos"", 15$(?)each and extra 5 each for the Pina Coladas(?), ok whatever AGAIN. When we received our COMBOS WE DIDNT ORDER & our pina coladas. WE REALIZED HE GAVE IS THE WRONG FOOD! Went back up to the cashier & he just took food off another tray & put it on our tray-NO WORDS SPOKEN AGAIN(?) So then, we realized there was no alcohol in our drinks(?), so we went back up again to the cashier and asked if there was alcohol in our drinks, HE POINTED AGAIN AT THE CHALKBOARD(?!), no words again & with a nasty attitude(?)-IN SMALL PRINT ON THIS BUSY CHALKBOARD IT SAID ""we do not serve alcohol"", WOW!!!!!?

There's a lot of jewelry and clothing vendors. I tried Mr Taka Ramen and Clinton Street Bakery -- both were good. The Sugar Hill Creamery had really good ice cream (get the coffee ice cream!) .

I ordered spaghetti and butternut squash soup from the pasta vendor. Both were delicious and multiple people stopped to ask where I ordered the dishes.

Lianna T.,/user_details?userid=NtO49z_Rthb4uOdNrZTSew,"Austin, TX",7/6/2019,5.0,"When I heard about Time Out Market and the many food vendors they had recruited, I was excited to check it out first hand. The market does not disappoint. On the bottom floor some food vendors include Fish Cheeks selling delicious Thai food and fresh oysters, Bessou with their fried crispy rice topped with sashimi, Alta Calidad and their variety of tacos, among many others. The layout is appealing with plenty of tables to enjoy whichever food you choose. We split some tacos at Alta Calidad, but I had I gone to the rooftop first, I definitely would have gotten food there instead. The rooftop has beautiful views of the river, an impressive bar, and additional food vendors including Nur. However, it is clear Time Out has vetted all of these vendors, carefully choosing the best. All options seem good and it is a place that will require many return visits to try the many places.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Great location right next to the Brooklyn waterfront by Janes Carousel. Plenty of good food options from ramen to sushi, chicken and biscuits, sandwiches, oysters, and plenty more. All players seem to be around $8-$10 appetizers and $15-$30 entrees depending on which establishment you go to and where you order. The only downside is that indoor seating is very limited with a small counter at each stand and a dozen or so communal tables by the main entrance. There are  park benches and tables outside but because the food is served in actual plates that becomes a lot of weight to carry when you're trying to find a table and also not drop anything. The biggest issue however is drinks. Food vendors do not sell or serve drinks and that includes water and soda not to mention Alcoholic beverages. So in order to get a drink you now have to carry your food to one of the many bars and order it there. Seems like an unnecessary step. Also when you're done eating you have to bring your plates and utensils back inside otherwise it'll just pile up on the outdoor tables and no one will be about to sit.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Came on a Memorial Day and the hall was not as advertised. Only about 6 vendors open on the ground floor out of about 20 stalls, and the 6 were completely overwhelmed. Despite the empty stalls, the layout of the market makes for very tight spaces with very low ceilings, not the best when you are still in a pandemic, waiting 20 minutes in line to order and another 45 minutes to receive supposedly ""fast casual"" food. And the pricing is insane: $13 for a very mediocre Mac and cheese, $27 for a salad with shrimp. Much higher than the pricing for the same food at other locations (like jacobs pickles and Clinton st baking company). I'm guessing the vendors charge higher prices to cover higher rents, but none of that translates into a better experience for the customer.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

MT L.,/user_details?userid=DGMkum0hDYRNTz8HGz3BNw,"New York, NY",2/15/2020,4.0,"I very much enjoyed the crispy rice trio with salmon, spicy tuna, and yellowtail from Bessou at Time Out Market. However, the market and seating were spread between the first and fifth floors, the latter being less crowded but with more expensive food options (it also features a view, though partially blocked by a bandstand stage and a bar). The weekend crowd made carrying loaded trays difficult and also led to a scarcity of seating, especially for groups of three or more. I saw quite a few people hoarding spaces even before they obtained their food (maybe a seating host could assist during busy times?). Fortunately, the tables were bussed quickly and efficiently. The line for the restroom was also quite long -- surprising for the fact that the space had two bars and a coffee shop -- though they did have an attendant assisting there. The biggest disappointment was the water filling station; it was an ice water dispenser at the front bar with a sign stating ""Please do not fill your water bottle here. Glassware is provided next to the water station. Thank You!"" Unfortunately, next to the dispenser was a stack of small, PLASTIC cups (for the environmental and financial cost of the cups, installing a water fountain with a bottle dispenser might seem the better option here).

Gabriel U.,/user_details?userid=1hzqiZUivGQfkPFWEoT5Gw,"New York, NY",6/8/2019,2.0,"Not the best experience. The idea of it is cute, but once you get there, see all the dirty tables, all the lines, and all the people that idea goes away. We saw so many people having to clean their own tables and put the dirty dishes on other tables so that they could have a seat. There's no clear designation for dirty dishes/ trays when you're done with them so customers just end up leaving the table dirty, and there was no one cleaning them up so everything was just accumulated. Took us close to an hour to find a table (it was dirty) and close to another hour to get our food. We tried the Broccoli Gnocchi from Felice Pasta Bar and I would give that dish a 3/5. It was eh and I was still hungry after (my boyfriend couldn't finish the plate, said it was all mush). We then tried the Vegan Quesadilla from BKLYN WILD and that was a 2/5. We both couldn't finish it, it was cold when we got it despite picking it up as soon as the buzzer went off, and it was very bland. The star of the show for us was the Mac and Cheese from Jacob's Pickles. Easiest the best mac and cheese we've all had. 5/5. It was cooked perfectly, had the perfect amount of cheese, and the slightly crunchy layer on top was amazing. Apart from that, you do get a nice view of the river if you go towards the back/ the third floor, but that doesn't really outweigh the unkemptness, crowds, and eh food for me to go back when I'm in town.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The venue exceeded my expectations. Compared to other food halls in Manhattan and Brooklyn, there's a different vibe and servicescape after you explore all the various ground floor restaurants including the ones at the 5th floor rooftop. Since our kids wanted pizza, we stayed on the 5th floor where they have a Juliana's, a more scenic view,  indoor/outdoor rooftop seating, the TimeOut Bar and a live DJ playing some nostalgic hits. The beef burger from David Burke Tavern was also very good. For a while the 5th floor was less crowded compared to the hip trendy dark decor ground floor which has more restaurant selections but eventually we saw other guests bringing up their food in the elevator to dine in the more luminscent rooftop area. Cleaning staff also appeared to be on point.

Milo S.,/user_details?userid=hykYfWp8ZxAVpsdOHD3yZQ,"Brooklyn, NY",10/7/2019,1.0,"Disappointing experience at Little Ada market tonight. I ordered the salad nicoise and asked for no pita. I wasn't sure the person working the counter totally understood my order, so I clarified. A couple of times.  I paid and waited patiently for my order. What arrived looked suspiciously like hummus with some Israeli tabbouleh on top, and despite my specific request to the contrary, came with a large chunk of pita on the side. Reserving judgment so far. I dug in  hoping I would discover some fish inside there nestled among the...hummus. Which would be a strange combination, but I was in a hurry and decided to go with it. Turned out it was a generous order of hummus with Israeli tabbouleh, which was tasty, but definitely not what I ordered, despite my repeated clarifications. I was pressed for time, so I left. If you're open-minded, don't mind playing a wildcard for your meal, and into hummus, by all means, roll the dice with this place.

I'm actually not trying to review Time Out Market New York, which in itself, is a very unique food hall that has all the offerings you could ask for. I am actuall trying to review a certain restaraunt in Time Out Market New York called Little Ada, a hummus bar. It's a quaint little place in the market, with quite a variety of options. The staff behind the counter were very kind, and I ordered the Chicken Shwarma. That being said, the prices were EXTREMELY high, a big reason for why I did not give it as many stars as I would have liked. My shwarma cost $16, and despite the amount of food being a little more than a normal shwarma order, it was still not justifiable to be that much. Along with this, the wait time was fairly long, taking around 11 minutes to finish my order while other restaraunts in the market took significantly less time to prepare food. Ultimately, if the food hadn't been so expensive with the wait time being a bit shorter m, I would've definetely given it more stars, but in total, it is a solid restaurant that I do recommend to individuals visiting the market.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/time-out-market-new-york-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The place was really nice it reminded me of a upscale food court of a mall. I went to the rooftop to order two beers and female bartender with the glasses was only friendly with the white clientele around the bar. When i got to the bar me and my boyfriend were at the end of the bar next to the sign and she looked our way 5x and not even a hello from her. After 10 min of being ignored we came to the area she was in and still not even a smile or a hello its like me and my boy friend were not even there. I got upset cause three white girls came to the same spot i was in and she went up to them introduced herself and set napkins for them and took they order. We were finally helped after the bar was empty and her introduction was Not a hi but what do you want which was very rude to me. I ordered two Brooklyn Lager and left her no tip.

I got really frustrated, tried to go to the left, to the right, but I could not have one of them to take my order. 25 minutes later I called my wife and my friend and we all made gestures and called attention of the bar staff which finally talked to us with very annoyed facial expressions. They took our order, made the drinks very fast but they tasted terrible - overly sweetened and very alcoholic. I was so frustrated after that trying to find a reason that I couldn't go back and ask them why they did what they did. Could that be because we're South-Americans and were speaking Portuguese between ourselves? I clearly cannot see the motivation behind this weird and disgusting behavior.

The bartenders were VERY rude and insulting. I accidentally mispronounced the drink name and the bartender pointed it out to us in a very nasty way. We also had another question about a drink and the bartenders respond was ""Wow I guess you guys really can't read"". Your job is to know some information about the drinks you are serving! We were buying bottles and the bartender handed us glasses that were dirty and still had lipstick marks on them from previous customers. Don't you know you should wipe off glasses to get rid of extra marks? When we asked them for different glasses the bartender pretended to put our glasses back but still gave us the same glasses with an even bigger attitude. I thought maybe this bartender was having a bad day since the service we received from this person was terrible but when we went back to get some more drinks another bartender treated us just as terrible. If you have the patience to put up with rude, nasty, insulting bartenders then this is a great place. The bartenders don't even look you in the eye or say hi to you. Luckily we were with great company so we looked past all those things but if your going to be rude to customers in the bartending industry then maybe this is not the job for you.

Robin W.,/user_details?userid=B6a769IWrPLujhbibvHS_A,"Mesa, AZ",8/28/2021,5.0,"Awesome spot with equally delicious food. This is a spot to go when you are not going for the usual phad Thai but something unique and spicy and memorable. The outdoor seating under the canopy of ref umbrellas is a must. The seats are a bit basic but you're here for the food and it does not disappoint. Servers are prompt and food comes quickly . We chose mild spice with added chili oil on the side snd the spice was perfect, not incendiary but very flavorful . We had a side of noodles which helps to reduce the spice and if you are timid to Thai spicing, I'd suggest that. We had two salads, which come to share, crispy fish over fried rice, and chopped mushrooms and mint, which comes quite hot and then another of the chopped delicious salads, your sever can help guide you. We do not eat pork and it was a breeze navigating the menu which actually was fish and pork forward.  They also have a great drink menu, which is a great way to start.

We ordered quiet a few things to share: papaya salad, Thai prawn sashimi, catfish soup, pad kee mao (asked for a veggie option), sticky rice and rosella beverages. Everything was delicious! Keep in mind the food is spicy and even mild is pretty spicy so if you don't want to have your mouth on fire the mild is more that enough. I loved the fish soup!

Mackenzie A.,/user_details?userid=Sstm0vTyoge71CiJYsGdEw,"Foxboro, MA",10/11/2020,3.0,"I wanted to like this place, but it ended up being a disappointing experience, overall. We had a larger party and sat on the outdoor patio in the back. The aesthetic was super cute and fun, with beautiful stringed lights and nice patio furniture. We started off, or tried to, with an appetizer of the Crab Fried Rice. It didn't end up coming out until all of the other food did, but it was really good. Everyone enjoyed the fresh crab meat on top, and overall, I wish I had gotten just that as my meal. For the meal itself, myself and several others got the Spicy Pad Thai with Shrimp. Our main compliant here is that the wait staff said they couldn't tone down the spice level whatsoever for some of our friends with more sensitive palates. Additionally, our meals all came out at separate times, which was not great since the meals were all hot, so we couldn't end up eating together as a group. This restaurant is also decently new and don't have their liquor license yet, so it was BYOB, but this wasn't advertised until we sat down. Thankfully we did have some wine from a local winery, and the restaurant provided a wine opener and glasses. Also important to note, the service was very slow. We felt bad as there was only 1 server for all of the outdoor tables, but this led to an overall not great dining experience. I wouldn't return in person, but would consider getting the Crab Fried Rice for take out again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/somtum-der-redhook-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

NY strip was done as requested medium well, however the ""side"" of watercress was bland. Not sure if it was meant as a garnish or actually meant as a side salad. Considering the steak was still, a simple dressing drizzled over the watercress would've sealed the deal for me.

david l.,/user_details?userid=74eE-jgCGO24YKIci38UcQ,"Brooklyn, NY",3/27/2021,4.0,Overall a great meal and great service. Steaks are dry aged in house. They are busrting with flavor and super tender. Things I think they can improve on is seasoning. Everything was just slightly under seasoned from the steak to the herb butter. The roasted potatoes was topped with a bit to much herb butter. The Waygu Tartare lacked any flavor. I've never had Japanese Waygu but I understand it to not have a intense beef flavor however the tartare was bland.

We started off with the wagyu sushi, and also got the shrimp crunch, and the 36oz porterhouse steak. The wagyu sushi was okay, we didn't like it but that may just be us because we're not used to eating raw meat. The shrimp crunch was SO good, definitely recommend it. It was fresh, spicy, crunchy, simply delicious. Now the porterhouse, phenomenal. It came out sizzling hot, perfectly juicy and well seasoned. The lemon butter on it was so tasty. Lastly for dessert we got the matcha cake. One of my favorites as well. It was creamy with the perfect matcha flavor that wasn't too little or too much. It went beautifully with the vanilla ice cream. Their pineapple cocktail is also really really good, highly recommend. Staff was so friendly and attentive, service was great.

This has been my second time here, once during the first year opened and second time was the other week. First time I remembered the service could've been better and was very meh, second time was flat out terrible. Reservations were at 9 but we didn't get seated until 9:15. Once they seated us, you would think they cared to ATLEAST ask if we want some water for the table right away like ANY normal place would normally do. But no, we sat there for exactly a whole 30 minutes with no one checking in on us one bit let alone having water on the table!! After the half hour, we had to get up and look for our waiter for his attention in which he replied in such a rude manner!! Yet he still did not service us right away after we had to come up to him. 45 minutes later, and he finally came to take our order!!! RIDICULOUS, with no genuine sincere apology. We were absolutely starving at that rate so we even ordered 2-3 cocktails with him right away knowing that their service would be slow all night just from that start as well as all of our food. Told them it doesn't have to wait for it all to be ready to come to our table or which order whether if entree or appetizer came first... to just fire it all up since we were just so hungry at that rate. But no, the food took awhile to come, and it all just came together. It was so hard to even enjoy the food after being so upset. I remember the first time I ate here I really enjoyed the filet mignon with uni however, the beef and tuna tartares as well as some other dish that is not on the menu this time.

We were seated outside, and although it didn't have the cutest decor, the service and food made up for it. Our waitress was really attentive and sweet but our meal felt a little rushed, possibly due to it being a busy night? Unsure but they were coming to grab our plates pretty quickly even when we weren't finished. For an expensive dinner like this one, I would've expected to be able to savor my meal. Anyway, on to the food! We started with the truffle chawanmushi which was light but flavorful. We also had the fried oysters which I thought were so juicy! I saw people raving about the wagyu tartare so we got that but I would probably skip this next time. The wagyu was unfortunately overpowered by the noodles it came with. The wagyu uni sushi would've probably been a better choice. My absolute favorite was the uni filet mignon - worth the splurge! They are generous with the uni and it is definitely enough to share for two. Being the child I am, I also ordered the cheese fries which were thin and crispy just the way I like them.

Elijah E.,/user_details?userid=QMNCHGrFNVyFkY3ARxtarg,"South Orange, NJ",9/4/2021,5.0,"This was my second time dining at Salt + Charcoal and I'm even more impressed the second time. I had the pleasure of celebrating my 25th birthday here 2 years ago and it was superb. From the Baked Potatoes to the various dipping sauces. And the Porterhouse; one of the best steaks in my life. Cooked to absolute perfection. The first time I visited it was 48 Day aged, and the latter time only 30. No matter, it was just as tender and flavorful as the first time. The customer service is always A1. We wanted to try something a little different after having a lot of hard liquor before we arrived so our waiter recommended we try S+C's signature cocktails which were perfect. Aside from the food and drinks, S+C is one of those smaller niche spots, which is perfect for me and my friends, but don't expect to have a huge dinner here. It's tailored to smaller groups looking for a more intimate setting. The outside seating reminds me of one of those Little Italy mafia hangouts, minus the tacky tablecloths. I mention this spot to anyone I know who enjoys a good steak. A must-have in Williamsburg.

I mean if your salivary glands are working properly, you're in trouble coming here.  I went here on a date with my boyfriend and got carried away literally (and physically :-p) my taste buds were wowed with every bite! From the appetizer down to the entree even the still fancy WATER, YES THE $9 bottle water of Saratoga! It was awesome and so fresh, everything! I looked at the menu and reviews prior to going and I still wasn't ready for the amazement I was about to encounter. For the appetizer we ordered the Salt + Charcoal Crab Cake, it was too divine. It honestly can be a mini meal, it was shared sized portion to tenderize your palate for everything that was about to come. It was delectable even with the garnish salad and wasabi cream sauce on which it was plated. Everything went really well together! For the entree, we did the shared 50 day Jyukusei Porterhouse Steak Steak for two. For sides, cheese fries, grilled broccoli and baked potatoes. Now it was massive! It was definitely a portion made for 2 (or more-they also have for 3 the steak portion). The steak was prepared upon request as medium well. AND WELL IT WAS! Honestly, it was melt in your mouth steak. Not much chewing required.  Just typing this review all over again I want to revisit. The cheese fries I'd say I can skip for the next time because the cheese got cold and wasn't as enjoyable because we were so focused on the other foods we forgot about that mundane order lol. The cheese fries were good but the steak, those sauces and those potatoes was the star of the night! I was stuffed after that meal! There was no way you wouldn't be stuffed. I want to be stuffed some more so some way some how I will be finding my way back to this steakhouse!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Met a friend here for dinner. Very cozy and intimate space with low lighting and a fridge full of aged meat in the front. Was greeted by a very friendly waitress (Kiome). We started off with some lychee martinis, grilled octopus and edamame, which Kiome said was cooked with some secret oil. Both were delicious! The octopus was flavorful and we were given two large tentacles, and the edamame wasn't just all talk. The secret oil was in fact delightful. We shared the 14oz 50 day aged NY Strip. The steak itself was amazing. We got the grilled veggies (apparently from finger lakes), which honestly we probably could've done without (16$ for grilled veggies seems a little steep).

Stacey J.,/user_details?userid=MILzeGI0hWbYmPneKhJXrQ,"Queens, NY",3/28/2021,1.0,"Only come if you have all day to spare(waiting for the food). We had a birthday dinner reservation at 8:15pm, food didn't come until close to 11pm and the restaurant closes at 10pm. I can understand maybe like 30-1 hr waiting time for our food to arrive since it's a Saturday night but no, especially at a ""high end "" restaurant. Nobody should ever wait over 2 hours for their food. Reading other reviews about how the steak made up for the wait... unfortunately it did not. They served us our sides first, that was supposed to be eaten with our main course, then main course came after the sides which baffles me. We ordered porterhouse for 3, medium. It was over cooked and a lot of fatty pieces that you can't even eat. The steak was very chewy and has a lot of muscle fibers in it, making it even harder to chew. Wagyu sushi($24 for 2 pieces) lacked any taste, literally tasted like a piece of garlic. Forgot 2 of the drinks we ordered. We were extremely excited since there are so many good reviews here, but the waiting is no joke and that really take your appetite away. This is not acceptable. The only good thing was the whiskey my bf ordered, that's about it. They did apologize for the wait but it seems like it's a norm here. If you want good quality steak, don't go here. If you want good sushi, don't go here. Only come here if you have the time to wait, like a long catch up session with a friend you haven't seen in ages. There's no reason for steak and sushi to be served over 2 hours late, I mean come on, it's steak and sushi, not braised short ribs. Anyway, super disappointed and will never step afoot in here again. Just a regular restaurant that wants to be fake fancy with its steep price. Saying sorry doesn't change anything, making changes to your mistakes does.

We dined outside since indoor dining is still not back yet. The staff all wore masks and tables were fairly distanced. We started with the wagyu beef uni hand rolls which I actually thought was the wagyu beef tartare because of some of the pictures& captions on yelp but I'm so glad I ordered the wrong thing because these hand rolls were amazing! It was a little over $30 for two pieces but those two pieces left me wanting more! We had to resist since we still had the uni filet mignon coming out. As we waited for our main dish, our waiter brought out some chips for us to munch on. I didn't think the filet mignon would that big so we added some lamb chops. The entrees and the cheese fries came out at the same time which made a really nice full table picture for Instagram but as we began to eat our fries got cold and the cheese wasn't as melted as they looked in the pic. The uni filet mignon was so delicious (I'm drooling for more while posting these pictures). On the menu, it is M.P. for market price. The wait staff will gladly tell you the market price when you order. I ordered without asking and our waiter informed me the price before proceeding with my order. The market price that day for us was around $160 and it was worth every dollar.

I've been wanting to try this place forever and I finally got a chance during quarantine. If you wanna treat yourself during quarantine order togo from here! It was the best meal I have had in months hands down! The steaks are unbelievable! Get that potato too, it's out of this world. Pro tip, ask for truffle oil! The broccoli was cooked perfectly. The edamame is the best edamame I have ever had in my life, who knew grilling edamame was a thing and it kicks up the flavor 100 %. The sushi rolls we tried were also amazing, so fresh and flavorful. You can tell the chefs here really pay attention to detail and put care in the food they are making. I recently visited Japan and this was definitely like being back there.

Maxi L.,/user_details?userid=c3ctd-erq8O6lFXslPiRzw,"New York, NY",5/30/2019,4.0,We came here to celebrate our anniversary. We started with fried oysters and Uni sashimi. Both were good/small  and not filling. We decided to share the Uni fillet mignon as the main dish because we would probably eat again later on. The waiter was phenomenal! Service was excellent! He told us in advance the cut would take about 45 mins to prepare and it would be a good idea to pick out the main course first if we decided to choose steak as an option. We did however waited about an hour+ they  gave us some complimentary lotus chips while we were waiting but it was really taking a long time. We did see a lot of the porter house cut being ordered and we would love to try that next time! The steak finally came and Uni was amazing as always! The fillet mignon cut was very thick to my surprise and it was a great portion to share. But the meat was a bit chewy. It wasn't that soft butter cut that I expected. We asked for medium rare too so I was a bit disappointed. When we saw all of those porter house steaks I thought to myself did we order the wrong item. Because it seemed like we were the only table eating the Uni fillet mignon. But anyway we will be back to try something else.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Annie N.,/user_details?userid=zegMcPCeyd3kjKRP0b5V1w,"Brooklyn, NY",12/20/2017,3.0,"This restaurant is really 3.5 but I kind of expected a little more from them given their location and price so i rounded down. I came here last night for dinner around 8:30 and the tables were taken but the server (a really sweet girl) told us we can sit at the bar until something opens up, we sat ordered our drinks and food and luckily someone left not long after. THE YUZU MOJITO IS BOMB! it was so good i finished it in less than 5 minutes! If you have not tried it yet definitely try it! We ordered the 50 day aged steak and the wagyu... their menu was quite confusing they have the price listed as one price but mentions its (8oz for two people) for the wagyu and min order of two but has the price as $49 next to it...when its suppose to be $98?!?  I don't understand why it wasn't labeled as $98 to begin with if you had to order two minimum but only get one steak?!? Anyways... we had an order of wagyu which was really good, i enjoyed that alot more than they 50 day aged (we ordered medium rare and it came out medium well.) quite dry and a little overcooked .. We got an order of branzino and it was okay but slightly overcooked as well... i think i prefer raw fish more because there's no bones. The wagyu sushi was REALLY GOOD and the Wagyu with uni was really good too those were probably my two favorite dishes the whole night. We also tried the octopus appetizer which was perfectly cooked... I would switch the branzino with hamachi next time. The server was really nice and friendly, water was refilled in a timely manner.   Took off one star for my overcooked 50 day aged steak and one star for the mediocre branzino which was slightly overcooked.. our bill came out to be 400 for three people after tips and tax. I would definitely come back for their cocktails and appetizer.. but probably skip on their steak.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

I would highly recommend the crab cakes as a starter - delicious! The miso soup is the best I've ever tasted. However the reason this is four stars instead of five though is because the duck was a bit chewy and not as tender as I would have hoped - especially when you have to wait 30 minutes more for ordering it! Bonus points for presentation though and the dipping sauces that come with it.

Tatiana f.,/user_details?userid=Tbg3nNccw9yOV3_v11zbvA,"Brooklyn, NY",9/22/2019,5.0,"My friend brought me here to try wagyu for the first time and wow it was an experience like I've never had before. I will caveat that the wagyu steak is very expensive so it might not be in everyone's budget but if you can afford it then it's worth trying at least once. We got the portion for 2 ($150) which comes with 6 3-inch slices of meat (about 2-3 bites per slice) so it's small but it is so packed with flavor, so rich and buttery, that if you get some sides or appetizers you should be satisfied. Wagyu comes from cows bred in japan that are fed a special diet and raised so that they have a high fat content that is intermuscular/marbled within the muscle which creates a texture and taste unlike any other steak. Every bite of meat is like butter with a seared crisp on the outside. I don't know how else to describe it. We also got the wagyu sushi which was my favorite. The matcha cake was good too. The shishito and eggplant starter was delicious. The service was excellent. We sat downstairs which was really intimate, quiet, and cozy. This meal was one of the unforgettable ones.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Hershel P.,/user_details?userid=8y3-L1LHKIUyekhMrbhawQ,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",12/1/2020,5.0,"One the best steak experiences in NYC. In the handful of visits I have had, I was not let down. The service is always great. Very well educated staff. The Wagyu is a must try, as there is no steak that comes close to matching the flavor. I was even able to have a conversation with our waiter to find out he is a native of Miyazaki. Not only is the wagyu to die for, but the dry aged porterhouse will have you drooling as soon as you walk up to be seated. The drooling continues until you see it come to your table with the delicious discs of butter. Cooked perfectly to the requested medium rare, every piece from top to bottom was full of flavor and just melted away. For dessert, the matcha cake is a great fluffy realization that there is room left in your belly. On top of the great food, I've never been let down by any of the cabs or sake I've enjoyed. The restaurant seems to be taking the right precautions to run through COVID and I didn't experience any compromise on the quality of food before or after the pandemic.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Saturday comes around, I call at 12pm, was told that the reservation can only be made by the manager, but the manager won't be in until 2-3pm.

She tells me that the outdoor seating is fully booked by ppl who called ahead of time.

I was looking up places on Yelp and saw that this establishment was number one on the list of restaurants. We decided to go here and we were not disappointed. We arrived around 6:15pm - 6:30pm and were seated immediately. We ordered the 50 day Porterhouse Steak for two with one of the Specials of the day that contained salmon roe, truffle oil, shredded truffle and other fresh ingredients. For drinks, I had the Passion Fizz and the boyfriend got the Yuzu Mule. The drinks were well made and had the perfect balance of alcohol and flavor. Our lovely waitress said that it would take about 45 mins for our rare Porterhouse Steak to be cooked and suggested that we order an appetizer/side while we waited. (That's when we opted for the Special, which was delicious) While we were waiting, our waitress gave us some sort of Veggie Chips, free of charge! All the servers were very attentive and cute! Our waters would always be refilled before hitting the half way point. The Porterhouse steak was beautifully presented and the sauces that went with it, complimented the meat well. My boyfriend and I devoured everything. For dessert, we ordered the salted banana caramel monaka. The presentation was adorable and tasted delightful. We left happy and completely satisfied!

This place came highly recommend we had the dry aged 50 day strip steak for $47.and we were sitting across from the open kitchen and the chef just puts them in the oven. The meat tastes good and cooked to proper temp but oven not hot  enough to get maillard  reaction. They would be better off just searing it in s pan. Then I see them open a bag of frozen fries from Sysco. It's really not difficult to cut potatoes And their ketchup tastes like red gold. Place looks cool but NY is Heinz country.

The meat was tough and greasy ( to be clear it was not marbled and fatty and this maybe coming off as greasy it was just greasy). It was also very over cooked. My waiter honestly didn't really pay attention to us at all he looked at two early twenties girls and probably assumed what a lot of people do, that we wouldn't be spending enough for him to care, which really wasn't true we both were prepared to spend around $150 for each of us.

OMG you must try these)... varied options including divine sushi rolls.  Yes it takes 30 minutes for the grilled meats but once you watch the methods used over the open grill you'll understand why.  Service was fine for me - I've now been here 3x.  The portions are bigger than I thought so just order one sushi roll vs. many and the sides were also ample (asparagus and broccoli were delicious!).  I will be back a 4th time.  Well Done S+C.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

They offer a little small fried lotus root chips to snack on while waiting for food. The service is prompt and friendly and gave plenty of suggestions. We ordered the porterhouse, potatoes, and the grilled octopus. The octopus was tender and not chewy. It was well flavored and perfectly cooked. The taters were OK, nothing too special flavor wise but cooked perfectly. The porterhouse was a bit underwhelming though. It definitely needed the addition of salt and that herb butter. It has a lovely texture and grill marks but flavor wise it didn't scream steak. Most steaks I have are usually eaten without sauces but I felt like the sauces definitely needed to be used.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-charcoal-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

JoJo G.,/user_details?userid=lvui4kiS5rzKGCJs-uELKQ,"New York, NY",10/19/2018,1.0,"What started as a fun friends reunion in NY turned into a very unfortunate event none of us will ever forget or expect for it to happen to anyone in NY. We made a reservation for 6:00 pm for 5 (all women) and were there on time. Our servers were great. Unfortunately around 7:30 pm as we had just ordered our last round of drinks, a man approached our table with check in hand and told us we had exceeded the 2 hour limit they have on tables. We informed him it had not been 2 hrs yet, which was backed up by the hostess. We told him we were waiting for desert, which arrived as we were saying that to him, and that we were waiting on the last round of drinks. We told him that the check needed to be updated to include those items. As rude as his approach had been we were fine with getting the updated check as we were planning to leave by 8 pm anyway.  He came back with an updated check and we asked for the bill to be split evenly into 4(normal in most places) his response was ""I don't know where you are from, but here in America we don't do this"" and was arguing we didn't understand how things work here. To his surprise although upset we all kept our composure and reminded him that this nation is one of immigrants and that as it happens we are all naturalized citizens that arise from different Latin American countries, with the exception of one whose ancestors have been here for hundreds of years. We paid our $600 bill and made sure to leave a 20% tip to our servers because they honestly did not have not have anything to do with their manager's opinions and looked quite embarrassed to be honest. The restaurant had a  group (5) coming in but there were many booths and other tables that had been there longer than us and were no longer consuming anything. The difference is they were all males and not Latinos as he assumed we all were. We left and our driver as scheduled showed up at 7:50 pm we explained what had happened and that we forgot an umbrella and did not feel comfortable going back in by ourselves.  He accompanied me and that same manager approached me with the umbrella in hand. I asked him why he said what he said in a calm tone, I don't believe in shouting to get a point across but rather in showing that educated people can get a point across through conversations. He acknowledge he is an immigrant himself, and said he didn't think it was offensive at first to which our driver responded it was highly inappropriate to say that to any patrons especially to a group of ladies. He asked if the new guests at the table were aware there was a 2 hr maximum and a maximum of cards one can use to which he replied ""no"".  I reminded him that the website nor the hostess made any mention of such rules when we first made the reservation or when we arrived to the restaurant. We reminded him to treat others with respect. It finally felt like he understood what he had said and how he made us feel, he offered his card and a round of drinks to which replied no thanks. I advised him to go through unconscious bias training and to update his website so no one ever would go through what we did. It was embarrassing and quite honestly hurtful. He had a group of professional women as clients, some are also military wives and for us to be judged solely on our ""looks""  even while dressed professionally was quite upsetting. Oh and he was surprised we were fluent in English too.

Sadly I decided to go there for my brother in laws birthday ( a party of 9). We ordered 2 appetizers and individual entrees. We patiently waited but over an hour had gone by and not even the appetizers. My sister goes to what we thought was the manager but turned out to be the owner. With a big smile and nicely asks for an ETA on the food bc we have reservations after for drinks. He proceeds to tell her that "" This isn't mcdonalds."" My sister keeps her cool ( I wouldn't have, to be honest) and replies with "" I'm not trying to give you a hard time. I just have reservations that I don't want to miss"". His wiseass remark was "" oh I won't remeber you tomorrow"" . Naturally my sister retorts back with "" And I won't remeber you"" and calmly comes back to the table. So we almost have our food. They brought the appetizers along with the entrees. Now I must give credit to the servers bc they were apologetic unlike the owner. So now finally the last entree. We get about 2 bites in and the owner brings us the bill. So I commented right to him "" oh we wait and wait but the bill comes really fast. Nice asshole"" I admit I was offended by his awful attitude and customer service. No one was rude or complained until I spoke up.

My first experience was so so but the staff and food quality truly shined the second time around. My specialist (waiter) Johnathan had some true knowledge about the menu and drink pairings for each dish he recommended. I even worked up the courage to try a damn sea urchin. Their twist on the urchin is flavorful and honestly worth a try. The octopus and steak was cooked perfectly over the Japanese charcoals but it's how the subtle ingredients are used with one another that make each dish standout. Here's the thing, I've eaten at many restaurants (high end + low end) and usually leave feeling a little robbed at times either by the quality of food or service. The people here care about the experience provided. I saw the chef watching me with anticipation and confidence from the corner of my eye as I took the first few bites of the steak he prepared.

But they included tip automatically even tho it was just a party of 3. So yea might just order take out from here but never dining in.

As we passed another sweet lady, Stacey greeted us with a great smile and comforted my mother in being on the pier, since it was hard enough to get her there! All was well until we approached the bar. The day was so lovely so I couldn't understand what the ""sour lemon"" face she was making. I asked her for a menu and she points upward and keeps doing what she was doing. No ""hello how are you what can I get you"". Then I ask if I can take it dpwn because I couldn't see it. She spat out something about company policy and kept standing there like we would get the menu thru osmosis and hurry up and order and quit wasting her precious time. Then she unravels a ball of paper and hands it to us. Suprise, a menu. We thanked her kindly and her response to our thank you was silence. I said thank you again...silence again. Then she stood there waiting once more. As my mom begin to order and ask questions she rolled her eyes and looked down for the rest of the order...pursing her lips as though taking our order was the equivalent of being forced to clean a restroom.

Also, when we asked a waitress if she could ask some people to stop smoking, she gave us an attitude about it (even though it's illegal). The best thing about this place? The view is fantastic and it's pleasant to sit in the sun even when it's hot, since there's a breeze. It's best when it's not incredibly crowded.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/pier-66-maritime-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Our favorite dish, the tonnarelli cacio e Pepe was amazing! We also ordered the ravioli with spinach, ricotta, and mushrooms which was great as well.

Joseph T.,/user_details?userid=Cns9kEt9-9wmuvUg3jNz7A,"Brooklyn, NY",7/18/2022,1.0,"I have eaten here on two different occasions with the most recent being 7/17/2022. My girlfriend and I decided to revisit this place after we had come two years ago for my birthday since we didn't get to try the pasta. We sat in their garden area towards the back right of the restaurant. I will say, the pasta did not disappoint. However, the reason for my 1-star review was the rats that were running around behind us. I didn't get through all my pasta when I noticed them and from that moment I couldn't eat anymore. Some other guests there also noticed the rats and one of them even went up to the area where they were to try to get a better look. When I called our waiter over and discreetly mentioned the issue, he nonchalantly told us ""Well, this is Brooklyn. There is nothing I can do about it"". He then asked if we wanted to move inside instead of apologizing about it first. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there so we requested the check. For them to give us a response like that knowing that is a clear health violation that can get the business shut down is unacceptable. It doesn't matter what borough you are in. A visual sign of rats is a clear indication of what is happening inside the restaurant and if it has a chance to affect my food?

Christina G.,/user_details?userid=r2mNNrfcq97V-qaK1taI1A,"Franklin Square, NY",9/13/2020,2.0,"So we did not have a reservation but fortunately we were still able to get a table. My first impression of the place is that they have beautiful greenery but once I interacted with the host he was very snippy and I guess he had his friends at a table because I saw him go over there to sneak a sip to drink a few times. Anyway we were seated on the side walk which was still fine but it took the waitress awhile just to bring water to us and also to even bring the mixed drinks we ordered over. The drinks we had were nothing to rave about. We ordered the croquettes to start and they were delicious but the fried calamari we ordered was dry and oily. For dinner I ordered the ravioli and it was actually pretty decent, we also got skirt steak and it was good but the quantity of the dish was lacking. There was a few slices of steak on a plate but not much to eat. Overall I'm giving this place a 2 star because the hospitality was lacking, waitress was lacking, and food was just ok. At this price point the standards should be higher.

The crab was seasoned and tasted so succulent the greens were so complimented on the dish that it was as perfectly paired as a pb+j sandwich. My boy Sebastian had the short rib burger, looking at the juices flow on that bad boy i said I'll risk it all, Covid? Bring it! I bit in to that bad boy and fell in to a delicious sea of tenderness and perfect seasoning, it was as awesome as encountering your first burger, Revolutionary.

I was so excited to try this place because the decor was really cute but the food and service was terrible. Not once did our waiter come and ask if we were ok or if we needed anything else. We waited about 20-30 mins before we ordered because our waiter was not around. We got the calamari to share, it was alright nothing special. We all got pasta, I forgot the name of the dish but it was absolutely awful!!!! It was soooo salty we barely could eat it, of course our waiter did not bother to ask how the food was. We all left our plate of pasta full because it was just honestly not edible, I could make the dish better myself. I am so disappointed and will definitely not be returning.

Thin crispy batter, the right amounts of salt and super dense calamari. We also had the octopus, which was great in both flavour and consistency too. We followed with pasta. I had a home made saffron pasta with shrimp ragu. It had a distinct flavour of sea, in a good way, and the pasta was cooked al dente. A great pasta dish. My husband had spaghetti vongole- also good but it as memorable. The service was superb throughout. We got a wine recommended that was great with our food.

For brunch I had a salmon dish. It came with avocado, cured salmon, goat cheese, poached egg on a whole wheat bread. Very good. Overall, they use simple but good ingredients to make outstanding dishes and I highly recommend. The prices are moderate. The bill was $95 for three dishes, one appetizer(heirloom squash it was sweet and salty), one drink(mimosa) and 2 lemonades. Lemonade was $4 each. Tasted fresh as if it was homemade.

Audrey T.,/user_details?userid=eYEZq-SeASGAsZ09GURYBw,"Jersey City, NJ",7/11/2018,4.0,"Charming little Italian restaurant in Williamsburg. I came for Sunday brunch and had a pretty good experience. We originally chose this spot because it has a really lovely outdoor garden area, but it ended up being booked out for a private party. The inside of Aurora is very simple with dark wood floors and tables, brick walls, and minimal decor. I got the paccheri pasta with eggplant and mozzarella- it was delicious and I love how all of their pastas are made in house daily. That is quite a rare thing at most Italian restaurants in New York. The only negative is that there weren't that many exciting options on the menu. It was the very usual eggs benedict, frittata, and burger options. Aside from the pastas and burger, there were no non egg options. Would love to see them do something more creative and expand their menu for brunch, lunch, and dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We arrived on a Tuesday evening and despite having multiple tables open both inside and outside, we were not allowed to be seated until our entire party of 3 had arrived. I understand why restaurants have this policy but when 2/3 of the guests are there and the restaurant is empty, I do not understand why the restaurant could not be more accommodating. In addition, when we were deciding on whether or not to get an appetizer the waiter stated ""The chef doesn't do appetizers and insists the plates all come out at one time"". Overall, I though this place was pretentious and I would",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We dropped in a rainy Saturday evening in December. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the wine list and the menu itself offering his favorites when we asked. We started with risotto croquettes and a three cheese plate with figs and honey which were excellent. The white we paired was excellent, moderately priced and was recommended by the waiter. I ordered the butternut squash gnocchi which was incredible, best I ever tasted. I also tried the Montauk sea scallops which were also amazing. Each entree at the table was delicious. After the wine I had a Moretti Rossa which was perfect for my taste buds at that moment. For desert we shared a salted caramel pudding which was no surprise to us also incredibly tasty.

Nichole K.,/user_details?userid=aFHoc8JGImkeHC65pOrxew,"Brooklyn, NY",6/1/2017,5.0,"I struggled if I wanted to give four stars or five, but ultimately, the bottom line is the food was really good. The service was great. The ambience (we sat outside) was beautiful & so welcoming. The prosciutto was so tender & not slimy which prosciutto can sometimes be. The olive oil they put on the table, on a silky note, was one of my favorite parts. They make their own pasta. I love places that do this. You can tell it to. It really is so much better than dried pasta. The two things I didn't like were the amount they gave you. We had a table of about 15. I looked down the table at the end & everyone's plate was licked clean. Yes, that means they like it, but it also means there were some people probably still hungry. For the price, I believe the portion sizes could be a little bigger. The second thing is the Williamsburg 'your lucky to be eating here' that some of the younger generations foster. Let me explain. They don't want to give you bread with olive oil because it makes the tables too messy and the menus get ruined. The menus are printed on a thick resume type paper. Really. Just print more. We were starving b/c our party got there at 7 & didn't order until 8:30. I don't know whose fault it was. It could have easily been someone at our big table causing the lag, so I can't point fingers. But if one end of the table is telling you they are starving, please oblige. It's a restaurant. This goes back to, 'no, we can't give you a side of fresh fruit even though we serve it as a side on another dish.' Mentality, that makes me mad. One reason people go out to eat is because of choices. Enough of my rant. I would eat here again. Although not if I was really hungry.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

My husband and I have had countless brunches in Williamsburg and have generally been pleased, and more often than not very happy with our meals. We often find them to be too much food for one sitting. However, our brunch at Aurora, which has excellent reviews, was not what we expected. I ordered the eggs and potatoes with a salad and when they brought our food, I immediately noticed that the potatoes were four small pieces (about a half inch or less each). I remarked that I guess they ran out of potatoes. The eggs were fine, but not great. I did see people around us with what looked like great pasta dishes so I would probably go back to try that.

At  least two specials, three of their pasta dishes and one of their mains were finished for the night.  So basically diners like my wife and myself were left to order other dishes- that in the end, weren't even prepaired that well.  The best thing I had  was the mixed olive, cheese and meat plate($18) and my $12 glass of wine.  Just a big bummer with a big price tag.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/aurora-brooklyn?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

We have always loved the incredibly delicious food, beautiful, rustic decor and great service. This past July we celebrated my parents' 42nd wedding anniversary at Aurora and 2 weeks ago my husband and I got married in Aurora's picturesque outside space. Jessica coordinated the entire event and was able to create the most beautiful, intimate, chill wedding. We wanted to have a small, laid back, beautiful wedding with good food, good wine and celebrate with our dearest friends and family and that's exactly what Jessica created for us. She surpassed all our hopes for our special day. Everything was so easy and lovely. Perhaps I'm a bit biased, but it was the most perfect, beautiful wedding I've ever been to. Jessica worked with my lovely friend who did the flowers to make sure that the tables and lighting and garlands looked perfect. Emanuele oversaw the food and wine and made sure that everything came out smoothly. Everyone who attended raved about the food, wine and ambiance. Thank you, Aurora for giving us our dream wedding!

I was pleasantly surprised to find mayonnaise as the sauce, but great nonetheless. The only complaint I'd have would be the portion size for branzino. While I'm aware we shared a single main dish, but if I were to eat the whole thing by myself, I'd still want a little bigger size for the price.

We were seated immediately and chose to sit outside. For the appetizer I tried the hummus which came with flatbread. The flat bread and hummus were delicious. We also ordered the steak tartare which is a small plate item and Creekstone skirt steak entree. I wish I had taken a pic of my entree it was delicious and the skirt steak was made exactly how I like it and was flavorful as well. Everything was fresh and delicious! For drinks i ordered a Cigar City Jai Alai IPA on draft and my friend ordered the Blackberry smash. The blackberry splash wasn't that strong in my opinion.

Brunch service was great and the food was on point. We had the tartare, which was nice and fresh with some homemade chips and shaver cheese. Thought it needed a bit more seasoning and was missing some egg yolk but still a good take on tartare in my book. We then had the shrimp and grits. So good. Really peppery with well cooked shrimp and immaculately poached eggs. Absolutely polished the bowl. Lastly the eggs sandwich which was nice and large and came with a side of potatoes that blew our minds. Crispy and salty and homey. They were worth getting all on their own.

Becca R.,/user_details?userid=IDS82GXoIbpVP47NLNyT1w,"New York, NY",10/3/2019,3.0,"Bowery road has a nice, upscale vibe, and good food, but the service was definitely lacking. I got the pre fixe menu for dinner, which is $39 for a small plate, entree, and dessert. All the food was delicious and I feel like it was a really great deal for the quantity of food and quality of food. Highly recommend the crispy rice small plate. My main issue was the server was so slow. The people sitting next to us sat down 10 minutes after us, had a different waiter, and had their appetizers before we had even been asked to order. I felt like there were 30-45 minutes of sitting around waiting for him to take desserts, being refills, or getting his attention for the bill. I had the wrong menu (lunch is different than dinner) and couldn't get his attention for a new one in the first 10 minutes. Luckily my friends let me borrow theirs after selecting what they wanted. The food was good enough, I'll definitely give it another shot and hope my service was a one off.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bowery-road-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

For brunch, I ordered the huevos rancheros (gluten free - corn tortillas) which was ok. The temperature of the eggs/food was a little cold which I didn't enjoy. It was also a very small portion.

I think I first felt it right when I arrived. You're greeted by the huge ceilings, modern decor and a smiling my host. On my recent visit, I sat in the back part of the restaurant. It's a bit cozier than the front, but it offers less people watching. I suggest the area if you're on a date or even want something a bit more away from the bustle for a meeting. Along with great staff and a nice atmosphere, what really sold me on the 5 stars for this spot was the food. Everything was delicious - from the beer can chicken to carrots to my friends steak and the cheesecake dessert. I think the menu here is great because it's super versatile. If you brought a group of friends that all have different flavor preferences, I truly feel they'd be satisfied and happy. Plus, to top it off the cocktails were delicious.

The burger was really good too, but if you don't like pickles, be aware that there are pickles on the burger (not listed on the menu). The fries with the burger were amazing!

Our server was very attentive but we also didn't feel rushed at all which was nice.  The atmosphere is very pleasant as well, taking you right out of the city into a relaxing but chic environment. The food was very fresh and comforting without being too heavy. Also highly recommend the desserts - we shared two and both were delicious!

They were all just tasty, perfectly seasoned & balanced, for lack of a better word to describe the flavors mixed in together. The braised cabbage in the Grilled Pork Chop, for example, was truly braised well and just enough that it still retained its crunchiness. There wasnt a lot of white bean fondue, but it was good enough mix of flavor with the bacon mustard vinaigrette, which satisfied my cravings for bacon without actually eating pieces of bacon at breakfast. They were just enough mix, and oh the pork chop was delightful. I could eat a whole order by myself. Full disclosure - i am a carnivore, and i go for meat over seafood & veggies eap when that meat is flavored incredibly:-). I knocked off a star (would be half a star knocked off if that was possible) because i found the Market Grain Bowl kind of dry:-(. It had a flavor, but it wasnt memorable for me.

We started our night out at the bar with delicious gin cocktails and were then seated once our table was ready. The bartenders and waitresses were very accommodating and even the manager came over to check on us throughout the night (nice touch)! We started with a round of appetizers - Burratta and Avocado Toast, which were both delicious. One of my friends has a severe nut allergy, and they were accommodating and cautious about that, which not every restuarant in NYC always is. Dinner itself was delicious, Ipersonally had the steak and it was thin and to my liking. Overall the ambiance was awesome and made for a perfect girls night. I'd go back for a date night too.

Johanna F.,/user_details?userid=EYiqQxxixe0lIZIHa-c8zw,"Brooklyn, NY",5/24/2018,5.0,"Where do I even begin with this place? For starters, the service is exceptional. We made a reservation for three in advanced but at some places that still requires a long wait. We were seated immediately and our waitress was not only incredibly polite, but super attentive and gave us a ton of very helpful recommendations. We went for dinner and started with some of the dips, spreads, and small plates. My dairy-eating friends had the Lioni Burrata, which apparently was incredibly fresh and delicious. The crushed avocado was delicious and had a pinch of chimichurri in it that really gave it a nice kick. the market salad might sound basic but it was everything but that and the buttermilk dressing really took it to another level. I highly recommend the Roasted Ora King Salmon even if you're not a fan of salmon. It's hard to find a place that does salmon right but this salmon wasn't just tasty but also super smooth and juicy. The brown butter vinaigrette gives it so much flavor and keeps it nice and moist. Let me put it this way, the food is so good you basically want to take your time with each bite. Sure, it might be a little pricey but it's definitely worth it, especially if you're coming for a special occasion or on a dinner date. Now let me get to the drinks. The cocktails here are great. We all had the Andalusian G&T which I was surprised that I liked because I'm not normally a fan of gin. It was strong enough without the gin overpowering the cocktail's sweet flavors. Now let me get to the ambiance of this place because it really is part of what makes this restaurant so special. It has a very romantic industrial feel to it. It's also intimate enough where you can actually have a conversation and hear each other speaking, which is a plus for me when it comes to dining. It's such a pretty place. Like I said, I highly recommend this place for dinner out with friends or for a date, for sure. I plan on coming back soon because I heard the brunch is amazing!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bowery-road-new-york-3?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Then one of the waiters gave it to another party. Took another 15 minutes to get our drinks and only one of them was right. We sent them all back. Then the fire alarm went off.

Intrigue L.,/user_details?userid=rhg7FR4Vm1yPOPX6vmVXIQ,"Brooklyn, NY",8/19/2022,5.0,For the last few days I had been craving oysters and was about to make the trek to sheepshead to dine at one of my fav spots for oysters. But I was in need of a different atmosphere and remembered I had this place saved for quite a bit. Glad I did! Walked into this cozy lil spot and was greeted by smiles and a friendly staff. Sat down and got the ball rolling. Jessica who is probably one of the best servers I've ever met new the menu and told me exactly what to get. Started with the Passion Pisco which was really good but I couldn't get past the frothy egg thing so I had Prosecco after. The oysters which are their signature oysters were really good and we had about 24... they were perfect in size. Crab cakes were moist and crispy. I always find people over salt crab cakes to grab flavor and this was not the case. They were perfect. The poutine was for for 2 and I absolutely loved the devil eggs. I enjoyed the carrot cake but it had a weird bitter taste. Still demolished it.. everything was great and the staff continuously checked up on us and I mean the whole staff not just our server Jessica. We got there exactly at the start of dinner which was empty and by the time we left there was def a crowd. Will be back again!!!!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-crudo-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Clari B.,/user_details?userid=LO_uLZ2ya4VC4JSXqzSFKA,"Brooklyn, NY",8/28/2022,3.0,"I noticed too late people weren't finishing their cocktails and once I got mine it was apparent why. My cocktail, Diego, was super underwhelming with no flavor profile. It left me wanting even a scent of flavor. The oyster shooter didn't come in a shot but a small goblet cup filled with a tremendous amount of underwhelming liquid (I had no spoons so fished out the egg/oyster with a fork. It was challenging yet the best and only good thing about that). The poached octopus was keeping up with the theme of just being edible. They reminded me of canned octopus. Not the budget/affordable kind but the pricy kind (definitely use the lemon, it adds much needed flavor). The snails are to die for! Hands down in the top of best creative take on escargot I have had thus far, brava  (stars for this and the excellent service). The paella was also just meh. The rice was slightly over cooked but the mussels, clam and squid were nicely cooked (not chewy at all) however the shrimp and chorizo were quite tough. Overall I'm glad I get to tick this one off my list of eateries but it is not a go to joint for seafood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-crudo-brooklyn-2?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

The problem I have with this restaurant is their lack of professionalism. On new years evening 2023, my party of 10 was already seated at 6:15pm and the hostess informed us that we had to leave by 7:20pm because they had another party coming in. Let's be for real, we were receiving weird vibes since we walked in. I believe because we were black, they did not want to serve us. We were not a rowdy group, we just wanted some good food while celebrating our cousin's bday. If this place had a party coming in at 7:20pm, why bother sitting my group down at 6:15pm. This place is racist and I will never spend a dime here or recommend anyone come to this establishment.

Overall we had a pleasant experience. We started with the ceviche, which was very good, though could have used something to go with it to add a bit of texture. I had the salmon cubano, which although it was not quite what I was expecting, it was delicious. Huge portion too. Fries were cooked perfectly and the mustard sauce it came with was very flavorful. The octopus dish my girlfriend got was also huge (definitely a good bang for your buck) and it too had a ton of flavor. Drinks were good, server was super friendly and helpful.

I could have totally filled up on the $1 oysters and clams, they were nice and fresh though on the smaller side. The wine specials at $9/glass aren't bad either. The mains we ordered were very good overall. I appreciated the execution and attention to detail but less so with the flavors. I was actually most impressed with the sandwich my husband ordered- it was served on a fluffy ciabatta roll, I don't know how that's even possible- but the charred lemon aioli with my octopus was really interesting as well.

Great atmosphere and music. Very modern interior design. The owner is the same owner as the successful Mexican restaurant next door (Chela). They had a extensive menu with seafood specialties. On Sunday there are $1 oysters all day so we started off with a dozen. Usually $1 oysters can be a hit or miss but their pick was delicious and not too small. My group ordered the bronzino, seafood bouillabaisse, and I had the NY strip. The food was absolutely amazing with lots of purées in the dishes. The price is ok for the area.
