The prices are a bit on the expensive side for the portions, but the food more than makes up for it. The Roti was especially delicious, and the Pad Thai and Pad See Ew were both cooked to perfection.

There were 3 other tables occupied when we arrived at 1:30pm. What it lacks in ambiance is made up for by the incredibly authentic food and hospitality by the owner/chef. As we sampled the flakey chewy roti and summer rolls as appetizers, we already declared this a place to revisit many times over until we've tried the entire menu. The rendang and mee goreng was so full of flavor. You can taste all the complex spices and herbs that were applied with expert technique. No shortcuts were used in the making of our dishes. I'd prefer to keep this place a secret so that it doesn't get overrun with influencers but this is a true diamond in the rough. Will gladly pass on Michelin starred restaurants to come here again.

Katelyn N.,/user_details?userid=tXzYs-Z1g3rV9z50xGZwwg,"Wharton, NJ",8/20/2021,4.0,"I was so excited to try this out due to other reviews! We ordered the Pad thai, seafood curry laksa, roti, and papaya salad. We also ordered thai iced tea and vietnamese iced coffee. The thai iced tea was pretty average, nothing special... but the coffee was delicious-- it was strong but tasty(and that's coming from someone that likes their coffee tasting like ice cream). My boyfriend however likes strong black coffee and he thought it was delicious as well. The roti was GREAT! super flaky but not crumbly if that makes sense .. lol. The papaya salad was probably my least favorite of our meal.. the sauce on top was a lot sweeter than the average papaya salad, flavors just didn't blend well. The pad thai was SPECTACULAR, i have had my fair share of pad thai and this one wasn't exactly the traditional flavor you would find in other places, but it was definitely delicious. It also came spicy which is uncommon (in america at least) but it was a really good spice (not too spicy and added nice flavor). I wouldn't say it's the best i've had but it is definitely up there on the list, i was a happy camper to say the least. The seafood curry laska was just typical curry, and not the best i've had imo. More oily than i would like my curry, but the vegetables were pretty decent, probably would not order again though. The staff was very friendly and very attentive, food came out fast as well. Overall, we enjoyed the experienced but would not be our go to in NYC--lots of competitors out there, but definitely worth the visit!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew

Tanya A.,/user_details?userid=IqHru_e5qyote3UYVU-7SA,"Fort Collins, CO",10/11/2015,4.0,"Free Thai iced tea for checking in! They also brought one for my boyfriend, which was nice of them. We got the roast pork bao appetizer, and I got the nasi lemak as my entree. Although the nasi lemak didn't taste as authentic as the ones I've had in Malaysia, everything was still delicious. We were seated in a weird location next to some tools and an electrical outlet with something plugged into it directly next to my boyfriend's head so he had to lean away while sitting... That was a bit awkward but I'd probably come back if I'm craving Malaysian food again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/lovemama-new-york?adjust_creative=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=YOPxpPg1qGggP5qGSctmew
Keishel L.,/user_details?userid=ekkLSn9UZjZM8wjVzOtvKw,"New York, NY",4/11/2019,5.0,A lovely place to have lunch if you're craving Thai/Malaysian food as they have lunch specials till 3pm! The owner even allowed us to order from the lunch special menu even though we were seated a little past 3pm. Service was quick and the food was definitely a bang for your buck. Tried the curry laksa ($10) and it reminded me of home!
