# Restaurant Recommendation System
EatOut is a media and food tech company operating in Kenya and East Africa since 2010. It provides users with the ability to browse through numerous eateries and hotels, offering crucial data like menus, contacts, maps, events, reviews, and pictures. With the advent of social media, many people rely on influencer and user-generated recommendations on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, which offer a more personalized assessment of the restaurant's ambiance, service, and food, compared to a traditional rating system.

The goal of this project is to develop a content recommender system that provides EatOut users with customized recommendations based on specific keywords and explicit feedback from other users, thus enhancing their competitive advantage. This system will enable users to find relevant recommendations based on specific keywords, thus avoiding the need to browse through countless items.

# Problem Statement

Influencer and user-generated recommendations on social media platforms are becoming increasingly popular, which is affecting the website visits and revenue of food tech businesses such as EatOut. Consequently, there is a need to create a more customized feel to the EatOut website by incorporating a content recommender system that considers explicit feedback from other users and keywords beyond cuisine or ratings.
